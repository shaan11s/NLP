but for some time past he had been in an overstrain irrit condit , verg on hypochondria . he had becom so complet absorb in himself , and isol from hi fellow that he dread meet , not onli hi landladi , but anyon at all . he wa crush by poverti , but the anxieti of hi posit had of late ceas to weigh upon him . he had given up attend to matter of practic import ; he had lost all desir to do so . noth that ani landladi could do had a real terror for him . but to be stop on the stair , to be forc to listen to her trivial , irrelev gossip , to pester demand for payment , threat and complaint , and to rack hi brain for excus , to prevar , to lie -- no , rather than that , he would creep down the stair like a cat and slip out unseen . thi even , howev , on come out into the street , he becam acut awar of hi fear . “ i want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frighten by these trifl , ” he thought , with an odd smile . “ hm ... ye , all is in a man ’ s hand and he let it all slip from cowardic , that ’ s an axiom . it would be interest to know what it is men are most afraid of . take a new step , utter a new word is what they fear most .... but i am talk too much . it ’ s becaus i chatter that i do noth . or perhap it is that i chatter becaus i do noth . i ’ ve learn to chatter thi last month , lie for day togeth in my den think ... of jack the giant-kil . whi am i go there now ? am i capabl of _that_ ? is _that_ seriou ? it is not seriou at all . it ’ s simpli a fantasi to amus myself ; a playth ! ye , mayb it is a plaything. ” the heat in the street wa terribl : and the airless , the bustl and the plaster , scaffold , brick , and dust all about him , and that special petersburg stench , so familiar to all who are unabl to get out of town in summer -- all work pain upon the young man ’ s alreadi overwrought nerv . the insuffer stench from the pot-hous , which are particularli numer in that part of the town , and the drunken men whom he met continu , although it wa a work day , complet the revolt miseri of the pictur . an express of the profoundest disgust gleam for a moment in the young man ’ s refin face . he wa , by the way , except handsom , abov the averag in height , slim , well-built , with beauti dark eye and dark brown hair . soon he sank into deep thought , or more accur speak into a complet blank of mind ; he walk along not observ what wa about him and not care to observ it . from time to time , he would mutter someth , from the habit of talk to himself , to which he had just confess . at these moment he would becom consciou that hi idea were sometim in a tangl and that he wa veri weak ; for two day he had scarc tast food . he wa so badli dress that even a man accustom to shabbi would have been asham to be seen in the street in such rag . in that quarter of the town , howev , scarc ani shortcom in dress would have creat surpris . owe to the proxim of the hay market , the number of establish of bad charact , the preponder of the trade and work class popul crowd in these street and alley in the heart of petersburg , type so variou were to be seen in the street that no figur , howev queer , would have caus surpris . but there wa such accumul bitter and contempt in the young man ’ s heart , that , in spite of all the fastidi of youth , he mind hi rag least of all in the street . it wa a differ matter when he met with acquaint or with former fellow student , whom , inde , he dislik meet at ani time . and yet when a drunken man who , for some unknown reason , wa be taken somewher in a huge waggon drag by a heavi dray hors , suddenli shout at him as he drove past : “ hey there , german hatter ” bawl at the top of hi voic and point at him -- the young man stop suddenli and clutch tremul at hi hat . it wa a tall round hat from zimmerman ’ s , but complet worn out , rusti with age , all torn and bespatt , brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemli fashion . not shame , howev , but quit anoth feel akin to terror had overtaken him . “ i knew it , ” he mutter in confus , “ i thought so ! that ’ s the worst of all ! whi , a stupid thing like thi , the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan . ye , my hat is too notic .... it look absurd and that make it notic .... with my rag i ought to wear a cap , ani sort of old pancak , but not thi grotesqu thing . nobodi wear such a hat , it would be notic a mile off , it would be rememb .... what matter is that peopl would rememb it , and that would give them a clue . for thi busi one should be as littl conspicu as possibl .... trifl , trifl are what matter ! whi , it ’ s just such trifl that alway ruin everyth .... ” he had not far to go ; he knew inde how mani step it wa from the gate of hi lodg hous : exactli seven hundr and thirti . he had count them onc when he had been lost in dream . at the time he had put no faith in those dream and wa onli tantalis himself by their hideou but dare reckless . now , a month later , he had begun to look upon them differ , and , in spite of the monologu in which he jeer at hi own impot and indecis , he had involuntarili come to regard thi “ hideou ” dream as an exploit to be attempt , although he still did not realis thi himself . he wa posit go now for a “ rehears ” of hi project , and at everi step hi excit grew more and more violent . with a sink heart and a nervou tremor , he went up to a huge hous which on one side look on to the canal , and on the other into the street . thi hous wa let out in tini tenement and wa inhabit by work peopl of all kind -- tailor , locksmith , cook , german of sort , girl pick up a live as best they could , petti clerk , etc . there wa a continu come and go through the two gate and in the two courtyard of the hous . three or four door-keep were employ on the build . the young man wa veri glad to meet none of them , and at onc slip unnot through the door on the right , and up the staircas . it wa a back staircas , dark and narrow , but he wa familiar with it alreadi , and knew hi way , and he like all these surround : in such dark even the most inquisit eye were not to be dread . “ if i am so scare now , what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were realli go to do it ? ” he could not help ask himself as he reach the fourth storey . there hi progress wa bar by some porter who were engag in move furnitur out of a flat . he knew that the flat had been occupi by a german clerk in the civil servic , and hi famili . thi german wa move out then , and so the fourth floor on thi staircas would be unten except by the old woman . “ that ’ s a good thing anyway , ” he thought to himself , as he rang the bell of the old woman ’ s flat . the bell gave a faint tinkl as though it were made of tin and not of copper . the littl flat in such hous alway have bell that ring like that . he had forgotten the note of that bell , and now it peculiar tinkl seem to remind him of someth and to bring it clearli befor him .... he start , hi nerv were terribl overstrain by now . in a littl while , the door wa open a tini crack : the old woman eye her visitor with evid distrust through the crack , and noth could be seen but her littl eye , glitter in the dark . but , see a number of peopl on the land , she grew bolder , and open the door wide . the young man step into the dark entri , which wa partit off from the tini kitchen . the old woman stood face him in silenc and look inquiringli at him . she wa a diminut , wither up old woman of sixti , with sharp malign eye and a sharp littl nose . her colourless , somewhat grizzl hair wa thickli smear with oil , and she wore no kerchief over it . round her thin long neck , which look like a hen ’ s leg , wa knot some sort of flannel rag , and , in spite of the heat , there hung flap on her shoulder , a mangi fur cape , yellow with age . the old woman cough and groan at everi instant . the young man must have look at her with a rather peculiar express , for a gleam of mistrust came into her eye again . “ raskolnikov , a student , i came here a month ago , ” the young man made hast to mutter , with a half bow , rememb that he ought to be more polit . “ i rememb , my good sir , i rememb quit well your come here , ” the old woman said distinctli , still keep her inquir eye on hi face . “ and here ... i am again on the same errand , ” raskolnikov continu , a littl disconcert and surpris at the old woman ’ s mistrust . “ perhap she is alway like that though , onli i did not notic it the other time , ” he thought with an uneasi feel . the old woman paus , as though hesit ; then step on one side , and point to the door of the room , she said , let her visitor pass in front of her : “ step in , my good sir. ” the littl room into which the young man walk , with yellow paper on the wall , geranium and muslin curtain in the window , wa brightli light up at that moment by the set sun . “ so the sun will shine like thi _then_ too ! ” flash as it were by chanc through raskolnikov ’ s mind , and with a rapid glanc he scan everyth in the room , tri as far as possibl to notic and rememb it arrang . but there wa noth special in the room . the furnitur , all veri old and of yellow wood , consist of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back , an oval tabl in front of the sofa , a dressing-t with a looking-glass fix on it between the window , chair along the wall and two or three half-penni print in yellow frame , repres german damsel with bird in their hand -- that wa all . in the corner a light wa burn befor a small ikon . everyth wa veri clean ; the floor and the furnitur were brightli polish ; everyth shone . “ lizaveta ’ s work , ” thought the young man . there wa not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat . “ it ’ s in the hous of spite old widow that one find such cleanli , ” raskolnikov thought again , and he stole a curiou glanc at the cotton curtain over the door lead into anoth tini room , in which stood the old woman ’ s bed and chest of drawer and into which he had never look befor . these two room made up the whole flat . “ what do you want ? ” the old woman said sever , come into the room and , as befor , stand in front of him so as to look him straight in the face . “ i ’ ve brought someth to pawn here , ” and he drew out of hi pocket an old-fashion flat silver watch , on the back of which wa engrav a globe ; the chain wa of steel . “ but the time is up for your last pledg . the month wa up the day befor yesterday. ” “ i will bring you the interest for anoth month ; wait a little. ” “ but that ’ s for me to do as i pleas , my good sir , to wait or to sell your pledg at once. ” “ how much will you give me for the watch , alyona ivanovna ? ” “ you come with such trifl , my good sir , it ’ s scarc worth anyth . i gave you two roubl last time for your ring and one could buy it quit new at a jewel ’ s for a roubl and a half. ” “ give me four roubl for it , i shall redeem it , it wa my father ’ s . i shall be get some money soon. ” “ a roubl and a half , and interest in advanc , if you like ! ” “ a roubl and a half ! ” cri the young man . “ pleas yourself ” -- and the old woman hand him back the watch . the young man took it , and wa so angri that he wa on the point of go away ; but check himself at onc , rememb that there wa nowher els he could go , and that he had had anoth object also in come . “ hand it over , ” he said roughli . the old woman fumbl in her pocket for her key , and disappear behind the curtain into the other room . the young man , left stand alon in the middl of the room , listen inquisit , think . he could hear her unlock the chest of drawer . “ it must be the top drawer , ” he reflect . “ so she carri the key in a pocket on the right . all in one bunch on a steel ring .... and there ’ s one key there , three time as big as all the other , with deep notch ; that can ’ t be the key of the chest of drawer ... then there must be some other chest or strong-box ... that ’ s worth know . strong-box alway have key like that ... but how degrad it all is. ” the old woman came back . “ here , sir : as we say ten copeck the roubl a month , so i must take fifteen copeck from a roubl and a half for the month in advanc . but for the two roubl i lent you befor , you owe me now twenti copeck on the same reckon in advanc . that make thirty-f copeck altogeth . so i must give you a roubl and fifteen copeck for the watch . here it is. ” “ what ! onli a roubl and fifteen copeck now ! ” “ just so. ” the young man did not disput it and took the money . he look at the old woman , and wa in no hurri to get away , as though there wa still someth he want to say or to do , but he did not himself quit know what . “ i may be bring you someth els in a day or two , alyona ivanovna -- a valuabl thing -- silver -- a cigarette-box , as soon as i get it back from a friend ... ” he broke off in confus . “ well , we will talk about it then , sir. ” “ good-by -- are you alway at home alon , your sister is not here with you ? ” he ask her as casual as possibl as he went out into the passag . “ what busi is she of your , my good sir ? ” “ oh , noth particular , i simpli ask . you are too quick .... good-day , alyona ivanovna. ” raskolnikov went out in complet confus . thi confus becam more and more intens . as he went down the stair , he even stop short , two or three time , as though suddenli struck by some thought . when he wa in the street he cri out , “ oh , god , how loathsom it all is ! and can i , can i possibl .... no , it ’ s nonsens , it ’ s rubbish ! ” he ad resolut . “ and how could such an atroci thing come into my head ? what filthi thing my heart is capabl of . ye , filthi abov all , disgust , loathsom , loathsom ! -- and for a whole month i ’ ve been .... ” but no word , no exclam , could express hi agit . the feel of intens repuls , which had begun to oppress and tortur hi heart while he wa on hi way to the old woman , had by now reach such a pitch and had taken such a definit form that he did not know what to do with himself to escap from hi wretched . he walk along the pavement like a drunken man , regardless of the passers-bi , and jostl against them , and onli came to hi sens when he wa in the next street . look round , he notic that he wa stand close to a tavern which wa enter by step lead from the pavement to the basement . at that instant two drunken men came out at the door , and abus and support one anoth , they mount the step . without stop to think , raskolnikov went down the step at onc . till that moment he had never been into a tavern , but now he felt giddi and wa torment by a burn thirst . he long for a drink of cold beer , and attribut hi sudden weak to the want of food . he sat down at a sticki littl tabl in a dark and dirti corner ; order some beer , and eagerli drank off the first glass . at onc he felt easier ; and hi thought becam clear . “ all that ’ s nonsens , ” he said hope , “ and there is noth in it all to worri about ! it ’ s simpli physic derang . just a glass of beer , a piec of dri bread -- and in one moment the brain is stronger , the mind is clearer and the will is firm ! phew , how utterli petti it all is ! ” but in spite of thi scorn reflect , he wa by now look cheer as though he were suddenli set free from a terribl burden : and he gaze round in a friendli way at the peopl in the room . but even at that moment he had a dim forebod that thi happier frame of mind wa also not normal . there were few peopl at the time in the tavern . besid the two drunken men he had met on the step , a group consist of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time . their departur left the room quiet and rather empti . the person still in the tavern were a man who appear to be an artisan , drunk , but not extrem so , sit befor a pot of beer , and hi companion , a huge , stout man with a grey beard , in a short full-skirt coat . he wa veri drunk : and had drop asleep on the bench ; everi now and then , he began as though in hi sleep , crack hi finger , with hi arm wide apart and the upper part of hi bodi bound about on the bench , while he hum some meaningless refrain , tri to recal some such line as these : “ hi wife a year he fondli love hi wife a -- a year he -- fondli loved. ” or suddenli wake up again : “ walk along the crowd row he met the one he use to know. ” but no one share hi enjoy : hi silent companion look with posit hostil and mistrust at all these manifest . there wa anoth man in the room who look somewhat like a retir govern clerk . he wa sit apart , now and then sip from hi pot and look round at the compani . he , too , appear to be in some agit . chapter ii raskolnikov wa not use to crowd , and , as we said befor , he avoid societi of everi sort , more especi of late . but now all at onc he felt a desir to be with other peopl . someth new seem to be take place within him , and with it he felt a sort of thirst for compani . he wa so weari after a whole month of concentr wretched and gloomi excit that he long to rest , if onli for a moment , in some other world , whatev it might be ; and , in spite of the filthi of the surround , he wa glad now to stay in the tavern . the master of the establish wa in anoth room , but he frequent came down some step into the main room , hi jaunti , tar boot with red turn-ov top come into view each time befor the rest of hi person . he wore a full coat and a horribl greasi black satin waistcoat , with no cravat , and hi whole face seem smear with oil like an iron lock . at the counter stood a boy of about fourteen , and there wa anoth boy somewhat younger who hand whatev wa want . on the counter lay some slice cucumb , some piec of dri black bread , and some fish , chop up small , all smell veri bad . it wa insuffer close , and so heavi with the fume of spirit that five minut in such an atmospher might well make a man drunk . there are chanc meet with stranger that interest us from the first moment , befor a word is spoken . such wa the impress made on raskolnikov by the person sit a littl distanc from him , who look like a retir clerk . the young man often recal thi impress afterward , and even ascrib it to presenti . he look repeatedli at the clerk , partli no doubt becaus the latter wa stare persist at him , obvious anxiou to enter into convers . at the other person in the room , includ the tavern-keep , the clerk look as though he were use to their compani , and weari of it , show a shade of condescend contempt for them as person of station and cultur inferior to hi own , with whom it would be useless for him to convers . he wa a man over fifti , bald and grizzl , of medium height , and stoutli built . hi face , bloat from continu drink , wa of a yellow , even greenish , ting , with swollen eyelid out of which keen reddish eye gleam like littl chink . but there wa someth veri strang in him ; there wa a light in hi eye as though of intens feel -- perhap there were even thought and intellig , but at the same time there wa a gleam of someth like mad . he wa wear an old and hopelessli rag black dress coat , with all it button miss except one , and that one he had button , evid cling to thi last trace of respect . a crumpl shirt front , cover with spot and stain , protrud from hi canva waistcoat . like a clerk , he wore no beard , nor moustach , but had been so long unshaven that hi chin look like a stiff greyish brush . and there wa someth respect and like an offici about hi manner too . but he wa restless ; he ruffl up hi hair and from time to time let hi head drop into hi hand dejectedli rest hi rag elbow on the stain and sticki tabl . at last he look straight at raskolnikov , and said loudli and resolut : “ may i ventur , honour sir , to engag you in polit convers ? forasmuch as , though your exterior would not command respect , my experi admonish me that you are a man of educ and not accustom to drink . i have alway respect educ when in conjunct with genuin sentiment , and i am besid a titular counsellor in rank . marmeladov -- such is my name ; titular counsellor . i make bold to inquir -- have you been in the servic ? ” “ no , i am studi , ” answer the young man , somewhat surpris at the grandiloqu style of the speaker and also at be so directli address . in spite of the momentari desir he had just been feel for compani of ani sort , on be actual spoken to he felt immedi hi habitu irrit and uneasi avers for ani stranger who approach or attempt to approach him . “ a student then , or formerli a student , ” cri the clerk . “ just what i thought ! i ’ m a man of experi , immens experi , sir , ” and he tap hi forehead with hi finger in self-approv . “ you ’ ve been a student or have attend some learn institut ! ... but allow me .... ” he got up , stagger , took up hi jug and glass , and sat down besid the young man , face him a littl sideway . he wa drunk , but spoke fluentli and boldli , onli occasion lose the thread of hi sentenc and drawl hi word . he pounc upon raskolnikov as greedili as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month . “ honour sir , ” he began almost with solemn , “ poverti is not a vice , that ’ s a true say . yet i know too that drunken is not a virtu , and that that ’ s even truer . but beggari , honour sir , beggari is a vice . in poverti you may still retain your innat nobil of soul , but in beggari -- never -- no one . for beggari a man is not chase out of human societi with a stick , he is swept out with a broom , so as to make it as humili as possibl ; and quit right , too , forasmuch as in beggari i am readi to be the first to humili myself . henc the pot-hous ! honour sir , a month ago mr. lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beat , and my wife is a veri differ matter from me ! do you understand ? allow me to ask you anoth question out of simpl curios : have you ever spent a night on a hay barg , on the neva ? ” “ no , i have not happen to , ” answer raskolnikov . “ what do you mean ? ” “ well , i ’ ve just come from one and it ’ s the fifth night i ’ ve slept so .... ” he fill hi glass , empti it and paus . bit of hay were in fact cling to hi cloth and stick to hi hair . it seem quit probabl that he had not undress or wash for the last five day . hi hand , particularli , were filthi . they were fat and red , with black nail . hi convers seem to excit a gener though languid interest . the boy at the counter fell to snigger . the innkeep came down from the upper room , appar on purpos to listen to the “ funni fellow ” and sat down at a littl distanc , yawn lazili , but with digniti . evid marmeladov wa a familiar figur here , and he had most like acquir hi weak for high-flown speech from the habit of frequent enter into convers with stranger of all sort in the tavern . thi habit develop into a necess in some drunkard , and especi in those who are look after sharpli and kept in order at home . henc in the compani of other drinker they tri to justifi themselv and even if possibl obtain consider . “ funni fellow ! ” pronounc the innkeep . “ and whi don ’ t you work , whi aren ’ t you at your duti , if you are in the servic ? ” “ whi am i not at my duti , honour sir , ” marmeladov went on , address himself exclus to raskolnikov , as though it had been he who put that question to him . “ whi am i not at my duti ? doe not my heart ach to think what a useless worm i am ? a month ago when mr. lebeziatnikov beat my wife with hi own hand , and i lay drunk , didn ’ t i suffer ? excus me , young man , ha it ever happen to you ... hm ... well , to petit hopelessli for a loan ? ” “ ye , it ha . but what do you mean by hopelessli ? ” “ hopelessli in the fullest sens , when you know beforehand that you will get noth by it . you know , for instanc , beforehand with posit certainti that thi man , thi most reput and exemplari citizen , will on no consider give you money ;

( for my daughter ha a yellow passport ) , ” he ad in parenthesi , look with a certain uneasi at the young man . “ no matter , sir , no matter ! ” he went on hurriedli and with appar composur when both the boy at the counter guffaw and even the innkeep smile -- “ no matter , i am not confound by the wag of their head ; for everyon know everyth about it alreadi , and all that is secret is made open . and i accept it all , not with contempt , but with humil . so be it ! so be it ! ‘ behold the man ! ’ excus me , young man , can you .... no , to put it more strongli and more distinctli ; not _can_ you but _dare_ you , look upon me , assert that i am not a pig ? ” the young man did not answer a word . “ well , ” the orat began again stolidli and with even increas digniti , after wait for the laughter in the room to subsid . “ well , so be it , i am a pig , but she is a ladi ! i have the semblanc of a beast , but katerina ivanovna , my spous , is a person of educ and an offic ’ s daughter . grant , grant , i am a scoundrel , but she is a woman of a nobl heart , full of sentiment , refin by educ . and yet ... oh , if onli she felt for me ! honour sir , honour sir , you know everi man ought to have at least one place where peopl feel for him ! but katerina ivanovna , though she is magnanim , she is unjust .... and yet , although i realis that when she pull my hair she onli doe it out of piti -- for i repeat without be asham , she pull my hair , young man , ” he declar with redoubl digniti , hear the snigger again -- “ but , my god , if she would but onc .... but no , no ! it ’ s all in vain and it ’ s no use talk ! no use talk ! for more than onc , my wish did come true and more than onc she ha felt for me but ... such is my fate and i am a beast by natur ! ” “ rather ! ” assent the innkeep yawn . marmeladov struck hi fist resolut on the tabl . “ such is my fate ! do you know , sir , do you know , i have sold her veri stock for drink ? not her shoe -- that would be more or less in the order of thing , but her stock , her stock i have sold for drink ! her mohair shawl i sold for drink , a present to her long ago , her own properti , not mine ; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold thi winter and ha begun cough and spit blood too . we have three littl children and katerina ivanovna is at work from morn till night ; she is scrub and clean and wash the children , for she ’ s been use to cleanli from a child . but her chest is weak and she ha a tendenc to consumpt and i feel it ! do you suppos i don ’ t feel it ? and the more i drink the more i feel it . that ’ s whi i drink too . i tri to find sympathi and feel in drink .... i drink so that i may suffer twice as much ! ” and as though in despair he laid hi head down on the tabl . “ young man , ” he went on , rais hi head again , “ in your face i seem to read some troubl of mind . when you came in i read it , and that wa whi i address you at onc . for in unfold to you the stori of my life , i do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock befor these idl listen , who inde know all about it alreadi , but i am look for a man of feel and educ . know then that my wife wa educ in a high-class school for the daughter of noblemen , and on leav she danc the shawl danc befor the governor and other personag for which she wa present with a gold medal and a certif of merit . the medal ... well , the medal of cours wa sold -- long ago , hm ... but the certif of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she show it to our landladi . and although she is most continu on bad term with the landladi , yet she want to tell someon or other of her past honour and of the happi day that are gone . i don ’ t condemn her for it , i don ’ t blame her , for the one thing left her is recollect of the past , and all the rest is dust and ash . ye , ye , she is a ladi of spirit , proud and determin . she scrub the floor herself and ha noth but black bread to eat , but won ’ t allow herself to be treat with disrespect . that ’ s whi she would not overlook mr. lebeziatnikov ’ s rude to her , and so when he gave her a beat for it , she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feel than from the blow . she wa a widow when i marri her , with three children , one smaller than the other . she marri her first husband , an infantri offic , for love , and ran away with him from her father ’ s hous . she wa exceedingli fond of her husband ; but he gave way to card , got into troubl and with that he die . he use to beat her at the end : and although she paid him back , of which i have authent documentari evid , to thi day she speak of him with tear and she throw him up to me ; and i am glad , i am glad that , though onli in imagin , she should think of herself as have onc been happi .... and she wa left at hi death with three children in a wild and remot district where i happen to be at the time ; and she wa left in such hopeless poverti that , although i have seen mani up and down of all sort , i don ’ t feel equal to describ it even . her relat had all thrown her off . and she wa proud , too , excess proud .... and then , honour sir , and then , i , be at the time a widow , with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife , offer her my hand , for i could not bear the sight of such suffer . you can judg the extrem of her calam , that she , a woman of educ and cultur and distinguish famili , should have consent to be my wife . but she did ! weep and sob and wring her hand , she marri me ! for she had nowher to turn ! do you understand , sir , do you understand what it mean when you have absolut nowher to turn ? no , that you don ’ t understand yet .... and for a whole year , i perform my duti conscienti and faith , and did not touch thi ” ( he tap the jug with hi finger ) , “ for i have feel . but even so , i could not pleas her ; and then i lost my place too , and that through no fault of mine but through chang in the offic ; and then i did touch it ! ... it will be a year and a half ago soon sinc we found ourselv at last after mani wander and numer calam in thi magnific capit , adorn with innumer monument . here i obtain a situat .... i obtain it and i lost it again . do you understand ? thi time it wa through my own fault i lost it : for my weak had come out .... we have now part of a room at amalia fyodorovna lippevechsel ’ s ; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with , i could not say . there are a lot of peopl live there besid ourselv . dirt and disord , a perfect bedlam ... hm ... ye ... and meanwhil my daughter by my first wife ha grown up ; and what my daughter ha had to put up with from her step-moth whilst she wa grow up , i won ’ t speak of . for , though katerina ivanovna is full of gener feel , she is a spirit ladi , irrit and short-temp .... ye . but it ’ s no use go over that ! sonia , as you may well fanci , ha had no educ . i did make an effort four year ago to give her a cours of geographi and univers histori , but as i wa not veri well up in those subject myself and we had no suitabl book , and what book we had ... hm , anyway we have not even those now , so all our instruct came to an end . we stop at cyru of persia . sinc she ha attain year of matur , she ha read other book of romant tendenc and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through mr. lebeziatnikov , lew ’ physiolog -- do you know it ? -- and even recount extract from it to us : and that ’ s the whole of her educ . and now may i ventur to address you , honour sir , on my own account with a privat question . do you suppos that a respect poor girl can earn much by honest work ? not fifteen farth a day can she earn , if she is respect and ha no special talent and that without put her work down for an instant ! and what ’ s more , ivan ivanitch klopstock the civil counsellor -- have you heard of him ? -- ha not to thi day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirt she made him and drove her roughli away , stamp and revil her , on the pretext that the shirt collar were not made like the pattern and were put in askew . and there are the littl one hungri .... and katerina ivanovna walk up and down and wring her hand , her cheek flush red , as they alway are in that diseas : ‘ here you live with us , ’ say she , ‘ you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do noth to help. ’ and much she get to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the littl one for three day ! i wa lie at the time ... well , what of it ! i wa lie drunk and i heard my sonia speak ( she is a gentl creatur with a soft littl voic ... fair hair and such a pale , thin littl face ) . she said : ‘ katerina ivanovna , am i realli to do a thing like that ? ’ and darya frantsovna , a woman of evil charact and veri well known to the polic , had two or three time tri to get at her through the landladi . ‘ and whi not ? ’ said katerina ivanovna with a jeer , ‘ you are someth mighti preciou to be so care of ! ’ but don ’ t blame her , don ’ t blame her , honour sir , don ’ t blame her ! she wa not herself when she spoke , but driven to distract by her ill and the cri of the hungri children ; and it wa said more to wound her than anyth els .... for that ’ s katerina ivanovna ’ s charact , and when children cri , even from hunger , she fall to beat them at onc . at six o ’ clock i saw sonia get up , put on her kerchief and her cape , and go out of the room and about nine o ’ clock she came back . she walk straight up to katerina ivanovna and she laid thirti roubl on the tabl befor her in silenc . she did not utter a word , she did not even look at her , she simpli pick up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl ( we have a shawl , made of _drap de dames_ ) , put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall ; onli her littl shoulder and her bodi kept shudder .... and i went on lie there , just as befor .... and then i saw , young man , i saw katerina ivanovna , in the same silenc go up to sonia ’ s littl bed ; she wa on her knee all the even kiss sonia ’ s feet , and would not get up , and then they both fell asleep in each other ’ s arm ... togeth , togeth ... ye ... and i ... lay drunk. ” marmeladov stop short , as though hi voic had fail him . then he hurriedli fill hi glass , drank , and clear hi throat . “ sinc then , sir , ” he went on after a brief paus -- “ sinc then , owe to an unfortun occurr and through inform given by evil-intent person -- in all which darya frantsovna took a lead part on the pretext that she had been treat with want of respect -- sinc then my daughter sofya semyonovna ha been forc to take a yellow ticket , and owe to that she is unabl to go on live with us . for our landladi , amalia fyodorovna would not hear of it ( though she had back up darya frantsovna befor ) and mr. lebeziatnikov too ... hm .... all the troubl between him and katerina ivanovna wa on sonia ’ s account . at first he wa for make up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on hi digniti : ‘ how , ’ said he , ‘ can a highli educ man like me live in the same room with a girl like that ? ’ and katerina ivanovna would not let it pass , she stood up for her ... and so that ’ s how it happen . and sonia come to us now , mostli after dark ; she comfort katerina ivanovna and give her all she can .... she ha a room at the kapernaumov ’ the tailor , she lodg with them ; kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palat and all of hi numer famili have cleft palat too . and hi wife , too , ha a cleft palat . they all live in one room , but sonia ha her own , partit off .... hm ... ye ... veri poor peopl and all with cleft palat ... ye . then i got up in the morn , and put on my rag , lift up my hand to heaven and set off to hi excel ivan afanasyvitch . hi excel ivan afanasyvitch , do you know him ? no ? well , then , it ’ s a man of god you don ’ t know . he is wax ... wax befor the face of

said , ‘ rememb , ’ he said , ‘ and now you can go. ’ i kiss the dust at hi feet -- in thought onli , for in realiti he would not have allow me to do it , be a statesman and a man of modern polit and enlighten idea . i return home , and when i announc that i ’ d been taken back into the servic and should receiv a salari , heaven , what a to-do there wa ! ... ” marmeladov stop again in violent excit . at that moment a whole parti of revel alreadi drunk came in from the street , and the sound of a hire concertina and the crack pipe voic of a child of seven sing “ the hamlet ” were heard in the entri . the room wa fill with nois . the tavern-keep and the boy were busi with the new-com . marmeladov pay no attent to the new arriv continu hi stori . he appear by now to be extrem weak , but as he becam more and more drunk , he becam more and more talk . the recollect of hi recent success in get the situat seem to reviv him , and wa posit reflect in a sort of radianc on hi face . raskolnikov listen attent . “ that wa five week ago , sir . ye .... as soon as katerina ivanovna and sonia heard of it , merci on us , it wa as though i step into the kingdom of heaven . it use to be : you can lie like a beast , noth but abus . now they were walk on tipto , hush the children . ‘ semyon zaharovitch is tire with hi work at the offic , he is rest , shh ! ’ they made me coffe befor i went to work and boil cream for me ! they began to get real cream for me , do you hear that ? and how they manag to get togeth the money for a decent outfit -- eleven roubl , fifti copeck , i can ’ t guess . boot , cotton shirt-front -- most magnific , a uniform , they got up all in splendid style , for eleven roubl and a half . the first morn i came back from the offic i found katerina ivanovna had cook two cours for dinner -- soup and salt meat with hors radish -- which we had never dream of till then . she had not ani dress ... none at all , but she got herself up as though she were go on a visit ; and not that she ’ d anyth to do it with , she smarten herself up with noth at all , she ’ d done her hair nice , put on a clean collar of some sort , cuff , and there she wa , quit a differ person , she wa younger and better look . sonia , my littl darl , had onli help with money ‘ for the time , ’ she said , ‘ it won ’ t do for me to come and see you too often . after dark mayb when no one can see. ’ do you hear , do you hear ? i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think : though katerina ivanovna had quarrel to the last degre with our landladi amalia fyodorovna onli a week befor , she could not resist then ask her in to coffe . for two hour they were sit , whisper togeth . ‘ semyon zaharovitch is in the servic again , now , and receiv a salari , ’ say she , ‘ and he went himself to hi excel and hi excel himself came out to him , made all the other wait and led semyon zaharovitch by the hand befor everybodi into hi study. ’ do you hear , do you hear ? ‘ to be

you would not think me a beauti , you would not think much of me as a husband , would you ? ... well , she pinch my cheek , ‘ my littl poppet , ’ said she. ” marmeladov broke off , tri to smile , but suddenli hi chin began to twitch . he control himself howev . the tavern , the degrad appear of the man , the five night in the hay barg , and the pot of spirit , and yet thi poignant love for hi wife and children bewild hi listen . raskolnikov listen intent but with a sick sensat . he felt vex that he had come here . “ honour sir , honour sir , ” cri marmeladov recov himself -- “ oh , sir , perhap all thi seem a laugh matter to you , as it doe to other , and perhap i am onli worri you with the stupid of all the trivial detail of my home life , but it is not a laugh matter to me . for i can feel it all .... and the whole of that heavenli day of my life and the whole of that even i pass in fleet dream of how i would arrang it all , and how i would dress all the children , and how i should give her rest , and how i should rescu my own daughter from dishonour and restor her to the bosom of her famili .... and a great deal more .... quit excus , sir . well , then , sir ” ( marmeladov suddenli gave a sort of start , rais hi head and gaze intent at hi listen ) “ well , on the veri next day after all those dream , that is to say , exactli five day ago , in the even , by a cun trick , like a thief in the night , i stole from katerina ivanovna the key of her box , took out what wa left of my earn , how much it wa i have forgotten , and now look at me , all of you ! it ’ s the fifth day sinc i left home , and they are look for me there and it ’ s the end of my employ , and my uniform is lie in a tavern on the egyptian bridg . i exchang it for the garment i have on ... and it ’ s the end of everyth ! ” marmeladov struck hi forehead with hi fist , clench hi teeth , close hi eye and lean heavili with hi elbow on the tabl . but a minut later hi face suddenli chang and with a certain assum slyness and affect of bravado , he glanc at raskolnikov , laugh and said : “ thi morn i went to see sonia , i went to ask her for a pick-me-up ! he-he-h ! ” “ you don ’ t say she gave it to you ? ” cri one of the new-com ; he shout the word and went off into a guffaw . “ thi veri quart wa bought with her money , ” marmeladov declar , address himself exclus to raskolnikov . “ thirti copeck she gave me with her own hand , her last , all she had , as i saw .... she said noth , she onli look at me without a word .... not on earth , but up yonder ... they griev over men , they weep , but they don ’ t blame them , they don ’ t blame them ! but it hurt more , it hurt more when they don ’ t blame ! thirti copeck ye ! and mayb she need them now , eh ? what do you think , my dear sir ? for

. shout of laughter and even oath follow . the laughter and the oath came from those who were listen and also from those who had heard noth but were simpli look at the figur of the discharg govern clerk . “ to be piti ! whi am i to be piti ? ” marmeladov suddenli declaim , stand up with hi arm outstretch , as though he had been onli wait for that question . “ whi am i to be piti , you say ? ye ! there ’ s noth to piti me for ! i ought to be crucifi , crucifi on a cross , not piti ! crucifi me , oh judg , crucifi me but piti me ! and then i will go of myself to be crucifi , for it ’ s not

of hi surround and plung in deep thought . hi word had creat a certain impress ; there wa a moment of silenc ; but soon laughter and oath were heard again . “ that ’ s hi notion ! ” “ talk himself silli ! ” “ a fine clerk he is ! ” and so on , and so on . “ let us go , sir , ” said marmeladov all at onc , rais hi head and address raskolnikov -- “ come along with me ... kozel ’ s hous , look into the yard . i ’ m go to katerina ivanovna -- time i did. ” raskolnikov had for some time been want to go and he had meant to help him . marmeladov wa much unsteadi on hi leg than in hi speech and lean heavili on the young man . they had two or three hundr pace to go . the drunken man wa more and more overcom by dismay and confus as they drew nearer the hous . “ it ’ s not katerina ivanovna i am afraid of now , ” he mutter in agit -- “ and that she will begin pull my hair . what doe my hair matter ! bother my hair ! that ’ s what i say ! inde it will be better if she doe begin pull it ,

there is the hous . the hous of kozel , the cabinet-mak ... a german , well-to-do . lead the way ! ” they went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey . the staircas got darker and darker as they went up . it wa nearli eleven o ’ clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night , yet it wa quit dark at the top of the stair . a grimi littl door at the veri top of the stair stood ajar . a veri poor-look room about ten pace long wa light up by a candle-end ; the whole of it wa visibl from the entranc . it wa all in disord , litter up with rag of all sort , especi children

befor which stood an old deal kitchen-t , unpaint and uncov . at the edg of the tabl stood a smolder tallow-candl in an iron candlestick . it appear that the famili had a room to themselv , not part of a room , but their room wa practic a passag . the door lead to the other room , or rather cupboard , into which amalia lippevechsel ’ s flat wa divid stood half open , and there wa shout , uproar and laughter within . peopl seem to be play card and drink tea there . word of the most unceremoni kind flew out from time to time . raskolnikov recognis katerina ivanovna at onc . she wa a rather tall , slim and grace woman , terribl emaci , with magnific dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheek . she wa pace up and down in her littl room , press her hand against her chest ; her lip were parch and her breath came in nervou broken gasp . her eye glitter as in fever and look about with a harsh immov stare . and that consumpt and excit face with the last flicker light of the candle-end play upon it made a sicken impress . she seem to raskolnikov about thirti year old and wa certainli a strang wife for marmeladov .... she had not heard them and did not notic them come in . she seem to be lost in thought , hear and see noth . the room wa close , but she had not open the window ; a stench rose from the staircas , but the door on to the stair wa not close . from the inner room cloud of tobacco smoke float in , she kept cough , but did not close the door . the youngest child , a girl of six , wa asleep , sit curl up on the floor with her head on the sofa . a boy a year older stood cri and shake in the corner , probabl he had just had a beat . besid him stood a girl of nine year old , tall and thin , wear a thin and rag chemis with an ancient cashmer peliss flung over her bare shoulder , long outgrown and bare reach her knee . her arm , as thin as a stick , wa round her brother ’ s neck . she wa tri to comfort him , whisper someth to him , and do all she could to keep him from whimper again . at the same time her larg dark eye , which look larger still from the thin of her frighten face , were watch her mother with alarm . marmeladov did not enter the door , but drop on hi knee in the veri doorway , push raskolnikov in front of him . the woman see a stranger stop indiffer face him , come to herself for a moment and appar wonder what he had come for . but evid she decid that he wa go into the next room , as he had to pass through her to get there . take no further notic of him , she walk toward the outer door to close it and utter a sudden scream on see her husband on hi knee in the doorway . “ ah ! ” she cri out in a frenzi , “ he ha come back ! the crimin ! the monster ! ... and where is the money ? what ’ s in your pocket , show me ! and your cloth are all differ ! where are your cloth ? where is the money ! speak ! ” and she fell to search him . marmeladov submiss and obedi held up both arm to facilit the search . not a farth wa there . “ where is the money ? ” she cri -- “ merci on us , can he have drunk it all ? there were twelv silver roubl left in the chest ! ” and in a furi she seiz him by the hair and drag him into the room . marmeladov second her effort by meekli crawl along on hi knee . “ and thi is a consol to me ! thi doe not hurt me , but is a posit con-so-la-t , ho-nou-r sir , ” he call out , shaken to and fro by hi hair and even onc strike the ground with hi forehead . the child asleep on the floor woke up , and began to cri . the boy in the corner lose all control began trembl and scream and rush to hi sister in violent terror , almost in a fit . the eldest girl wa shake like a leaf . “ he ’ s drunk it ! he ’ s drunk it all , ” the poor woman scream in despair -- “ and hi cloth are gone ! and they are hungri , hungri ! ” -- and wring her hand she point to the children . “ oh , accurs life ! and you , are you not asham ? ” -- she pounc all at onc upon raskolnikov -- “ from the tavern ! have you been drink with him ? you have been drink with him , too ! go away ! ” the young man wa hasten away without utter a word . the inner door wa thrown wide open and inquisit face were peer in at it . coars laugh face with pipe and cigarett and head wear cap thrust themselv in at the doorway . further in could be seen figur in dress gown flung open , in costum of unseemli scanti , some of them with card in their hand . they were particularli divert , when marmeladov , drag about by hi hair , shout that it wa a consol to him . they even began to come into the room ; at last a sinist shrill outcri wa heard : thi came from amalia lippevechsel herself push her way amongst them and tri to restor order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by order her with coars abus to clear out of the room next day . as he went out , raskolnikov had time to put hi hand into hi pocket , to snatch up the copper he had receiv in exchang for hi roubl in the tavern and to lay them unnot on the window . afterward on the stair , he chang hi mind and would have gone back . “ what a stupid thing i ’ ve done , ” he thought to himself , “ they have sonia and i want it myself. ” but reflect that it would be imposs to take it back now and that in ani case he would not have taken it , he dismiss it with a wave of hi hand and went back to hi lodg . “ sonia want pomatum too , ” he said as he walk along the street , and he laugh malignantli -- “ such smart cost money .... hm ! and mayb sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day , for there is alway a risk , hunt big game ... dig for gold ... then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money . hurrah for sonia ! what a mine they ’ ve dug there ! and they ’ re make the most of it ! ye , they are make the most of it ! they ’ ve wept over it and grown use to it . man grow use to everyth , the scoundrel ! ” he sank into thought . “ and what if i am wrong , ” he cri suddenli after a moment ’ s thought . “ what if man is not realli a scoundrel , man in gener , i mean , the whole race of mankind -- then all the rest is prejudic , simpli artifici terror and there are no barrier and it ’ s all as it should be. ” chapter iii he wake up late next day after a broken sleep . but hi sleep had not refresh him ; he wake up biliou , irrit , ill-temp , and look with hatr at hi room . it wa a tini cupboard of a room about six pace in length . it had a poverty-stricken appear with it dusti yellow paper peel off the wall , and it wa so low-pitch that a man of more than averag height wa ill at eas in it and felt everi moment that he would knock hi head against the ceil . the furnitur wa in keep with the room : there were three old chair , rather ricketi ; a paint tabl in the corner on which lay a few manuscript and book ; the dust that lay thick upon them show that they had been long untouch . a big clumsi sofa occupi almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room ; it wa onc cover with chintz , but wa now in rag and serv raskolnikov as a bed . often he went to sleep on it , as he wa , without undress , without sheet , wrap in hi old student ’ s overcoat , with hi head on one littl pillow , under which he heap up all the linen he had , clean and dirti , by way of a bolster . a littl tabl stood in front of the sofa . it would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disord , but to raskolnikov in hi present state of mind thi wa posit agreeabl . he had got complet away from everyon , like a tortois in it shell , and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and look sometim into hi room made him writh with nervou irrit . he wa in the condit that overtak some monomaniac entir concentr upon one thing . hi landladi had for the last fortnight given up send him in meal , and he had not yet thought of expostul with her , though he went without hi dinner . nastasya , the cook and onli servant , wa rather pleas at the lodger ’ s mood and had entir given up sweep and do hi room , onli onc a week or so she would stray into hi room with a broom . she wake him up that day . “ get up , whi are you asleep ? ” she call to him . “ it ’ s past nine , i have brought you some tea ; will you have a cup ? i should think you ’ re fairli starv ? ” raskolnikov open hi eye , start and recognis nastasya . “ from the landladi , eh ? ” he ask , slowli and with a sickli face sit up on the sofa . “ from the landladi , inde ! ” she set befor him her own crack teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lump of sugar by the side of it . “ here , nastasya , take it pleas , ” he said , fumbl in hi pocket ( for he had slept in hi cloth ) and take out a hand of copper -- “ run and buy me a loaf . and get me a littl sausag , the cheapest , at the pork-butch ’ s. ” “ the loaf i ’ ll fetch you thi veri minut , but wouldn ’ t you rather have some cabbag soup instead of sausag ? it ’ s capit soup , yesterday ’ s . i save it for you yesterday , but you came in late . it ’ s fine soup. ” when the soup had been brought , and he had begun upon it , nastasya sat down besid him on the sofa and began chat . she wa a countri peasant-woman and a veri talk one . “ praskovya pavlovna mean to complain to the polic about you , ” she said . he scowl . “ to the polic ? what doe she want ? ” “ you don ’ t pay her money and you won ’ t turn out of the room . that ’ s what she want , to be sure. ” “ the devil , that ’ s the last straw , ” he mutter , grind hi teeth , “ no , that would not suit me ... just now . she is a fool , ” he ad aloud . “ i ’ ll go and talk to her to-day. ” “ fool she is and no mistak , just as i am . but whi , if you are so clever , do you lie here like a sack and have noth to show for it ? one time you use to go out , you say , to teach children . but whi is it you do noth now ? ” “ i am do ... ” raskolnikov began sullenli and reluctantli . “ what are you do ? ” “ work ... ” “ what sort of work ? ” “ i am think , ” he answer serious after a paus . nastasya wa overcom with a fit of laughter . she wa given to laughter and when anyth amus her , she laugh inaud , quiver and shake all over till she felt ill. “ and have you made much money by your think ? ” she manag to articul at last . “ one can ’ t go out to give lesson without boot . and i ’ m sick of it. ” “ don ’ t quarrel with your bread and butter. ” “ they pay so littl for lesson . what ’ s the use of a few copper ? ” he answer , reluctantli , as though repli to hi own thought . “ and you want to get a fortun all at onc ? ” he look at her strang . “ ye , i want a fortun , ” he answer firmli , after a brief paus . “ don ’ t be in such a hurri , you quit frighten me ! shall i get you the loaf or not ? ” “ as you please. ” “ ah , i forgot ! a letter came for you yesterday when you were out. ” “ a letter ? for me ! from whom ? ” “ i can ’ t say . i gave three copeck of my own to the postman for it . will you pay me back ? ” “ then bring it to me , for god ’ s sake , bring it , ” cri raskolnikov greatli excit -- “ good god ! ” a minut later the letter wa brought him . that wa it : from hi mother , from the provinc of r -- -- . he turn pale when he took it . it wa a long while sinc he had receiv a letter , but anoth feel also suddenli stab hi heart . “ nastasya , leav me alon , for good ’ sake ; here are your three copeck , but for good ’ sake , make hast and go ! ” the letter wa quiver in hi hand ; he did not want to open it in her presenc ; he want to be left _alone_ with thi letter . when nastasya had gone out , he lift it quickli to hi lip and kiss it ; then he gaze intent at the address , the small , slope handwrit , so dear and familiar , of the mother who had onc taught him to read and write . he delay ; he seem almost afraid of someth . at last he open it ; it wa a thick heavi letter , weigh over two ounc , two larg sheet of note paper were cover with veri small handwrit . “ my dear rodya , ” wrote hi mother -- “ it ’ s two month sinc i last had a talk with you by letter which ha distress me and even kept me awak at night , think . but i am sure you will not blame me for my inevit silenc . you know how i love you ; you are all we have to look to , dounia and i , you are our all , our one hope , our one stay . what a grief it wa to me when i heard that you had given up the univers some month ago , for want of mean to keep yourself and that you had lost your lesson and your other work ! how could i help you out of my hundr and twenti roubl a year pension ? the fifteen roubl i sent you four month ago i borrow , as you know , on secur of my pension , from vassili ivanovitch vahrushin a merchant of thi town . he is a kind-heart man and wa a friend of your father ’ s too . but have given him the right to receiv the pension , i had to wait till the debt wa paid off and that is onli just done , so that i ’ ve been unabl to send you anyth all thi time . but now , thank god , i believ i shall be abl to send you someth more and in fact we may congratul ourselv on our good fortun now , of which i hasten to inform you . in the first place , would you have guess , dear rodya , that your sister ha been live with me for the last six week and we shall not be separ in the futur . thank god , her suffer are over , but i will tell you everyth in order , so that you may know just how everyth ha happen and all that we have hitherto conceal from you . when you wrote to me two month ago that you had heard that dounia had a great deal to put up with in the svidrigaïlov ’ hous , when you wrote that and ask me to tell you all about it -- what could i write in answer to you ? if i had written the whole truth to you , i dare say you would have thrown up everyth and have come to us , even if you had to walk all the way , for i know your charact and your feel , and you would not let your sister be insult . i wa in despair myself , but what could i do ? and , besid , i did not know the whole truth myself then . what made it all so difficult wa that dounia receiv a hundr roubl in advanc when she took the place as gover in their famili , on condit of part of her salari be deduct everi month , and so it wa imposs to throw up the situat without repay the debt . thi sum ( now i can explain it all to you , my preciou rodya ) she took chiefli in order to send you sixti roubl , which you need so terribl then and which you receiv from us last year . we deceiv you then , write that thi money came from dounia ’ s save , but that wa not so , and now i tell you all about it , becaus , thank god , thing have suddenli chang for the better , and that you may know how dounia love you and what a heart she ha . at first inde mr. svidrigaïlov treat her veri rude and use to make disrespect and jeer remark at tabl .... but i don ’ t want to go into all those pain detail , so as not to worri you for noth when it is now all over . in short , in spite of the kind and gener behaviour of marfa petrovna , mr. svidrigaïlov ’ s wife , and all the rest of the household , dounia had a veri hard time , especi when mr. svidrigaïlov , relaps into hi old regiment habit , wa under the influenc of bacchu . and how do you think it wa all explain later on ? would you believ that the crazi fellow had conceiv a passion for dounia from the begin , but had conceal it under a show of rude and contempt . possibl he wa asham and horrifi himself at hi own flighti hope , consid hi year and hi be the father of a famili ; and that made him angri with dounia . and possibl , too , he hope by hi rude and sneer behaviour to hide the truth from other . but at last he lost all control and had the face to make dounia an open and shame propos , promis her all sort of induc and offer , besid , to throw up everyth and take her to anoth estat of hi , or even abroad . you can imagin all she went through ! to leav her situat at onc wa imposs not onli on account of the money debt , but also to spare the feel of marfa petrovna , whose suspicion would have been arous : and then dounia would have been the caus of a ruptur in the famili . and it would have meant a terribl scandal for dounia too ; that would have been inevit . there were variou other reason owe to which dounia could not hope to escap from that aw hous for anoth six week . you know dounia , of cours ; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she ha . dounia can endur a great deal and even in the most difficult case she ha the fortitud to maintain her firm . she did not even write to me about everyth for fear of upset me , although we were constantli in commun . it all end veri unexpectedli . marfa petrovna accident overheard her husband implor dounia in the garden , and , put quit a wrong interpret on the posit , threw the blame upon her , believ her to be the caus of it all . an aw scene took place between them on the spot in the garden ; marfa petrovna went so far as to strike dounia , refus to hear anyth and wa shout at her for a whole hour and then gave order that dounia should be pack off at onc to me in a plain peasant ’ s cart , into which they flung all her thing , her linen and her cloth , all pell-mel , without fold it up and pack it . and a heavi shower of rain came on , too , and dounia , insult and put to shame , had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen verst into town . onli think now what answer could i have sent to the letter i receiv from you two month ago and what could i have written ? i wa in despair ; i dare not write to you the truth becaus you would have been veri unhappi , mortifi and indign , and yet what could you do ? you could onli perhap ruin yourself , and , besid , dounia would not allow it ; and fill up my letter with trifl when my heart wa so full of sorrow , i could not . for a whole month the town wa full of gossip about thi scandal , and it came to such a pass that dounia and i dare not even go to church on account of the contemptu look , whisper , and even remark made aloud about us . all our acquaint avoid us , nobodi even bow to us in the street , and i learnt that some shopmen and clerk were intend to insult us in a shame way , smear the gate of our hous with pitch , so that the landlord began to tell us we must leav . all thi wa set go by marfa petrovna who manag to slander dounia and throw dirt at her in everi famili . she know everyon in the neighbourhood , and that month she wa continu come into the town , and as she is rather talk and fond of gossip about her famili affair and particularli of complain to all and each of her husband -- which is not at all right -- so in a short time she had spread her stori not onli in the town , but over the whole surround district . it made me ill , but dounia bore it better than i did , and if onli you could have seen how she endur it all and tri to comfort me and cheer me up ! she is an angel ! but by god ’ s merci , our suffer were cut short : mr. svidrigaïlov return to hi sens and repent and , probabl feel sorri for dounia , he laid befor marfa petrovna a complet and unmistak proof of dounia ’ s innoc , in the form of a letter dounia had been forc to write and give to him , befor marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden . thi letter , which remain in mr. svidrigaïlov ’ s hand after her departur , she had written to refus person explan and secret interview , for which he wa entreat her . in that letter she reproach him with great heat and indign for the base of hi behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna , remind him that he wa the father and head of a famili and tell him how infam it wa of him to torment and make unhappi a defenceless girl , unhappi enough alreadi . inde , dear rodya , the letter wa so nobli and touchingli written that i sob when i read it and to thi day i can not read it without tear . moreov , the evid of the servant , too , clear dounia ’ s reput ; they had seen and known a great deal more than mr. svidrigaïlov had himself suppos -- as inde is alway the case with servant . marfa petrovna wa complet taken aback , and ‘ again crush ’ as she said herself to us , but she wa complet convinc of dounia ’ s innoc . the veri next day , be sunday , she went straight to the cathedr , knelt down and pray with tear to our ladi to give her strength to bear thi new trial and to do her duti . then she came straight from the cathedr to us , told us the whole stori , wept bitterli and , fulli penit , she embrac dounia and besought her to forgiv her . the same morn without ani delay , she went round to all the hous in the town and everywher , shed tear , she assert in the most flatter term dounia ’ s innoc and the nobil of her feel and her behavior . what wa more , she show and read to everyon the letter in dounia ’ s own handwrit to mr. svidrigaïlov and even allow them to take copi of it -- which i must say i think wa superflu . in thi way she wa busi for sever day in drive about the whole town , becaus some peopl had taken offenc through preced have been given to other . and therefor they had to take turn , so that in everi hous she wa expect befor she arriv , and everyon knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be read the letter in such and such a place and peopl assembl for everi read of it , even mani who had heard it sever time alreadi both in their own hous and in other peopl ’ s . in my opinion a great deal , a veri great deal of all thi wa unnecessari ; but that ’ s marfa petrovna ’ s charact . anyway she succeed in complet re-establish dounia ’ s reput and the whole ignomini of thi affair rest as an indel disgrac upon her husband , as the onli person to blame , so that i realli began to feel sorri for him ; it wa realli treat the crazi fellow too harshli . dounia wa at onc ask to give lesson in sever famili , but she refus . all of a sudden everyon began to treat her with mark respect and all thi did much to bring about the event by which , one may say , our whole fortun are now transform . you must know , dear rodya , that dounia ha a suitor and that she ha alreadi consent to marri him . i hasten to tell you all about the matter , and though it ha been arrang without ask your consent , i think you will not be aggriev with me or with your sister on that account , for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decis till we heard from you . and you could not have judg all the fact without be on the spot . thi wa how it happen . he is alreadi of the rank of a counsellor , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , and is distantli relat to marfa petrovna , who ha been veri activ in bring the match about . it began with hi express through her hi desir to make our acquaint . he wa properli receiv , drank coffe with us and the veri next day he sent us a letter in which he veri courteous made an offer and beg for a speedi and decid answer . he is a veri busi man and is in a great hurri to get to petersburg , so that everi moment is preciou to him . at first , of cours , we were greatli surpris , as it had all happen so quickli and unexpectedli . we thought and talk it over the whole day . he is a well-to-do man , to be depend upon , he ha two post in the govern and ha alreadi made hi fortun . it is true that he is forty-f year old , but he is of a fairli prepossess appear and might still be thought attract by women , and he is altogeth a veri respect and present man , onli he seem a littl moros and somewhat conceit . but possibl that may onli be the impress he make at first sight . and bewar , dear rodya , when he come to petersburg , as he shortli will do , bewar of judg him too hastili and sever , as your way is , if there is anyth you do not like in him at first sight . i give you thi warn , although i feel sure that he will make a favour impress upon you . moreov , in order to understand ani man one must be deliber and care to avoid form prejudic and mistaken idea , which are veri difficult to correct and get over afterward . and pyotr petrovitch , judg by mani indic , is a thoroughli estim man . at hi first visit , inde , he told us that he wa a practic man , but still he share , as he express it , mani of the convict ‘ of our most rise gener ’ and he is an oppon of all prejudic . he said a good deal more , for he seem a littl conceit and like to be listen to , but thi is scarc a vice . i , of cours , understood veri littl of it , but dounia explain to me that , though he is not a man of great educ , he is clever and seem to be good-natur . you know your sister ’ s charact , rodya . she is a resolut , sensibl , patient and gener girl , but she ha a passion heart , as i know veri well . of cours , there is no great love either on hi side , or on her , but dounia is a clever girl and ha the heart of an angel , and will make it her duti to make her husband happi who on hi side will make her happi hi care . of that we have no good reason to doubt , though it must be admit the matter ha been arrang in great hast . besid he is a man of great prudenc and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that hi own happi will be the more secur , the happier dounia is with him . and as for some defect of charact , for some habit and even certain differ of opinion -- which inde are inevit even in the happiest marriag -- dounia ha said that , as regard all that , she reli on herself , that there is noth to be uneasi about , and that she is readi to put up with a great deal , if onli their futur relationship can be an honour and straightforward one . he struck me , for instanc , at first , as rather abrupt , but that may well come from hi be an outspoken man , and that is no doubt how it is . for instanc , at hi second visit , after he had receiv dounia ’ s consent , in the cours of convers , he declar that befor make dounia ’ s acquaint , he had made up hi mind to marri a girl of good reput , without dowri and , abov all , one who had experienc poverti , becaus , as he explain , a man ought not to be indebt to hi wife , but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor . i must add that he express it more nice and polit than i have done , for i have forgotten hi actual phrase and onli rememb the mean . and , besid , it wa obvious not said of design , but slip out in the heat of convers , so that he tri afterward to correct himself and smooth it over , but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude , and i said so afterward to dounia . but dounia wa vex , and answer that ‘ word are not deed , ’ and that , of cours , is perfectli true . dounia did not sleep all night befor she made up her mind , and , think that i wa asleep , she got out of bed and wa walk up and down the room all night ; at last she knelt down befor the ikon and pray long and fervent and in the morn she told me that she had decid . “ i have mention alreadi that pyotr petrovitch is just set off for petersburg , where he ha a great deal of busi , and he want to open a legal bureau . he ha been occupi for mani year in conduct civil and commerci litig , and onli the other day he won an import case . he ha to be in petersburg becaus he ha an import case befor the senat . so , rodya dear , he may be of the greatest use to you , in everi way inde , and dounia and i have agre that from thi veri day you could definit enter upon your career and might consid that your futur is mark out and assur for you . oh , if onli thi come to pass ! thi would be such a benefit that we could onli look upon it as a providenti bless . dounia is dream of noth els . we have even ventur alreadi to drop a few word on the subject to pyotr petrovitch . he wa cautiou in hi answer , and said that , of cours , as he could not get on without a secretari , it would be better to be pay a salari to a relat than to a stranger , if onli the former were fit for the duti ( as though there could be doubt of your be fit ! ) but then he express doubt whether your studi at the univers would leav you time for work at hi offic . the matter drop for the time , but dounia is think of noth els now . she ha been in a sort of fever for the last few day , and ha alreadi made a regular plan for your becom in the end an associ and even a partner in pyotr petrovitch ’ s busi , which might well be , see that you are a student of law . i am in complet agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plan and hope , and think there is everi probabl of realis them . and in spite of pyotr petrovitch ’ s evas , veri natur at present ( sinc he doe not know you ) , dounia is firmli persuad that she will gain everyth by her good influenc over her futur husband ; thi she is reckon upon . of cours we are care not to talk of ani of these more remot plan to pyotr petrovitch , especi of your becom hi partner . he is a practic man and might take thi veri coldli , it might all seem to him simpli a day-dream . nor ha either dounia or i breath a word to him of the great hope we have of hi help us to pay for your univers studi ; we have not spoken of it in the first place , becaus it will come to pass of itself , later on , and he will no doubt without wast word offer to do it of himself , ( as though he could refus dounia that ) the more readili sinc you may by your own effort becom hi right hand in the offic , and receiv thi assist not as a chariti , but as a salari earn by your own work . dounia want to arrang it all like thi and i quit agre with her . and we have not spoken of our plan for anoth reason , that is , becaus i particularli want you to feel on an equal foot when you first meet him . when dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you , he answer that one could never judg of a man without see him close , for oneself , and that he look forward to form hi own opinion when he make your acquaint . do you know , my preciou rodya , i think that perhap for some reason ( noth to do with pyotr petrovitch though , simpli for my own person , perhap old-womanish , fanci ) i should do better to go on live by myself , apart , than with them , after the wed . i am convinc that he will be gener and delic enough to invit me and to urg me to remain with my daughter for the futur , and if he ha said noth about it hitherto , it is simpli becaus it ha been taken for grant ; but i shall refus . i have notic more than onc in my life that husband don ’ t quit get on with their mothers-in-law , and i don ’ t want to be the least bit in anyon ’ s way , and for my own sake , too , would rather be quit independ , so long as i have a crust of bread of my own , and such children as you and dounia . if possibl , i would settl somewher near you , for the most joy piec of news , dear rodya , i have kept for the end of my letter : know then , my dear boy , that we may , perhap , be all togeth in a veri short time and may embrac one anoth again after a separ of almost three year ! it is settl _for certain_ that dounia and i are to set off for petersburg , exactli when i don ’ t know , but veri , veri soon , possibl in a week . it all depend on pyotr petrovitch who will let us know when he ha had time to look round him in petersburg . to suit hi own arrang he is anxiou to have the ceremoni as soon as possibl , even befor the fast of our ladi , if it could be manag , or if that is too soon to be readi , immedi after . oh , with what happi i shall press you to my heart ! dounia is all excit at the joy thought of see you , she said one day in joke that she would be readi to marri pyotr petrovitch for that alon . she is an angel ! she is not write anyth to you now , and ha onli told me to write that she ha so much , so much to tell you that she is not go to take up her pen now , for a few line would tell you noth , and it would onli mean upset herself ; she bid me send you her love and innumer kiss . but although we shall be meet so soon , perhap i shall send you as much money as i can in a day or two . now that everyon ha heard that dounia is to marri pyotr petrovitch , my credit ha suddenli improv and i know that afanasi ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-f roubl on the secur of my pension , so that perhap i shall be abl to send you twenty-f or even thirti roubl . i would send you more , but i am uneasi about our travel expens ; for though pyotr petrovitch ha been so kind as to undertak part of the expens of the journey , that is to say , he ha taken upon himself the convey of our bag and big trunk ( which will be convey through some acquaint of hi ) , we must reckon upon some expens on our arriv in petersburg , where we can ’ t be left without a halfpenni , at least for the first few day . but we have calcul it all , dounia and i , to the last penni , and we see that the journey will not cost veri much . it is onli nineti verst from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know , so as to be in readi ; and from there dounia and i can travel quit comfort third class . so that i may veri like be abl to send to you not twenty-f , but thirti roubl . but enough ; i have cover two sheet alreadi and there is no space left for more ; our whole histori , but so mani event have happen ! and now , my preciou rodya , i embrac you and send you a mother ’ s bless till we meet . love dounia your sister , rodya ; love her as she love you and understand that she love you beyond everyth , more than herself . she is an angel and you , rodya , you are everyth to us -- our one hope , our one consol . if onli you are happi , we shall be happi . do you still say your prayer , rodya , and believ in the merci of our creator and our redeem ? i am afraid in my heart that you may have been visit by the new spirit of infidel that is abroad to-day ; if it is so , i pray for you . rememb , dear boy , how in your childhood , when your father wa live , you use to lisp your prayer at my knee , and how happi we all were in those day . good-by , till we meet then -- i embrac you warmli , warmli , with mani kiss . “ your till death , “ pulcheria raskolnikov. ” almost from the first , while he read the letter , raskolnikov ’ s face wa wet with tear ; but when he finish it , hi face wa pale and distort and a bitter , wrath and malign smile wa on hi lip . he laid hi head down on hi threadbar dirti pillow and ponder , ponder a long time . hi heart wa beat violent , and hi brain wa in a turmoil . at last he felt cramp and stifl in the littl yellow room that wa like a cupboard or a box . hi eye and hi mind crave for space . he took up hi hat and went out , thi time without dread of meet anyon ; he had forgotten hi dread . he turn in the direct of the vassilyevski ostrov , walk along vassilyevski prospect , as though hasten on some busi , but he walk , as hi habit wa , without notic hi way , mutter and even speak aloud to himself , to the astonish of the passers-bi . mani of them took him to be drunk . chapter iv hi mother ’ s letter had been a tortur to him , but as regard the chief fact in it , he had felt not one moment ’ s hesit , even whilst he wa read the letter . the essenti question wa settl , and irrevoc settl , in hi mind : “ never such a marriag while i am aliv and mr. luzhin be damn ! ” “ the thing is perfectli clear , ” he mutter to himself , with a malign smile anticip the triumph of hi decis . “ no , mother , no , dounia , you won ’ t deceiv me ! and then they apologis for not ask my advic and for take the decis without me ! i dare say ! they imagin it is arrang now and can ’ t be broken off ; but we will see whether it can or not ! a magnific excus : ‘ pyotr petrovitch is such a busi man that even hi wed ha to be in post-hast , almost by express. ’ no , dounia , i see it all and i know what you want to say to me ; and i know too what you were think about , when you walk up and down all night , and what your prayer were like befor the holi mother of kazan who stand in mother ’ s bedroom . bitter is the ascent to golgotha .... hm ... so it is final settl ; you have determin to marri a sensibl busi man , avdotya romanovna , one who ha a fortun ( ha _already_ made hi fortun , that is so much more solid and impress ) , a man who hold two govern post and who share the idea of our most rise gener , as mother write , and who _seems_ to be kind , as dounia herself observ . that _seems_ beat everyth ! and that veri dounia for that veri ‘ _seems_ ’ is marri him ! splendid ! splendid ! “ ... but i should like to know whi mother ha written to me about ‘ our most rise gener ’ ? simpli as a descript touch , or with the idea of prepossess me in favour of mr. luzhin ? oh , the cun of them ! i should like to know one thing more : how far they were open with one anoth that day and night and all thi time sinc ? wa it all put into _words_ , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their mind , so that there wa no need to speak of it aloud , and better not to speak of it . most like it wa partli like that , from mother ’ s letter it ’ s evid : he struck her as rude _a little_ , and mother in her simplic took her observ to dounia . and she wa sure to be vex and ‘ answer her angrily. ’ i should think so ! who would not be anger when it wa quit clear without ani naïv question and when it wa understood that it wa useless to discuss it . and whi doe she write to me , ‘ love dounia , rodya , and she love you more than herself ’ ? ha she a secret conscience-prick at sacrif her daughter to her son ? ‘ you are our one comfort , you are everyth to us. ’ oh , mother ! ” hi bitter grew more and more intens , and if he had happen to meet mr. luzhin at the moment , he might have murder him . “ hm ... ye , that ’ s true , ” he continu , pursu the whirl idea that chase each other in hi brain , “ it is true that ‘ it need time and care to get to know a man , ’ but there is no mistak about mr. luzhin . the chief thing is he is ‘ a man of busi and _seems_ kind , ’ that wa someth , wasn ’ t it , to send the bag and big box for them ! a kind man , no doubt after that ! but hi _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a peasant ’ s cart cover with sack ( i know , i have been driven in it ) . no matter ! it is onli nineti verst and then they can ‘ travel veri comfort , third class , ’ for a thousand verst ! quit right , too . one must cut one ’ s coat accord to one ’ s cloth , but what about you , mr. luzhin ? she is your bride .... and you must be awar that her mother ha to rais money on her pension for the journey . to be sure it ’ s a matter of busi , a partnership for mutual benefit , with equal share and expens ; -- food and drink provid , but pay for your tobacco . the busi man ha got the better of them , too . the luggag will cost less than their fare and veri like go for noth . how is it that they don ’ t both see all that , or is it that they don ’ t want to see ? and they are pleas , pleas ! and to think that thi is onli the first blossom , and that the real fruit are to come ! but what realli matter is not the stingi , is not the mean , but the _tone_ of the whole thing . for that will be the tone after marriag , it ’ s a foretast of it . and mother too , whi should she be so lavish ? what will she have by the time she get to petersburg ? three silver roubl or two ‘ paper one ’ as _she_ say .... that old woman ... hm . what doe she expect to live upon in petersburg afterward ? she ha her reason alreadi for guess that she _could not_ live with dounia after the marriag , even for the first few month . the good man ha no doubt let slip someth on that subject also , though mother would deni it : ‘ i shall refus , ’ say she . on whom is she reckon then ? is she count on what is left of her hundr and twenti roubl of pension when afanasi ivanovitch ’ s debt is paid ? she knit woollen shawl and embroid cuff , ruin her old eye . and all her shawl don ’ t add more than twenti roubl a year to her hundr and twenti , i know that . so she is build all her hope all the time on mr. luzhin ’ s generos ; ‘ he will offer it of himself , he will press it on me. ’ you may wait a long time for that ! that ’ s how it alway is with these schilleresqu nobl heart ; till the last moment everi goos is a swan with them , till the last moment , they hope for the best and will see noth wrong , and although they have an inkl of the other side of the pictur , yet they won ’ t face the truth till they are forc to ; the veri thought of it make them shiver ; they thrust the truth away with both hand , until the man they deck out in fals colour put a fool ’ s cap on them with hi own hand . i should like to know whether mr. luzhin ha ani order of merit ; i bet he ha the anna in hi buttonhol and that he put it on when he goe to dine with contractor or merchant . he will be sure to have it for hi wed , too ! enough of him , confound him ! “ well , ... mother i don ’ t wonder at , it ’ s like her , god bless her , but how could dounia ? dounia darl , as though i did not know you ! you were nearli twenti when i saw you last : i understood you then . mother write that ‘ dounia can put up with a great deal. ’ i know that veri well . i knew that two year and a half ago , and for the last two and a half year i have been think about it , think of just that , that ‘ dounia can put up with a great deal. ’ if she could put up with mr. svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it , she certainli can put up with a great deal . and now mother and she have taken it into their head that she can put up with mr. luzhin , who propound the theori of the superior of wive rais from destitut and owe everyth to their husband ’ s bounti -- who propound it , too , almost at the first interview . grant that he ‘ let it slip , ’ though he is a sensibl man , ( yet mayb it wa not a slip at all , but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possibl ) but dounia , dounia ? she understand the man , of cours , but she will have to live with the man . whi ! she ’ d live on black bread and water , she would not sell her soul , she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort ; she would not barter it for all schleswig-holstein , much less mr. luzhin ’ s money . no , dounia wa not that sort when i knew her and ... she is still the same , of cours ! ye , there ’ s no deni , the svidrigaïlov are a bitter pill ! it ’ s a bitter thing to spend one ’ s life a gover in the provinc for two hundr roubl , but i know she would rather be a nigger on a plantat or a lett with a german master than degrad her soul , and her moral digniti , by bind herself for ever to a man whom she doe not respect and with whom she ha noth in common -- for her own advantag . and if mr. luzhin had been of unalloy gold , or one huge diamond , she would never have consent to becom hi legal concubin . whi is she consent then ? what ’ s the point of it ? what ’ s the answer ? it ’ s clear enough : for herself , for her comfort , to save her life she would not sell herself , but for someon els she is do it ! for one she love , for one she ador , she will sell herself ! that ’ s what it all amount to ; for her brother , for her mother , she will sell herself ! she will sell everyth ! in such case , ‘ we overcom our moral feel if necessari , ’ freedom , peac , conscienc even , all , all are brought into the market . let my life go , if onli my dear one may be happi ! more than that , we becom casuist , we learn to be jesuit and for a time mayb we can sooth ourselv , we can persuad ourselv that it is one ’ s duti for a good object . that ’ s just like us , it ’ s as clear as daylight . it ’ s clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figur in the busi , and no one els . oh , ye , she can ensur hi happi , keep him in the univers , make him a partner in the offic , make hi whole futur secur ; perhap he may even be a rich man later on , prosper , respect , and may even end hi life a famou man ! but my mother ? it ’ s all rodya , preciou rodya , her first born ! for such a son who would not sacrific such a daughter ! oh , love , over-parti heart ! whi , for hi sake we would not shrink even from sonia ’ s fate . sonia , sonia marmeladov , the etern victim so long as the world last . have you taken the measur of your sacrific , both of you ? is it right ? can you bear it ? is it ani use ? is there sens in it ? and let me tell you , dounia , sonia ’ s life is no wors than life with mr. luzhin . ‘ there can be no question of love , ’ mother write . and what if there can be no respect either , if on the contrari there is avers , contempt , repuls , what then ? so you will have to ‘ keep up your appear , ’ too . is not that so ? do you understand what that smart mean ? do you understand that the luzhin smart is just the same thing as sonia ’ s and may be wors , viler , baser , becaus in your case , dounia , it ’ s a bargain for luxuri , after all , but with sonia it ’ s simpli a question of starvat . it ha to be paid for , it ha to be paid for , dounia , thi smart . and what if it ’ s more than you can bear afterward , if you regret it ? the bitter , the miseri , the curs , the tear hidden from all the world , for you are not a marfa petrovna . and how will your mother feel then ? even now she is uneasi , she is worri , but then , when she see it all clearli ? and i ? ye , inde , what have you taken me for ? i won ’ t have your sacrific , dounia , i won ’ t have it , mother ! it shall not be , so long as i am aliv , it shall not , it shall not ! i won ’ t accept it ! ” he suddenli paus in hi reflect and stood still . “ it shall not be ? but what are you go to do to prevent it ? you ’ ll forbid it ? and what right have you ? what can you promis them on your side to give you such a right ? your whole life , your whole futur , you will devot to them _when you have finish your studi and obtain a post_ ? ye , we have heard all that befor , and that ’ s all _words_ , but now ? now someth must be done , now , do you understand that ? and what are you do now ? you are live upon them . they borrow on their hundr roubl pension . they borrow from the svidrigaïlov . how are you go to save them from svidrigaïlov , from afanasi ivanovitch vahrushin , oh , futur millionair zeu who would arrang their live for them ? in anoth ten year ? in anoth ten year , mother will be blind with knit shawl , mayb with weep too . she will be worn to a shadow with fast ; and my sister ? imagin for a moment what may have becom of your sister in ten year ? what may happen to her dure those ten year ? can you fanci ? ” so he tortur himself , fret himself with such question , and find a kind of enjoy in it . and yet all these question were not new one suddenli confront him , they were old familiar ach . it wa long sinc they had first begun to grip and rend hi heart . long , long ago hi present anguish had it first begin ; it had wax and gather strength , it had matur and concentr , until it had taken the form of a fear , frenzi and fantast question , which tortur hi heart and mind , clamour insist for an answer . now hi mother ’ s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap . it wa clear that he must not now suffer passiv , worri himself over unsolv question , but that he must do someth , do it at onc , and do it quickli . anyway he must decid on someth , or els ... “ or throw up life altogeth ! ” he cri suddenli , in a frenzi -- “ accept one ’ s lot humbl as it is , onc for all and stifl everyth in oneself , give up all claim to activ , life and love ! ” “ do you understand , sir , do you understand what it mean when you have absolut nowher to turn ? ” marmeladov ’ s question came suddenli into hi mind , “ for everi man must have somewher to turn .... ” he gave a sudden start ; anoth thought , that he had had yesterday , slip back into hi mind . but he did not start at the thought recur to him , for he knew , he had _felt beforehand_ , that it must come back , he wa expect it ; besid it wa not onli yesterday ’ s thought . the differ wa that a month ago , yesterday even , the thought wa a mere dream : but now ... now it appear not a dream at all , it had taken a new menac and quit unfamiliar shape , and he suddenli becam awar of thi himself .... he felt a hammer in hi head , and there wa a dark befor hi eye . he look round hurriedli , he wa search for someth . he want to sit down and wa look for a seat ; he wa walk along the k -- -- boulevard . there wa a seat about a hundr pace in front of him . he walk toward it as fast he could ; but on the way he met with a littl adventur which absorb all hi attent . look for the seat , he had notic a woman walk some twenti pace in front of him , but at first he took no more notic of her than of other object that cross hi path . it had happen to him mani time go home not to notic the road by which he wa go , and he wa accustom to walk like that . but there wa at first sight someth so strang about the woman in front of him , that gradual hi attent wa rivet upon her , at first reluctantli and , as it were , resent , and then more and more intent . he felt a sudden desir to find out what it wa that wa so strang about the woman . in the first place , she appear to be a girl quit young , and she wa walk in the great heat barehead and with no parasol or glove , wave her arm about in an absurd way . she had on a dress of some light silki materi , but put on strang awri , not properli hook up , and torn open at the top of the skirt , close to the waist : a great piec wa rent and hang loos . a littl kerchief wa flung about her bare throat , but lay slant on one side . the girl wa walk unsteadili , too , stumbl and stagger from side to side . she drew raskolnikov ’ s whole attent at last . he overtook the girl at the seat , but , on reach it , she drop down on it , in the corner ; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and close her eye , appar in extrem exhaust . look at her close , he saw at onc that she wa complet drunk . it wa a strang and shock sight . he could hardli believ that he wa not mistaken . he saw befor him the face of a quit young , fair-hair girl -- sixteen , perhap not more than fifteen , year old , pretti littl face , but flush and heavi look and , as it were , swollen . the girl seem hardli to know what she wa do ; she cross one leg over the other , lift it indecor , and show everi sign of be unconsci that she wa in the street . raskolnikov did not sit down , but he felt unwil to leav her , and stood face her in perplex . thi boulevard wa never much frequent ; and now , at two o ’ clock , in the stifl heat , it wa quit desert . and yet on the further side of the boulevard , about fifteen pace away , a gentleman wa stand on the edg of the pavement . he , too , would appar have like to approach the girl with some object of hi own . he , too , had probabl seen her in the distanc and had follow her , but found raskolnikov in hi way . he look angrili at him , though he tri to escap hi notic , and stood impati bide hi time , till the unwelcom man in rag should have move away . hi intent were unmistak . the gentleman wa a plump , thickly-set man , about thirti , fashion dress , with a high colour , red lip and moustach . raskolnikov felt furiou ; he had a sudden long to insult thi fat dandi in some way . he left the girl for a moment and walk toward the gentleman . “ hey ! you svidrigaïlov ! what do you want here ? ” he shout , clench hi fist and laugh , splutter with rage . “ what do you mean ? ” the gentleman ask sternli , scowl in haughti astonish . “ get away , that ’ s what i mean. ” “ how dare you , you low fellow ! ” he rais hi cane . raskolnikov rush at him with hi fist , without reflect that the stout gentleman wa a match for two men like himself . but at that instant someon seiz him from behind , and a polic constabl stood between them . “ that ’ s enough , gentlemen , no fight , pleas , in a public place . what do you want ? who are you ? ” he ask raskolnikov sternli , notic hi rag . raskolnikov look at him intent . he had a straight-forward , sensibl , soldierli face , with grey moustach and whisker . “ you are just the man i want , ” raskolnikov cri , catch at hi arm . “ i am a student , raskolnikov .... you may as well know that too , ” he ad , address the gentleman , “ come along , i have someth to show you. ” and take the policeman by the hand he drew him toward the seat . “ look here , hopelessli drunk , and she ha just come down the boulevard . there is no tell who and what she is , she doe not look like a profession . it ’ s more like she ha been given drink and deceiv somewher ... for the first time ... you understand ? and they ’ ve put her out into the street like that . look at the way her dress is torn , and the way it ha been put on : she ha been dress by somebodi , she ha not dress herself , and dress by unpractis hand , by a man ’ s hand ; that ’ s evid . and now look there : i don ’ t know that dandi with whom i wa go to fight , i see him for the first time , but he , too , ha seen her on the road , just now , drunk , not know what she is do , and now he is veri eager to get hold of her , to get her away somewher while she is in thi state ... that ’ s certain , believ me , i am not wrong . i saw him myself watch her and follow her , but i prevent him , and he is just wait for me to go away . now he ha walk away a littl , and is stand still , pretend to make a cigarett .... think how can we keep her out of hi hand , and how are we to get her home ? ” the policeman saw it all in a flash . the stout gentleman wa easi to understand , he turn to consid the girl . the policeman bent over to examin her more close , and hi face work with genuin compass . “ ah , what a piti ! ” he said , shake hi head -- “ whi , she is quit a child ! she ha been deceiv , you can see that at onc . listen , ladi , ” he began address her , “ where do you live ? ” the girl open her weari and sleepy-look eye , gaze blankli at the speaker and wave her hand . “ here , ” said raskolnikov feel in hi pocket and find twenti copeck , “ here , call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address . the onli thing is to find out her address ! ” “ missi , missi ! ” the policeman began again , take the money . “ i ’ ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself . where shall i take you , eh ? where do you live ? ” “ go away ! they won ’ t let me alon , ” the girl mutter , and onc more wave her hand . “ ach , ach , how shock ! it ’ s shame , missi , it ’ s a shame ! ” he shook hi head again , shock , sympathet and indign . “ it ’ s a difficult job , ” the policeman said to raskolnikov , and as he did so , he look him up and down in a rapid glanc . he , too , must have seem a strang figur to him : dress in rag and hand him money ! “ did you meet her far from here ? ” he ask him . “ i tell you she wa walk in front of me , stagger , just here , in the boulevard . she onli just reach the seat and sank down on it. ” “ ah , the shame thing that are done in the world nowaday , god have merci on us ! an innoc creatur like that , drunk alreadi ! she ha been deceiv , that ’ s a sure thing . see how her dress ha been torn too .... ah , the vice one see nowaday ! and as like as not she belong to gentlefolk too , poor one mayb .... there are mani like that nowaday . she look refin , too , as though she were a ladi , ” and he bent over her onc more . perhap he had daughter grow up like that , “ look like ladi and refin ” with pretens to gentil and smart .... “ the chief thing is , ” raskolnikov persist , “ to keep her out of thi scoundrel ’ s hand ! whi should he outrag her ! it ’ s as clear as day what he is after ; ah , the brute , he is not move off ! ” raskolnikov spoke aloud and point to him . the gentleman heard him , and seem about to fli into a rage again , but thought better of it , and confin himself to a contemptu look . he then walk slowli anoth ten pace away and again halt . “ keep her out of hi hand we can , ” said the constabl thought , “ if onli she ’ d tell us where to take her , but as it is .... missi , hey , missi ! ” he bent over her onc more . she open her eye fulli all of a sudden , look at him intent , as though realis someth , got up from the seat and walk away in the direct from which she had come . “ oh shame wretch , they won ’ t let me alon ! ” she said , wave her hand again . she walk quickli , though stagger as befor . the dandi follow her , but along anoth avenu , keep hi eye on her . “ don ’ t be anxiou , i won ’ t let him have her , ” the policeman said resolut , and he set off after them . “ ah , the vice one see nowaday ! ” he repeat aloud , sigh . at that moment someth seem to sting raskolnikov ; in an instant a complet revuls of feel came over him . “ hey , here ! ” he shout after the policeman . the latter turn round . “ let them be ! what is it to do with you ? let her go ! let him amus himself. ” he point at the dandi , “ what is it to do with you ? ” the policeman wa bewild , and stare at him open-ey . raskolnikov laugh . “ well ! ” ejacul the policeman , with a gestur of contempt , and he walk after the dandi and the girl , probabl take raskolnikov for a madman or someth even wors . “ he ha carri off my twenti copeck , ” raskolnikov murmur angrili when he wa left alon . “ well , let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end . and whi did i want to interfer ? is it for me to help ? have i ani right to help ? let them devour each other aliv -- what is it to me ? how did i dare to give him twenti copeck ? were they mine ? ” in spite of those strang word he felt veri wretch . he sat down on the desert seat . hi thought stray aimlessli .... he found it hard to fix hi mind on anyth at that moment . he long to forget himself altogeth , to forget everyth , and then to wake up and begin life anew .... “ poor girl ! ” he said , look at the empti corner where she had sat -- “ she will come to herself and weep , and then her mother will find out .... she will give her a beat , a horribl , shame beat and then mayb , turn her out of door .... and even if she doe not , the darya frantsovna will get wind of it , and the girl will soon be slip out on the sli here and there . then there will be the hospit directli ( that ’ s alway the luck of those girl with respect mother , who go wrong on the sli ) and then ... again the hospit ... drink ... the tavern ... and more hospit , in two or three year -- a wreck , and her life over at eighteen or nineteen .... have not i seen case like that ? and how have they been brought to it ? whi , they ’ ve all come to it like that . ugh ! but what doe it matter ? that ’ s as it should be , they tell us . a certain percentag , they tell us , must everi year go ... that way ... to the devil , i suppos , so that the rest may remain chast , and not be interf with . a percentag ! what splendid word they have ; they are so scientif , so consolatori .... onc you ’ ve said ‘ percentag ’ there ’ s noth more to worri about . if we had ani other word ... mayb we might feel more uneasi .... but what if dounia were one of the percentag ! of anoth one if not that one ? “ but where am i go ? ” he thought suddenli . “ strang , i came out for someth . as soon as i had read the letter i came out .... i wa go to vassilyevski ostrov , to razumihin . that ’ s what it wa ... now i rememb . what for , though ? and what put the idea of go to razumihin into my head just now ? that ’ s curious. ” he wonder at himself . razumihin wa one of hi old comrad at the univers . it wa remark that raskolnikov had hardli ani friend at the univers ; he kept aloof from everyon , went to see no one , and did not welcom anyon who came to see him , and inde everyon soon gave him up . he took no part in the student ’ gather , amus or convers . he work with great intens without spare himself , and he wa respect for thi , but no one like him . he wa veri poor , and there wa a sort of haughti pride and reserv about him , as though he were keep someth to himself . he seem to some of hi comrad to look down upon them all as children , as though he were superior in develop , knowledg and convict , as though their belief and interest were beneath him . with razumihin he had got on , or , at least , he wa more unreserv and commun with him . inde it wa imposs to be on ani other term with razumihin . he wa an except good-humour and candid youth , good-natur to the point of simplic , though both depth and digniti lay conceal under that simplic . the better of hi comrad understood thi , and all were fond of him . he wa extrem intellig , though he wa certainli rather a simpleton at time . he wa of strike appear -- tall , thin , blackhair and alway badli shave . he wa sometim uproari and wa reput to be of great physic strength . one night , when out in a festiv compani , he had with one blow laid a gigant policeman on hi back . there wa no limit to hi drink power , but he could abstain from drink altogeth ; he sometim went too far in hi prank ; but he could do without prank altogeth . anoth thing strike about razumihin , no failur distress him , and it seem as though no unfavour circumst could crush him . he could lodg anywher , and bear the extrem of cold and hunger . he wa veri poor , and kept himself entir on what he could earn by work of one sort or anoth . he knew of no end of resourc by which to earn money . he spent one whole winter without light hi stove , and use to declar that he like it better , becaus one slept more soundli in the cold . for the present he , too , had been oblig to give up the univers , but it wa onli for a time , and he wa work with all hi might to save enough to return to hi studi again . raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four month , and razumihin did not even know hi address . about two month befor , they had met in the street , but raskolnikov had turn away and even cross to the other side that he might not be observ . and though razumihin notic him , he pass him by , as he did not want to annoy him . chapter v “ of cours , i ’ ve been mean late to go to razumihin ’ s to ask for work , to ask him to get me lesson or someth ... ” raskolnikov thought , “ but what help can he be to me now ? suppos he get me lesson , suppos he share hi last farth with me , if he ha ani farth , so that i could get some boot and make myself tidi enough to give lesson ... hm ... well and what then ? what shall i do with the few copper i earn ? that ’ s not what i want now . it ’ s realli absurd for me to go to razumihin .... ” the question whi he wa now go to razumihin agit him even more than he wa himself awar ; he kept uneasili seek for some sinist signific in thi appar ordinari action . “ could i have expect to set it all straight and to find a way out by mean of razumihin alon ? ” he ask himself in perplex . he ponder and rub hi forehead , and , strang to say , after long muse , suddenli , as if it were spontan and by chanc , a fantast thought came into hi head . “ hm ... to razumihin ’ s , ” he said all at onc , calmli , as though he had reach a final determin . “ i shall go to razumihin ’ s of cours , but ... not now . i shall go to him ... on the next day after it , when it will be over and everyth will begin afresh .... ” and suddenli he realis what he wa think . “ after it , ” he shout , jump up from the seat , “ but is it realli go to happen ? is it possibl it realli will happen ? ” he left the seat , and went off almost at a run ; he meant to turn back , homeward , but the thought of go home suddenli fill him with intens loath ; in that hole , in that aw littl cupboard of hi , all _this_ had for a month past been grow up in him ; and he walk on at random . hi nervou shudder had pass into a fever that made him feel shiver ; in spite of the heat he felt cold . with a kind of effort he began almost unconsci , from some inner crave , to stare at all the object befor him , as though look for someth to distract hi attent ; but he did not succeed , and kept drop everi moment into brood . when with a start he lift hi head again and look round , he forgot at onc what he had just been think about and even where he wa go . in thi way he walk right across vassilyevski ostrov , came out on to the lesser neva , cross the bridg and turn toward the island . the green and fresh were at first rest to hi weari eye after the dust of the town and the huge hous that hem him in and weigh upon him . here there were no tavern , no stifl close , no stench . but soon these new pleasant sensat pass into morbid irrit . sometim he stood still befor a brightli paint summer villa stand among green foliag , he gaze through the fenc , he saw in the distanc smartli dress women on the verandah and balconi , and children run in the garden . the flower especi caught hi attent ; he gaze at them longer than at anyth . he wa met , too , by luxuri carriag and by men and women on horseback ; he watch them with curiou eye and forgot about them befor they had vanish from hi sight . onc he stood still and count hi money ; he found he had thirti copeck . “ twenti to the policeman , three to nastasya for the letter , so i must have given forty-seven or fifti to the marmeladov yesterday , ” he thought , reckon it up for some unknown reason , but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of hi pocket . he recal it on pass an eating-hous or tavern , and felt that he wa hungri .... go into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort . he finish eat it as he walk away . it wa a long while sinc he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at onc , though he onli drank a wineglass . hi leg felt suddenli heavi and a great drowsi came upon him . he turn homeward , but reach petrovski ostrov he stop complet exhaust , turn off the road into the bush , sank down upon the grass and instantli fell asleep . in a morbid condit of the brain , dream often have a singular actual , vivid , and extraordinari semblanc of realiti . at time monstrou imag are creat , but the set and the whole pictur are so truth-lik and fill with detail so delic , so unexpectedli , but so artist consist , that the dreamer , were he an artist like pushkin or turgenev even , could never have invent them in the wake state . such sick dream alway remain long in the memori and make a power impress on the overwrought and derang nervou system . raskolnikov had a fear dream . he dreamt he wa back in hi childhood in the littl town of hi birth . he wa a child about seven year old , walk into the countri with hi father on the even of a holiday . it wa a grey and heavi day , the countri wa exactli as he rememb it ; inde he recal it far more vividli in hi dream than he had done in memori . the littl town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand , not even a willow near it ; onli in the far distanc , a cops lay , a dark blur on the veri edg of the horizon . a few pace beyond the last market garden stood a tavern , a big tavern , which had alway arous in him a feel of avers , even of fear , when he walk by it with hi father . there wa alway a crowd there , alway shout , laughter and abus , hideou hoars sing and often fight . drunken and horrible-look figur were hang about the tavern . he use to cling close to hi father , trembl all over when he met them . near the tavern the road becam a dusti track , the dust of which wa alway black . it wa a wind road , and about a hundr pace further on , it turn to the right to the graveyard . in the middl of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he use to go to mass two or three time a year with hi father and mother , when a servic wa held in memori of hi grandmoth , who had long been dead , and whom he had never seen . on these occas they use to take on a white dish tie up in a tabl napkin a special sort of rice pud with raisin stuck in it in the shape of a cross . he love that church , the old-fashion , unadorn ikon and the old priest with the shake head . near hi grandmoth ’ s grave , which wa mark by a stone , wa the littl grave of hi younger brother who had die at six month old . he did not rememb him at all , but he had been told about hi littl brother , and whenev he visit the graveyard he use religi and rever to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the littl grave . and now he dreamt that he wa walk with hi father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard ; he wa hold hi father ’ s hand and look with dread at the tavern . a peculiar circumst attract hi attent : there seem to be some kind of festiv go on , there were crowd of gaili dress townspeopl , peasant women , their husband , and riff-raff of all sort , all sing and all more or less drunk . near the entranc of the tavern stood a cart , but a strang cart . it wa one of those big cart usual drawn by heavi cart-hors and laden with cask of wine or other heavi good . he alway like look at those great cart-hors , with their long mane , thick leg , and slow even pace , draw along a perfect mountain with no appear of effort , as though it were easier go with a load than without it . but now , strang to say , in the shaft of such a cart he saw a thin littl sorrel beast , one of those peasant ’ nag which he had often seen strain their utmost under a heavi load of wood or hay , especi when the wheel were stuck in the mud or in a rut . and the peasant would beat them so cruelli , sometim even about the nose and eye , and he felt so sorri , so sorri for them that he almost cri , and hi mother alway use to take him away from the window . all of a sudden there wa a great uproar of shout , sing and the balalaïka , and from the tavern a number of big and veri drunken peasant came out , wear red and blue shirt and coat thrown over their shoulder . “ get in , get in ! ” shout one of them , a young thick-neck peasant with a fleshi face red as a carrot . “ i ’ ll take you all , get in ! ” but at onc there wa an outbreak of laughter and exclam in the crowd . “ take us all with a beast like that ! ” “ whi , mikolka , are you crazi to put a nag like that in such a cart ? ” “ and thi mare is twenti if she is a day , mate ! ” “ get in , i ’ ll take you all , ” mikolka shout again , leap first into the cart , seiz the rein and stand straight up in front . “ the bay ha gone with matvey , ” he shout from the cart -- “ and thi brute , mate , is just break my heart , i feel as if i could kill her . she ’ s just eat her head off . get in , i tell you ! i ’ ll make her gallop ! she ’ ll gallop ! ” and he pick up the whip , prepar himself with relish to flog the littl mare . “ get in ! come along ! ” the crowd laugh . “ d ’ you hear , she ’ ll gallop ! ” “ gallop inde ! she ha not had a gallop in her for the last ten year ! ” “ she ’ ll jog along ! ” “ don ’ t you mind her , mate , bring a whip each of you , get readi ! ” “ all right ! give it to her ! ” they all clamber into mikolka ’ s cart , laugh and make joke . six men got in and there wa still room for more . they haul in a fat , rosy-cheek woman . she wa dress in red cotton , in a point , bead headdress and thick leather shoe ; she wa crack nut and laugh . the crowd round them wa laugh too and inde , how could they help laugh ? that wretch nag wa to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop ! two young fellow in the cart were just get whip readi to help mikolka . with the cri of “ now , ” the mare tug with all her might , but far from gallop , could scarc move forward ; she struggl with her leg , gasp and shrink from the blow of the three whip which were shower upon her like hail . the laughter in the cart and in the crowd wa redoubl , but mikolka flew into a rage and furious thrash the mare , as though he suppos she realli could gallop . “ let me get in , too , mate , ” shout a young man in the crowd whose appetit wa arous . “ get in , all get in , ” cri mikolka , “ she will draw you all . i ’ ll beat her to death ! ” and he thrash and thrash at the mare , besid himself with furi . “ father , father , ” he cri , “ father , what are they do ? father , they are beat the poor hors ! ” “ come along , come along ! ” said hi father . “ they are drunken and foolish , they are in fun ; come away , don ’ t look ! ” and he tri to draw him away , but he tore himself away from hi hand , and , besid himself with horror , ran to the hors . the poor beast wa in a bad way . she wa gasp , stand still , then tug again and almost fall . “ beat her to death , ” cri mikolka , “ it ’ s come to that . i ’ ll do for her ! ” “ what are you about , are you a christian , you devil ? ” shout an old man in the crowd . “ did anyon ever see the like ? a wretch nag like that pull such a cartload , ” said anoth . “ you ’ ll kill her , ” shout the third . “ don ’ t meddl ! it ’ s my properti , i ’ ll do what i choos . get in , more of you ! get in , all of you ! i will have her go at a gallop ! ... ” all at onc laughter broke into a roar and cover everyth : the mare , rous by the shower of blow , began feebli kick . even the old man could not help smile . to think of a wretch littl beast like that tri to kick ! two lad in the crowd snatch up whip and ran to the mare to beat her about the rib . one ran each side . “ hit her in the face , in the eye , in the eye , ” cri mikolka . “ give us a song , mate , ” shout someon in the cart and everyon in the cart join in a riotou song , jingl a tambourin and whistl . the woman went on crack nut and laugh . ... he ran besid the mare , ran in front of her , saw her be whip across the eye , right in the eye ! he wa cri , he felt choke , hi tear were stream . one of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face , he did not feel it . wring hi hand and scream , he rush up to the grey-head old man with the grey beard , who wa shake hi head in disapprov . one woman seiz him by the hand and would have taken him away , but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare . she wa almost at the last gasp , but began kick onc more . “ i ’ ll teach you to kick , ” mikolka shout feroci . he threw down the whip , bent forward and pick up from the bottom of the cart a long , thick shaft , he took hold of one end with both hand and with an effort brandish it over the mare . “ he ’ ll crush her , ” wa shout round him . “ he ’ ll kill her ! ” “ it ’ s my properti , ” shout mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swing blow . there wa a sound of a heavi thud . “ thrash her , thrash her ! whi have you stop ? ” shout voic in the crowd . and mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare . she sank back on her haunch , but lurch forward and tug forward with all her forc , tug first on one side and then on the other , tri to move the cart . but the six whip were attack her in all direct , and the shaft wa rais again and fell upon her a third time , then a fourth , with heavi measur blow . mikolka wa in a furi that he could not kill her at one blow . “ she ’ s a tough one , ” wa shout in the crowd . “ she ’ ll fall in a minut , mate , there will soon be an end of her , ” said an admir spectat in the crowd . “ fetch an axe to her ! finish her off , ” shout a third . “ i ’ ll show you ! stand off , ” mikolka scream frantic ; he threw down the shaft , stoop down in the cart and pick up an iron crowbar . “ look out , ” he shout , and with all hi might he dealt a stun blow at the poor mare . the blow fell ; the mare stagger , sank back , tri to pull , but the bar fell again with a swing blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log . “ finish her off , ” shout mikolka and he leapt besid himself , out of the cart . sever young men , also flush with drink , seiz anyth they could come across -- whip , stick , pole , and ran to the die mare . mikolka stood on one side and began deal random blow with the crowbar . the mare stretch out her head , drew a long breath and die . “ you butcher her , ” someon shout in the crowd . “ whi wouldn ’ t she gallop then ? ” “ my properti ! ” shout mikolka , with bloodshot eye , brandish the bar in hi hand . he stood as though regret that he had noth more to beat . “ no mistak about it , you are not a christian , ” mani voic were shout in the crowd . but the poor boy , besid himself , made hi way , scream , through the crowd to the sorrel nag , put hi arm round her bleed dead head and kiss it , kiss the eye and kiss the lip .... then he jump up and flew in a frenzi with hi littl fist out at mikolka . at that instant hi father , who had been run after him , snatch him up and carri him out of the crowd . “ come along , come ! let us go home , ” he said to him . “ father ! whi did they ... kill ... the poor hors ! ” he sob , but hi voic broke and the word came in shriek from hi pant chest . “ they are drunk .... they are brutal ... it ’ s not our busi ! ” said hi father . he put hi arm round hi father but he felt choke , choke . he tri to draw a breath , to cri out -- and woke up . he wake up , gasp for breath , hi hair soak with perspir , and stood up in terror . “ thank god , that wa onli a dream , ” he said , sit down under a tree and draw deep breath . “ but what is it ? is it some fever come on ? such a hideou dream ! ” he felt utterli broken : dark and confus were in hi soul . he rest hi elbow on hi knee and lean hi head on hi hand . “ good god ! ” he cri , “ can it be , can it be , that i shall realli take an axe , that i shall strike her on the head , split her skull open ... that i shall tread in the sticki warm blood , break the lock , steal and trembl ; hide , all spatter in the blood ... with the axe .... good god , can it be ? ” he wa shake like a leaf as he said thi . “ but whi am i go on like thi ? ” he continu , sit up again , as it were in profound amaz . “ i knew that i could never bring myself to it , so what have i been tortur myself for till now ? yesterday , yesterday , when i went to make that ... _experiment_ , yesterday i realis complet that i could never bear to do it .... whi am i go over it again , then ? whi am i hesit ? as i came down the stair yesterday , i said myself that it wa base , loathsom , vile , vile ... the veri thought of it made me feel sick and fill me with horror . “ no , i couldn ’ t do it , i couldn ’ t do it ! grant , grant that there is no flaw in all that reason , that all that i have conclud thi last month is clear as day , true as arithmet .... my god ! anyway i couldn ’ t bring myself to it ! i couldn ’ t do it , i couldn ’ t do it ! whi , whi then am i still ... ? ” he rose to hi feet , look round in wonder as though surpris at find himself in thi place , and went toward the bridg . he wa pale , hi eye glow , he wa exhaust in everi limb , but he seem suddenli to breath more easili . he felt he had cast off that fear burden that had so long been weigh upon him , and all at onc there wa a sens of relief and peac in hi soul . “ lord , ” he pray , “ show me my path -- i renounc that accurs ... dream of mine. ” cross the bridg , he gaze quietli and calmli at the neva , at the glow red sun set in the glow sky . in spite of hi weak he wa not consciou of fatigu . it wa as though an abscess that had been form for a month past in hi heart had suddenli broken . freedom , freedom ! he wa free from that spell , that sorceri , that obsess ! later on , when he recal that time and all that happen to him dure those day , minut by minut , point by point , he wa superstiti impress by one circumst , which , though in itself not veri except , alway seem to him afterward the predestin turning-point of hi fate . he could never understand and explain to himself whi , when he wa tire and worn out , when it would have been more conveni for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way , he had return by the hay market where he had no need to go . it wa obvious and quit unnecessarili out of hi way , though not much so . it is true that it happen to him dozen of time to return home without notic what street he pass through . but whi , he wa alway ask himself , whi had such an import , such a decis and at the same time such an absolut chanc meet happen in the hay market ( where he had moreov no reason to go ) at the veri hour , the veri minut of hi life when he wa just in the veri mood and in the veri circumst in which that meet wa abl to exert the gravest and most decis influenc on hi whole destini ? as though it had been lie in wait for him on purpos ! it wa about nine o ’ clock when he cross the hay market . at the tabl and the barrow , at the booth and the shop , all the market peopl were close their establish or clear away and pack up their ware and , like their custom , were go home . rag picker and costermong of all kind were crowd round the tavern in the dirti and stink courtyard of the hay market . raskolnikov particularli like thi place and the neighbour alley , when he wander aimlessli in the street . here hi rag did not attract contemptu attent , and one could walk about in ani attir without scandalis peopl . at the corner of an alley a huckster and hi wife had two tabl set out with tape , thread , cotton handkerchief , etc . they , too , had got up to go home , but were linger in convers with a friend , who had just come up to them . thi friend wa lizaveta ivanovna , or , as everyon call her , lizaveta , the younger sister of the old pawnbrok , alyona ivanovna , whom raskolnikov had visit the previou day to pawn hi watch and make hi _experiment_ .... he alreadi knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a littl too . she wa a singl woman of about thirty-f , tall , clumsi , timid , submiss and almost idiot . she wa a complet slave and went in fear and trembl of her sister , who made her work day and night , and even beat her . she wa stand with a bundl befor the huckster and hi wife , listen earnestli and doubt . they were talk of someth with special warmth . the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her , he wa overcom by a strang sensat as it were of intens astonish , though there wa noth astonish about thi meet . “ you could make up your mind for yourself , lizaveta ivanovna , ” the huckster wa say aloud . “ come round to-morrow about seven . they will be here too. ” “ to-morrow ? ” said lizaveta slowli and thought , as though unabl to make up her mind . “ upon my word , what a fright you are in of alyona ivanovna , ” gabbl the huckster ’ s wife , a live littl woman . “ i look at you , you are like some littl babe . and she is not your own sister either -- noth but a step-sist and what a hand she keep over you ! ” “ but thi time don ’ t say a word to alyona ivanovna , ” her husband interrupt ; “ that ’ s my advic , but come round to us without ask . it will be worth your while . later on your sister herself may have a notion. ” “ am i to come ? ” “ about seven o ’ clock to-morrow . and they will be here . you will be abl to decid for yourself. ” “ and we ’ ll have a cup of tea , ” ad hi wife . “ all right , i ’ ll come , ” said lizaveta , still ponder , and she began slowli move away . raskolnikov had just pass and heard no more . he pass softli , unnot , tri not to miss a word . hi first amaz wa follow by a thrill of horror , like a shiver run down hi spine . he had learnt , he had suddenli quit unexpectedli learnt , that the next day at seven o ’ clock lizaveta , the old woman ’ s sister and onli companion , would be away from home and that therefor at seven o ’ clock precis the old woman _would be left alone_ . he wa onli a few step from hi lodg . he went in like a man condemn to death . he thought of noth and wa incap of think ; but he felt suddenli in hi whole be that he had no more freedom of thought , no will , and that everyth wa suddenli and irrevoc decid . certainli , if he had to wait whole year for a suitabl opportun , he could not reckon on a more certain step toward the success of the plan than that which had just present itself . in ani case , it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainti , with greater exact and less risk , and without danger inquiri and investig , that next day at a certain time an old woman , on whose life an attempt wa contempl , would be at home and entir alon . chapter vi later on raskolnikov happen to find out whi the huckster and hi wife had invit lizaveta . it wa a veri ordinari matter and there wa noth except about it . a famili who had come to the town and been reduc to poverti were sell their household good and cloth , all women ’ s thing . as the thing would have fetch littl in the market , they were look for a dealer . thi wa lizaveta ’ s busi . she undertook such job and wa frequent employ , as she wa veri honest and alway fix a fair price and stuck to it . she spoke as a rule littl and , as we have said alreadi , she wa veri submiss and timid . but raskolnikov had becom superstiti of late . the trace of superstit remain in him long after , and were almost ineradic . and in all thi he wa alway afterward dispos to see someth strang and mysteri , as it were , the presenc of some peculiar influenc and coincid . in the previou winter a student he knew call pokorev , who had left for harkov , had chanc in convers to give him the address of alyona ivanovna , the old pawnbrok , in case he might want to pawn anyth . for a long while he did not go to her , for he had lesson and manag to get along somehow . six week ago he had rememb the address ; he had two articl that could be pawn : hi father ’ s old silver watch and a littl gold ring with three red stone , a present from hi sister at part . he decid to take the ring . when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmount repuls for her at the first glanc , though he knew noth special about her . he got two roubl from her and went into a miser littl tavern on hi way home . he ask for tea , sat down and sank into deep thought . a strang idea wa peck at hi brain like a chicken in the egg , and veri , veri much absorb him . almost besid him at the next tabl there wa sit a student , whom he did not know and had never seen , and with him a young offic . they had play a game of billiard and began drink tea . all at onc he heard the student mention to the offic the pawnbrok alyona ivanovna and give him her address . thi of itself seem strang to raskolnikov ; he had just come from her and here at onc he heard her name . of cours it wa a chanc , but he could not shake off a veri extraordinari impress , and here someon seem to be speak expressli for him ; the student began tell hi friend variou detail about alyona ivanovna . “ she is first-rat , ” he said . “ you can alway get money from her . she is as rich as a jew , she can give you five thousand roubl at a time and she is not abov take a pledg for a roubl . lot of our fellow have had deal with her . but she is an aw old harpi .... ” and he began describ how spite and uncertain she wa , how if you were onli a day late with your interest the pledg wa lost ; how she gave a quarter of the valu of an articl and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on . the student chatter on , say that she had a sister lizaveta , whom the wretch littl creatur wa continu beat , and kept in complet bondag like a small child , though lizaveta wa at least six feet high . “ there ’ s a phenomenon for you , ” cri the student and he laugh . they began talk about lizaveta . the student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and wa continu laugh and the offic listen with great interest and ask him to send lizaveta to do some mend for him . raskolnikov did not miss a word and learn everyth about her . lizaveta wa younger than the old woman and wa her half-sist , be the child of a differ mother . she wa thirty-f . she work day and night for her sister , and besid do the cook and the wash , she did sew and work as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earn . she did not dare to accept an order or job of ani kind without her sister ’ s permiss . the old woman had alreadi made her will , and lizaveta knew of it , and by thi will she would not get a farth ; noth but the movabl , chair and so on ; all the money wa left to a monasteri in the provinc of n -- -- , that prayer might be said for her in perpetu . lizaveta wa of lower rank than her sister , unmarri and aw uncouth in appear , remark tall with long feet that look as if they were bent outward . she alway wore batter goatskin shoe , and wa clean in her person . what the student express most surpris and amus about wa the fact that lizaveta wa continu with child . “ but you say she is hideou ? ” observ the offic . “ ye , she is so dark-skin and look like a soldier dress up , but you know she is not at all hideou . she ha such a good-natur face and eye . strikingli so . and the proof of it is that lot of peopl are attract by her . she is such a soft , gentl creatur , readi to put up with anyth , alway will , will to do anyth . and her smile is realli veri sweet. ” “ you seem to find her attract yourself , ” laugh the offic . “ from her queer . no , i ’ ll tell you what . i could kill that damn old woman and make off with her money , i assur you , without the faintest conscience-prick , ” the student ad with warmth . the offic laugh again while raskolnikov shudder . how strang it wa ! “ listen , i want to ask you a seriou question , ” the student said hotli . “ i wa joke of cours , but look here ; on one side we have a stupid , senseless , worthless , spite , ail , horrid old woman , not simpli useless but do actual mischief , who ha not an idea what she is live for herself , and who will die in a day or two in ani case . you understand ? you understand ? ” “ ye , ye , i understand , ” answer the offic , watch hi excit companion attent . “ well , listen then . on the other side , fresh young live thrown away for want of help and by thousand , on everi side ! a hundr thousand good deed could be done and help , on that old woman ’ s money which will be buri in a monasteri ! hundr , thousand perhap , might be set on the right path ; dozen of famili save from destitut , from ruin , from vice , from the lock hospit -- and all with her money . kill her , take her money and with the help of it devot oneself to the servic of human and the good of all . what do you think , would not one tini crime be wipe out by thousand of good deed ? for one life thousand would be save from corrupt and decay . one death , and a hundr live in exchang -- it ’ s simpl arithmet ! besid , what valu ha the life of that sickli , stupid , ill-natur old woman in the balanc of exist ! no more than the life of a lous , of a black-beetl , less in fact becaus the old woman is do harm . she is wear out the live of other ; the other day she bit lizaveta ’ s finger out of spite ; it almost had to be amputated. ” “ of cours she doe not deserv to live , ” remark the offic , “ but there it is , it ’ s nature. ” “ oh , well , brother , but we have to correct and direct natur , and , but for that , we should drown in an ocean of prejudic . but for that , there would never have been a singl great man . they talk of duti , conscienc -- i don ’ t want to say anyth against duti and conscienc ; -- but the point is , what do we mean by them ? stay , i have anoth question to ask you . listen ! ” “ no , you stay , i ’ ll ask you a question . listen ! ” “ well ? ” “ you are talk and speechifi away , but tell me , would you kill the old woman _yourself_ ? ” “ of cours not ! i wa onli argu the justic of it .... it ’ s noth to do with me .... ” “ but i think , if you would not do it yourself , there ’ s no justic about it .... let us have anoth game. ” raskolnikov wa violent agit . of cours , it wa all ordinari youth talk and thought , such as he had often heard befor in differ form and on differ theme . but whi had he happen to hear such a discuss and such idea at the veri moment when hi own brain wa just conceiv ... _the veri same ideas_ ? and whi , just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of hi idea from the old woman had he drop at onc upon a convers about her ? thi coincid alway seem strang to him . thi trivial talk in a tavern had an immens influenc on him in hi later action ; as though there had realli been in it someth preordain , some guid hint .... * * * * * on return from the hay market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stir . meanwhil it got dark ; he had no candl and , inde , it did not occur to him to light up . he could never recollect whether he had been think about anyth at that time . at last he wa consciou of hi former fever and shiver , and he realis with relief that he could lie down on the sofa . soon heavi , leaden sleep came over him , as it were crush him . he slept an extraordinarili long time and without dream . nastasya , come into hi room at ten o ’ clock the next morn , had difficulti in rous him . she brought him in tea and bread . the tea wa again the second brew and again in her own tea-pot . “ my good , how he sleep ! ” she cri indignantli . “ and he is alway asleep. ” he got up with an effort . hi head ach , he stood up , took a turn in hi garret and sank back on the sofa again . “ go to sleep again , ” cri nastasya . “ are you ill , eh ? ” he made no repli . “ do you want some tea ? ” “ afterward , ” he said with an effort , close hi eye again and turn to the wall . nastasya stood over him . “ perhap he realli is ill , ” she said , turn and went out . she came in again at two o ’ clock with soup . he wa lie as befor . the tea stood untouch . nastasya felt posit offend and began wrath rous him . “ whi are you lie like a log ? ” she shout , look at him with repuls . he got up , and sat down again , but said noth and stare at the floor . “ are you ill or not ? ” ask nastasya and again receiv no answer . “ you ’ d better go out and get a breath of air , ” she said after a paus . “ will you eat it or not ? ” “ afterward , ” he said weakli . “ you can go. ” and he motion her out . she remain a littl longer , look at him with compass and went out . a few minut afterward , he rais hi eye and look for a long while at the tea and the soup . then he took the bread , took up a spoon and began to eat . he ate a littl , three or four spoon , without appetit , as it were mechan . hi head ach less . after hi meal he stretch himself on the sofa again , but now he could not sleep ; he lay without stir , with hi face in the pillow . he wa haunt by day-dream and such strang day-dream ; in one , that kept recur , he fanci that he wa in africa , in egypt , in some sort of oasi . the caravan wa rest , the camel were peac lie down ; the palm stood all around in a complet circl ; all the parti were at dinner . but he wa drink water from a spring which flow gurgl close by . and it wa so cool , it wa wonder , wonder , blue , cold water run among the parti-colour stone and over the clean sand which glisten here and there like gold .... suddenli he heard a clock strike . he start , rous himself , rais hi head , look out of the window , and see how late it wa , suddenli jump up wide awak as though someon had pull him off the sofa . he crept on tipto to the door , stealthili open it and began listen on the staircas . hi heart beat terribl . but all wa quiet on the stair as if everyon wa asleep .... it seem to him strang and monstrou that he could have slept in such forget from the previou day and had done noth , had prepar noth yet .... and meanwhil perhap it had struck six . and hi drowsi and stupefact were follow by an extraordinari , feverish , as it were distract hast . but the prepar to be made were few . he concentr all hi energi on think of everyth and forget noth ; and hi heart kept beat and thump so that he could hardli breath . first he had to make a noos and sew it into hi overcoat -- a work of a moment . he rummag under hi pillow and pick out amongst the linen stuf away under it , a worn out , old unwash shirt . from it rag he tore a long strip , a coupl of inch wide and about sixteen inch long . he fold thi strip in two , took off hi wide , strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton materi ( hi onli outer garment ) and began sew the two end of the rag on the insid , under the left armhol . hi hand shook as he sew , but he did it success so that noth show outsid when he put the coat on again . the needl and thread he had got readi long befor and they lay on hi tabl in a piec of paper . as for the noos , it wa a veri ingeni devic of hi own ; the noos wa intend for the axe . it wa imposs for him to carri the axe through the street in hi hand . and if hidden under hi coat he would still have had to support it with hi hand , which would have been notic . now he had onli to put the head of the axe in the noos , and it would hang quietli under hi arm on the insid . put hi hand in hi coat pocket , he could hold the end of the handl all the way , so that it did not swing ; and as the coat wa veri full , a regular sack in fact , it could not be seen from outsid that he wa hold someth with the hand that wa in the pocket . thi noos , too , he had design a fortnight befor . when he had finish with thi , he thrust hi hand into a littl open between hi sofa and the floor , fumbl in the left corner and drew out the _pledge_ , which he had got readi long befor and hidden there . thi pledg wa , howev , onli a smoothli plane piec of wood the size and thick of a silver cigarett case . he pick up thi piec of wood in one of hi wander in a courtyard where there wa some sort of a workshop . afterward he had ad to the wood a thin smooth piec of iron , which he had also pick up at the same time in the street . put the iron which wa a littl the smaller on the piec of wood , he fasten them veri firmli , cross and re-cross the thread round them ; then wrap them care and daintili in clean white paper and tie up the parcel so that it would be veri difficult to unti it . thi wa in order to divert the attent of the old woman for a time , while she wa tri to undo the knot , and so to gain a moment . the iron strip wa ad to give weight , so that the woman might not guess the first minut that the “ thing ” wa made of wood . all thi had been store by him beforehand under the sofa . he had onli just got the pledg out when he heard someon suddenli about in the yard . “ it struck six long ago. ” “ long ago ! my god ! ” he rush to the door , listen , caught up hi hat and began to descend hi thirteen step cautious , noiselessli , like a cat . he had still the most import thing to do -- to steal the axe from the kitchen . that the deed must be done with an axe he had decid long ago . he had also a pocket pruning-knif , but he could not reli on the knife and still less on hi own strength , and so resolv final on the axe . we may note in pass , one peculiar in regard to all the final resolut taken by him in the matter ; they had one strang characterist : the more final they were , the more hideou and the more absurd they at onc becam in hi eye . in spite of all hi agonis inward struggl , he never for a singl instant all that time could believ in the carri out of hi plan . and , inde , if it had ever happen that everyth to the least point could have been consid and final settl , and no uncertainti of ani kind had remain , he would , it seem , have renounc it all as someth absurd , monstrou and imposs . but a whole mass of unsettl point and uncertainti remain . as for get the axe , that trifl busi cost him no anxieti , for noth could be easier . nastasya wa continu out of the hous , especi in the even ; she would run in to the neighbour or to a shop , and alway left the door ajar . it wa the one thing the landladi wa alway scold her about . and so , when the time came , he would onli have to go quietli into the kitchen and to take the axe , and an hour later ( when everyth wa over ) go in and put it back again . but these were doubt point . suppos he return an hour later to put it back , and nastasya had come back and wa on the spot . he would of cours have to go by and wait till she went out again . but suppos she were in the meantim to miss the axe , look for it , make an outcri -- that would mean suspicion or at least ground for suspicion . but those were all trifl which he had not even begun to consid , and inde he had no time . he wa think of the chief point , and put off trifl detail , until _he could believ in it all_ . but that seem utterli unattain . so it seem to himself at least . he could not imagin , for instanc , that he would sometim leav off think , get up and simpli go there .... even hi late experi ( i.e . hi visit with the object of a final survey of the place ) wa simpli an attempt at an experi , far from be the real thing , as though one should say “ come , let us go and tri it -- whi dream about it ! ” -- and at onc he had broken down and had run away curs , in a frenzi with himself . meanwhil it would seem , as regard the moral question , that hi analysi wa complet ; hi casuistri had becom keen as a razor , and he could not find ration object in himself . but in the last resort he simpli ceas to believ in himself , and doggedli , slavishli sought argument in all direct , fumbl for them , as though someon were forc and draw him to it . at first -- long befor inde -- he had been much occupi with one question ; whi almost all crime are so badli conceal and so easili detect , and whi almost all crimin leav such obviou trace ? he had come gradual to mani differ and curiou conclus , and in hi opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the materi imposs of conceal the crime , as in the crimin himself . almost everi crimin is subject to a failur of will and reason power by a childish and phenomen heedless , at the veri instant when prudenc and caution are most essenti . it wa hi convict that thi eclips of reason and failur of will power attack a man like a diseas , develop gradual and reach it highest point just befor the perpetr of the crime , continu with equal violenc at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after , accord to the individu case , and then pass off like ani other diseas . the question whether the diseas give rise to the crime , or whether the crime from it own peculiar natur is alway accompani by someth of the natur of diseas , he did not yet feel abl to decid . when he reach these conclus , he decid that in hi own case there could not be such a morbid reaction , that hi reason and will would remain unimpair at the time of carri out hi design , for the simpl reason that hi design wa “ not a crime .... ” we will omit all the process by mean of which he arriv at thi last conclus ; we have run too far ahead alreadi .... we may add onli that the practic , pure materi difficulti of the affair occupi a secondari posit in hi mind . “ one ha but to keep all one ’ s will-pow and reason to deal with them , and they will all be overcom at the time when onc one ha familiaris oneself with the minutest detail of the busi .... ” but thi prepar had never been begun . hi final decis were what he came to trust least , and when the hour struck , it all came to pass quit differ , as it were accident and unexpectedli . one trifl circumst upset hi calcul , befor he had even left the staircas . when he reach the landladi ’ s kitchen , the door of which wa open as usual , he glanc cautious in to see whether , in nastasya ’ s absenc , the landladi herself wa there , or if not , whether the door to her own room wa close , so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe . but what wa hi amaz when he suddenli saw that nastasya wa not onli at home in the kitchen , but wa occupi there , take linen out of a basket and hang it on a line . see him , she left off hang the cloth , turn to him and stare at him all the time he wa pass . he turn away hi eye , and walk past as though he notic noth . but it wa the end of everyth ; he had not the axe ! he wa overwhelm . “ what made me think , ” he reflect , as he went under the gateway , “ what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment ! whi , whi , whi did i assum thi so certainli ? ” he wa crush and even humili . he could have laugh at himself in hi anger .... a dull anim rage boil within him . he stood hesit in the gateway . to go into the street , to go a walk for appear ’ sake wa revolt ; to go back to hi room , even more revolt . “ and what a chanc i have lost for ever ! ” he mutter , stand aimlessli in the gateway , just opposit the porter ’ s littl dark room , which wa also open . suddenli he start . from the porter ’ s room , two pace away from him , someth shine under the bench to the right caught hi eye .... he look about him -- nobodi . he approach the room on tipto , went down two step into it and in a faint voic call the porter . “ ye , not at home ! somewher near though , in the yard , for the door is wide open. ” he dash to the axe ( it wa an axe ) and pull it out from under the bench , where it lay between two chunk of wood ; at onc , befor go out , he made it fast in the noos , he thrust both hand into hi pocket and went out of the room ; no one had notic him ! “ when reason fail , the devil help ! ” he thought with a strang grin . thi chanc rais hi spirit extraordinarili . he walk along quietli and sedat , without hurri , to avoid awaken suspicion . he scarc look at the passers-bi , tri to escap look at their face at all , and to be as littl notic as possibl . suddenli he thought of hi hat . “ good heaven ! i had the money the day befor yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead ! ” a curs rose from the bottom of hi soul . glanc out of the corner of hi eye into a shop , he saw by a clock on the wall that it wa ten minut past seven . he had to make hast and at the same time to go someway round , so as to approach the hous from the other side .... when he had happen to imagin all thi beforehand , he had sometim thought that he would be veri much afraid . but he wa not veri much afraid now , wa not afraid at all , inde . hi mind wa even occupi by irrelev matter , but by noth for long . as he pass the yusupov garden , he wa deepli absorb in consid the build of great fountain , and of their refresh effect on the atmospher in all the squar . by degre he pass to the convict that if the summer garden were extend to the field of mar , and perhap join to the garden of the mihailovski palac , it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town . then he wa interest by the question whi in all great town men are not simpli driven by necess , but in some peculiar way inclin to live in those part of the town where there are no garden nor fountain ; where there is most dirt and smell and all sort of nasti . then hi own walk through the hay market came back to hi mind , and for a moment he wake up to realiti . “ what nonsens ! ” he thought , “ better think of noth at all ! ” “ so probabl men led to execut clutch mental at everi object that meet them on the way , ” flash through hi mind , but simpli flash , like lightn ; he made hast to dismiss thi thought .... and by now he wa near ; here wa the hous , here wa the gate . suddenli a clock somewher struck onc . “ what ! can it be half-past seven ? imposs , it must be fast ! ” luckili for him , everyth went well again at the gate . at that veri moment , as though expressli for hi benefit , a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate , complet screen him as he pass under the gateway , and the waggon had scarc had time to drive through into the yard , befor he had slip in a flash to the right . on the other side of the waggon he could hear shout and quarrel ; but no one notic him and no one met him . mani window look into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment , but he did not rais hi head -- he had not the strength to . the staircas lead to the old woman ’ s room wa close by , just on the right of the gateway . he wa alreadi on the stair .... draw a breath , press hi hand against hi throb heart , and onc more feel for the axe and set it straight , he began softli and cautious ascend the stair , listen everi minut . but the stair , too , were quit desert ; all the door were shut ; he met no one . one flat inde on the first floor wa wide open and painter were at work in it , but they did not glanc at him . he stood still , thought a minut and went on . “ of cours it would be better if they had not been here , but ... it ’ s two storey abov them. ” and there wa the fourth storey , here wa the door , here wa the flat opposit , the empti one . the flat underneath the old woman ’ s wa appar empti also ; the visit card nail on the door had been torn off -- they had gone away ! ... he wa out of breath . for one instant the thought float through hi mind “ shall i go back ? ” but he made no answer and began listen at the old woman ’ s door , a dead silenc . then he listen again on the staircas , listen long and intent ... then look about him for the last time , pull himself togeth , drew himself up , and onc more tri the axe in the noos . “ am i veri pale ? ” he wonder . “ am i not evid agit ? she is mistrust .... had i better wait a littl longer ... till my heart leav off thump ? ” but hi heart did not leav off . on the contrari , as though to spite him , it throb more and more violent . he could stand it no longer , he slowli put out hi hand to the bell and rang . half a minut later he rang again , more loudli . no answer . to go on ring wa useless and out of place . the old woman wa , of cours , at home , but she wa suspici and alon . he had some knowledg of her habit ... and onc more he put hi ear to the door . either hi sens were peculiarli keen ( which it is difficult to suppos ) , or the sound wa realli veri distinct . anyway , he suddenli heard someth like the cautiou touch of a hand on the lock and the rustl of a skirt at the veri door . someon wa stand stealthili close to the lock and just as he wa do on the outsid wa secretli listen within , and seem to have her ear to the door .... he move a littl on purpos and mutter someth aloud that he might not have the appear of hide , then rang a third time , but quietli , soberli , and without impati , recal it afterward , that moment stood out in hi mind vividli , distinctli , for ever ; he could not make out how he had had such cun , for hi mind wa as it were cloud at moment and he wa almost unconsci of hi bodi .... an instant later he heard the latch unfasten . chapter vii the door wa as befor open a tini crack , and again two sharp and suspici eye stare at him out of the dark . then raskolnikov lost hi head and nearli made a great mistak . fear the old woman would be frighten by their be alon , and not hope that the sight of him would disarm her suspicion , he took hold of the door and drew it toward him to prevent the old woman from attempt to shut it again . see thi she did not pull the door back , but she did not let go the handl so that he almost drag her out with it on to the stair . see that she wa stand in the doorway not allow him to pass , he advanc straight upon her . she step back in alarm , tri to say someth , but seem unabl to speak and stare with open eye at him . “ good even , alyona ivanovna , ” he began , tri to speak easili , but hi voic would not obey him , it broke and shook . “ i have come ... i have brought someth ... but we ’ d better come in ... to the light .... ” and leav her , he pass straight into the room uninvit . the old woman ran after him ; her tongu wa unloos . “ good heaven ! what it is ? who is it ? what do you want ? ” “ whi , alyona ivanovna , you know me ... raskolnikov ... here , i brought you the pledg i promis the other day ... ” and he held out the pledg . the old woman glanc for a moment at the pledg , but at onc stare in the eye of her uninvit visitor . she look intent , malici and mistrust . a minut pass ; he even fanci someth like a sneer in her eye , as though she had alreadi guess everyth . he felt that he wa lose hi head , that he wa almost frighten , so frighten that if she were to look like that and not say a word for anoth half minut , he thought he would have run away from her . “ whi do you look at me as though you did not know me ? ” he said suddenli , also with malic . “ take it if you like , if not i ’ ll go elsewher , i am in a hurry. ” he had not even thought of say thi , but it wa suddenli said of itself . the old woman recov herself , and her visitor ’ s resolut tone evid restor her confid . “ but whi , my good sir , all of a minut .... what is it ? ” she ask , look at the pledg . “ the silver cigarett case ; i spoke of it last time , you know. ” she held out her hand . “ but how pale you are , to be sure ... and your hand are trembl too ? have you been bath , or what ? ” “ fever , ” he answer abruptli . “ you can ’ t help get pale ... if you ’ ve noth to eat , ” he ad , with difficulti articul the word . hi strength wa fail him again . but hi answer sound like the truth ; the old woman took the pledg . “ what is it ? ” she ask onc more , scan raskolnikov intent , and weigh the pledg in her hand . “ a thing ... cigarett case .... silver .... look at it. ” “ it doe not seem somehow like silver .... how he ha wrap it up ! ” tri to unti the string and turn to the window , to the light ( all her window were shut , in spite of the stifl heat ) , she left him altogeth for some second and stood with her back to him . he unbutton hi coat and freed the axe from the noos , but did not yet take it out altogeth , simpli hold it in hi right hand under the coat . hi hand were fear weak , he felt them everi moment grow more numb and more wooden . he wa afraid he would let the axe slip and fall .... a sudden giddi came over him . “ but what ha he tie it up like thi for ? ” the old woman cri with vexat and move toward him . he had not a minut more to lose . he pull the axe quit out , swung it with both arm , scarc consciou of himself , and almost without effort , almost mechan , brought the blunt side down on her head . he seem not to use hi own strength in thi . but as soon as he had onc brought the axe down , hi strength return to him . the old woman wa as alway barehead . her thin , light hair , streak with grey , thickli smear with greas , wa plait in a rat ’ s tail and fasten by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck . as she wa so short , the blow fell on the veri top of her skull . she cri out , but veri faintli , and suddenli sank all of a heap on the floor , rais her hand to her head . in one hand she still held “ the pledge. ” then he dealt her anoth and anoth blow with the blunt side and on the same spot . the blood gush as from an overturn glass , the bodi fell back . he step back , let it fall , and at onc bent over her face ; she wa dead . her eye seem to be start out of their socket , the brow and the whole face were drawn and contort convuls . he laid the axe on the ground near the dead bodi and felt at onc in her pocket ( tri to avoid the stream bodi ) -- the same right-hand pocket from which she had taken the key on hi last visit . he wa in full possess of hi faculti , free from confus or giddi , but hi hand were still trembl . he rememb afterward that he had been particularli collect and care , tri all the time not to get smear with blood .... he pull out the key at onc , they were all , as befor , in one bunch on a steel ring . he ran at onc into the bedroom with them . it wa a veri small room with a whole shrine of holi imag . against the other wall stood a big bed , veri clean and cover with a silk patchwork wad quilt . against a third wall wa a chest of drawer . strang to say , so soon as he began to fit the key into the chest , so soon as he heard their jingl , a convuls shudder pass over him . he suddenli felt tempt again to give it all up and go away . but that wa onli for an instant ; it wa too late to go back . he posit smile at himself , when suddenli anoth terrifi idea occur to hi mind . he suddenli fanci that the old woman might be still aliv and might recov her sens . leav the key in the chest , he ran back to the bodi , snatch up the axe and lift it onc more over the old woman , but did not bring it down . there wa no doubt that she wa dead . bend down and examin her again more close , he saw clearli that the skull wa broken and even batter in on one side . he wa about to feel it with hi finger , but drew back hi hand and inde it wa evid without that . meanwhil there wa a perfect pool of blood . all at onc he notic a string on her neck ; he tug at it , but the string wa strong and did not snap and besid , it wa soak with blood . he tri to pull it out from the front of the dress , but someth held it and prevent it come . in hi impati he rais the axe again to cut the string from abov on the bodi , but did not dare , and with difficulti , smear hi hand and the axe in the blood , after two minut ’ hurri effort , he cut the string and took it off without touch the bodi with the axe ; he wa not mistaken -- it wa a purs . on the string were two cross , one of cypru wood and one of copper , and an imag in silver filigre , and with them a small greasi chamoi leather purs with a steel rim and ring . the purs wa stuf veri full ; raskolnikov thrust it in hi pocket without look at it , flung the cross on the old woman ’ s bodi and rush back into the bedroom , thi time take the axe with him . he wa in terribl hast , he snatch the key , and began tri them again . but he wa unsuccess . they would not fit in the lock . it wa not so much that hi hand were shake , but that he kept make mistak ; though he saw for instanc that a key wa not the right one and would not fit , still he tri to put it in . suddenli he rememb and realis that the big key with the deep notch , which wa hang there with the small key could not possibl belong to the chest of drawer ( on hi last visit thi had struck him ) , but to some strong box , and that everyth perhap wa hidden in that box . he left the chest of drawer , and at onc felt under the bedstead , know that old women usual keep box under their bed . and so it wa ; there wa a good-siz box under the bed , at least a yard in length , with an arch lid cover with red leather and stud with steel nail . the notch key fit at onc and unlock it . at the top , under a white sheet , wa a coat of red brocad line with hareskin ; under it wa a silk dress , then a shawl and it seem as though there wa noth below but cloth . the first thing he did wa to wipe hi blood-stain hand on the red brocad . “ it ’ s red , and on red blood will be less notic , ” the thought pass through hi mind ; then he suddenli came to himself . “ good god , am i go out of my sens ? ” he thought with terror . but no sooner did he touch the cloth than a gold watch slip from under the fur coat . he made hast to turn them all over . there turn out to be variou articl made of gold among the cloth -- probabl all pledg , unredeem or wait to be redeem -- bracelet , chain , ear-r , pin and such thing . some were in case , other simpli wrap in newspap , care and exactli fold , and tie round with tape . without ani delay , he began fill up the pocket of hi trouser and overcoat without examin or undo the parcel and case ; but he had not time to take mani .... he suddenli heard step in the room where the old woman lay . he stop short and wa still as death . but all wa quiet , so it must have been hi fanci . all at onc he heard distinctli a faint cri , as though someon had utter a low broken moan . then again dead silenc for a minut or two . he sat squat on hi heel by the box and wait hold hi breath . suddenli he jump up , seiz the axe and ran out of the bedroom . in the middl of the room stood lizaveta with a big bundl in her arm . she wa gaze in stupefact at her murder sister , white as a sheet and seem not to have the strength to cri out . see him run out of the bedroom , she began faintli quiver all over , like a leaf , a shudder ran down her face ; she lift her hand , open her mouth , but still did not scream . she began slowli back away from him into the corner , stare intent , persist at him , but still utter no sound , as though she could not get breath to scream . he rush at her with the axe ; her mouth twitch piteous , as one see babi ’ mouth , when they begin to be frighten , stare intent at what frighten them and are on the point of scream . and thi hapless lizaveta wa so simpl and had been so thoroughli crush and scare that she did not even rais a hand to guard her face , though that wa the most necessari and natur action at the moment , for the axe wa rais over her face . she onli put up her empti left hand , but not to her face , slowli hold it out befor her as though motion him away . the axe fell with the sharp edg just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head . she fell heavili at onc . raskolnikov complet lost hi head , snatch up her bundl , drop it again and ran into the entri . fear gain more and more masteri over him , especi after thi second , quit unexpect murder . he long to run away from the place as fast as possibl . and if at that moment he had been capabl of see and reason more correctli , if he had been abl to realis all the difficulti of hi posit , the hopeless , the hideous and the absurd of it , if he could have understood how mani obstacl and , perhap , crime he had still to overcom or to commit , to get out of that place and to make hi way home , it is veri possibl that he would have flung up everyth , and would have gone to give himself up , and not from fear , but from simpl horror and loath of what he had done . the feel of loath especi surg up within him and grew stronger everi minut . he would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anyth in the world . but a sort of blank , even dreami , had begun by degre to take possess of him ; at moment he forgot himself , or rather , forgot what wa of import , and caught at trifl . glanc , howev , into the kitchen and see a bucket half full of water on a bench , he bethought him of wash hi hand and the axe . hi hand were sticki with blood . he drop the axe with the blade in the water , snatch a piec of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window , and began wash hi hand in the bucket . when they were clean , he took out the axe , wash the blade and spent a long time , about three minut , wash the wood where there were spot of blood rub them with soap . then he wipe it all with some linen that wa hang to dri on a line in the kitchen and then he wa a long while attent examin the axe at the window . there wa no trace left on it , onli the wood wa still damp . he care hung the axe in the noos under hi coat . then as far as wa possibl , in the dim light in the kitchen , he look over hi overcoat , hi trouser and hi boot . at the first glanc there seem to be noth but stain on the boot . he wet the rag and rub the boot . but he knew he wa not look thoroughli , that there might be someth quit notic that he wa overlook . he stood in the middl of the room , lost in thought . dark agonis idea rose in hi mind -- the idea that he wa mad and that at that moment he wa incap of reason , of protect himself , that he ought perhap to be do someth utterli differ from what he wa now do . “ good god ! ” he mutter “ i must fli , fli , ” and he rush into the entri . but here a shock of terror await him such as he had never known befor . he stood and gaze and could not believ hi eye : the door , the outer door from the stair , at which he had not long befor wait and rung , wa stand unfasten and at least six inch open . no lock , no bolt , all the time , all that time ! the old woman had not shut it after him perhap as a precaut . but , good god ! whi , he had seen lizaveta afterward ! and how could he , how could he have fail to reflect that she must have come in somehow ! she could not have come through the wall ! he dash to the door and fasten the latch . “ but no , the wrong thing again ! i must get away , get away .... ” he unfasten the latch , open the door and began listen on the staircas . he listen a long time . somewher far away , it might be in the

keyhol : but the key wa in the lock on the insid and so noth could be seen . raskolnikov stood keep tight hold of the axe . he wa in a sort of delirium . he wa even make readi to fight when they should come in . while they were knock and talk togeth , the idea sever time occur to him to end it all at onc and shout to them through the door . now and then he wa tempt to swear at them , to jeer at them , while they could not open the door ! “ onli make hast ! ” wa the thought that flash through hi mind . “ but what the devil is he about ? ... ” time wa pass , one minut , and anoth -- no one

. “ good heaven ! what am i to do ? ” raskolnikov unfasten the hook , open the door -- there wa no sound . abruptli , without ani thought at all , he went out , close the door as thoroughli as he could , and went downstair . he had gone down three flight when he suddenli heard a loud voic below -- where could he go ! there wa nowher to hide . he wa just go back to the flat . “ hey there ! catch the brute ! ” somebodi dash out of a flat below , shout , and rather fell than ran down the stair , bawl at the top of hi voic . “ mitka ! mitka ! mitka ! mitka ! mitka ! blast him ! ” the shout end in a shriek ; the last sound came from the yard ; all wa still . but at the same instant sever men talk loud and fast began noisili mount the stair . there were three or four of them . he distinguish the ring voic of the young man . “ hey ! ” fill with despair he went straight to meet them , feel “ come what must ! ” if they stop him -- all wa lost ; if they let him pass -- all wa lost too ; they would rememb him . they were approach ; they were onli a flight from him -- and suddenli deliver ! a few step from him on the right , there wa an empti flat with the door wide open , the flat on the second floor where the painter had been at work , and which , as though for hi benefit , they had just left . it wa they , no doubt , who had just run down , shout . the floor had onli just been paint , in the middl of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brush . in one instant he had whisk in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and onli in the nick of time ; they had alreadi reach the land . then they turn and went on up to the fourth floor , talk loudli . he wait , went out on tipto and ran down the stair . no one wa on the stair , nor in the gateway . he pass quickli through the gateway and turn to the left in the street . he knew , he knew perfectli well that at that moment they were at the flat , that they were greatli astonish at find it unlock , as the door had just been fasten , that by now they were look at the bodi , that befor anoth minut had pass they would guess and complet realis that the murder had just been there , and had succeed in hide somewher , slip by them and escap . they would guess most like that he had been in the empti flat , while they were go upstair . and meanwhil he dare not quicken hi pace much , though the next turn wa still nearli a hundr yard away . “ should he slip through some gateway and wait somewher in an unknown street ? no , hopeless ! should he fling away the axe ? should he take a cab ? hopeless , hopeless ! ” at last he reach the turn . he turn down it more dead than aliv . here he wa half way to safeti , and he understood it ; it wa less riski becaus there wa a great crowd of peopl , and he wa lost in it like a grain of sand . but all he had suffer had so weaken him that he could scarc move . perspir ran down him in drop , hi neck wa all wet . “ my word , he ha been go it ! ” someon shout at him when he came out on the canal bank . he wa onli dimli consciou of himself now , and the farther he went the wors it wa . he rememb howev , that on come out on to the canal bank , he wa alarm at find few peopl there and so be more conspicu , and he had thought of turn back . though he wa almost fall from fatigu , he went a long way round so as to get home from quit a differ direct . he wa not fulli consciou when he pass through the gateway of hi hous ! he wa alreadi on the staircas befor he recollect the axe . and yet he had a veri grave problem befor him , to put it back and to escap observ as far as possibl in do so . he wa of cours incap of reflect that it might perhap be far better not to restor the axe at all , but to drop it later on in somebodi ’ s yard . but it all happen fortun , the door of the porter ’ s room wa close but not lock , so that it seem most like that the porter wa at home . but he had so complet lost all power of reflect that he walk straight to the door and open it . if the porter had ask him , “ what do you want ? ” he would perhap have simpli hand him the axe . but again the porter wa not at home , and he succeed in put the axe back under the bench , and even cover it with the chunk of wood as befor . he met no one , not a soul , afterward on the way to hi room ; the landladi ’ s door wa shut . when he wa in hi room , he flung himself on the sofa just as he wa -- he did not sleep , but sank into blank forget . if anyon had come into hi room then , he would have jump up at onc and scream . scrap and shred of thought were simpli swarm in hi brain , but he could not catch at one , he could not rest on one , in spite of all hi effort .... part ii chapter i so he lay a veri long while . now and then he seem to wake up , and at such moment he notic that it wa far into the night , but it did not occur to him to get up . at last he notic that it wa begin to get light . he wa lie on hi back , still daze from hi recent oblivion . fear , despair cri rose shrilli from the street , sound which he heard everi night , inde , under hi window after two o ’ clock . they woke him up now . “ ah ! the drunken men are come out of the tavern , ” he thought , “ it ’ s past two o ’ clock , ” and at onc he leap up , as though someon had pull him from the sofa . “ what ! past two o ’ clock ! ” he sat down on the sofa -- and instantli recollect everyth ! all at onc , in one flash , he recollect everyth . for the first moment he thought he wa go mad . a dread chill came over him ; but the chill wa from the fever that had begun long befor in hi sleep . now he wa suddenli taken with violent shiver , so that hi teeth chatter and all hi limb were shake . he open the door and began listen -- everyth in the hous wa asleep . with amaz he gaze at himself and everyth in the room around him , wonder how he could have come in the night befor without fasten the door , and have flung himself on the sofa without undress , without even take hi hat off . it had fallen off and wa lie on the floor near hi pillow . “ if anyon had come in , what would he have thought ? that i ’ m drunk but ... ” he rush to the window . there wa light enough , and he began hurriedli look himself all over from head to foot , all hi cloth ; were there no trace ? but there wa no do it like that ; shiver with cold , he began take off everyth and look over again . he turn everyth over to the last thread and rag , and mistrust himself , went through hi search three time . but there seem to be noth , no trace , except in one place , where some thick drop of congeal blood were cling to the fray edg of hi trouser . he pick up a big claspknif and cut off the fray thread . there seem to be noth more . suddenli he rememb that the purs and the thing he had taken out of the old woman ’ s box were still in hi pocket ! he had not thought till then of take them out and hide them ! he had not even thought of them while he wa examin hi cloth ! what next ? instantli he rush to take them out and fling them on the tabl . when he had pull out everyth , and turn the pocket insid out to be sure there wa noth left , he carri the whole heap to the corner . the paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatter . he began stuf all the thing into the hole under the paper : “ they ’ re in ! all out of sight , and the purs too ! ” he thought gleefulli , get up and gaze blankli at the hole which bulg out more than ever . suddenli he shudder all over with horror ; “ my god ! ” he whisper in despair : “ what ’ s the matter with me ? is that hidden ? is that the way to hide thing ? ” he had not reckon on have trinket to hide . he had onli thought of money , and so had not prepar a hiding-plac . “ but now , now , what am i glad of ? ” he thought , “ is that hide thing ? my reason ’ s desert me -- simpli ! ” he sat down on the sofa in exhaust and wa at onc shaken by anoth unbear fit of shiver . mechan he drew from a chair besid him hi old student ’ s winter coat , which wa still warm though almost in rag , cover himself up with it and onc more sank into drowsi and delirium . he lost conscious . not more than five minut had pass when he jump up a second time , and at onc pounc in a frenzi on hi cloth again . “ how could i go to sleep again with noth done ? ye , ye ; i have not taken the loop off the armhol ! i forgot it , forgot a thing like that ! such a piec of evid ! ” he pull off the noos , hurriedli cut it to piec and threw the bit among hi linen under the pillow . “ piec of torn linen couldn ’ t rous suspicion , whatev happen ; i think not , i think not , ani way ! ” he repeat , stand in the middl of the room , and with pain concentr he fell to gaze about him again , at the floor and everywher , tri to make sure he had not forgotten anyth . the convict that all hi faculti , even memori , and the simplest power of reflect were fail him , began to be an insuffer tortur . “ sure it isn ’ t begin alreadi ! sure it isn ’ t my punish come upon me ? it is ! ” the fray rag he had cut off hi trouser were actual lie on the floor in the middl of the room , where anyon come in would see them ! “ what is the matter with me ! ” he cri again , like one distraught . then a strang idea enter hi head ; that , perhap , all hi cloth were cover with blood , that , perhap , there were a great mani stain , but that he did not see them , did not notic them becaus hi percept were fail , were go to piec ... hi reason wa cloud .... suddenli he rememb that there had been blood on the purs too . “ ah ! then there must be blood on the pocket too , for i put the wet purs in my pocket ! ” in a flash he had turn the pocket insid out and , ye ! -- there were trace , stain on the line of the pocket ! “ so my reason ha not quit desert me , so i still have some sens and memori , sinc i guess it of myself , ” he thought triumphantli , with a deep sigh of relief ; “ it ’ s simpli the weak of fever , a moment ’ s delirium , ” and he tore the whole line out of the left pocket of hi trouser . at that instant the sunlight fell on hi left boot ; on the sock which poke out from the boot , he fanci there were trace ! he flung off hi boot ; “ trace inde ! the tip of the sock wa soak with blood ; ” he must have unwarili step into that pool .... “ but what am i to do with thi now ? where am i to put the sock and rag and pocket ? ” he gather them all up in hi hand and stood in the middl of the room . “ in the stove ? but they would ransack the stove first of all . burn them ? but what can i burn them with ? there are no match even . no , better go out and throw it all away somewher . ye , better throw it away , ” he repeat , sit down on the sofa again , “ and at onc , thi minut , without linger ... ” but hi head sank on the pillow instead . again the unbear ici shiver came over him ; again he drew hi coat over him . and for a long while , for some hour , he wa haunt by the impuls to “ go off somewher at onc , thi moment , and fling it all away , so that it may be out of sight and done with , at onc , at onc ! ” sever time he tri to rise from the sofa , but could not . he wa thoroughli wake up at last by a violent knock at hi door . “ open , do , are you dead or aliv ? he keep sleep here ! ” shout nastasya , bang with her fist on the door . “ for whole day togeth he ’ s snore here like a dog ! a dog he is too . open i tell you . it ’ s past ten. ” “ mayb he ’ s not at home , ” said a man ’ s voic . “ ha ! that ’ s the porter ’ s voic .... what doe he want ? ” he jump up and sat on the sofa . the beat of hi heart wa a posit pain . “ then who can have latch the door ? ” retort nastasya . “ he ’ s taken to bolt himself in ! as if he were worth steal ! open , you stupid , wake up ! ” “ what do they want ? whi the porter ? all ’ s discov . resist or open ? come what may ! ... ” he half rose , stoop forward and unlatch the door . hi room wa so small that he could undo the latch without leav the bed . ye ; the porter and nastasya were stand there . nastasya stare at him in a strang way . he glanc with a defiant and desper air at the porter , who without a word held out a grey fold paper seal with bottle-wax . “ a notic from the offic , ” he announc , as he gave him the paper . “ from what offic ? ” “ a summon to the polic offic , of cours . you know which office. ” “ to the polic ? ... what for ? ... ” “ how can i tell ? you ’ re sent for , so you go. ” the man look at him attent , look round the room and turn to go away . “ he ’ s downright ill ! ” observ nastasya , not take her eye off him . the porter turn hi head for a moment . “ he ’ s been in a fever sinc yesterday , ” she ad . raskolnikov made no respons and held the paper in hi hand , without open it . “ don ’ t you get up then , ” nastasya went on compassion , see that he wa let hi feet down from the sofa . “ you ’ re ill , and so don ’ t go ; there ’ s no such hurri . what have you got there ? ” he look ; in hi right hand he held the shred he had cut from hi trouser , the sock , and the rag of the pocket . so he had been asleep with them in hi hand . afterward reflect upon it , he rememb that half wake up in hi fever , he had grasp all thi tightli in hi hand and so fallen asleep again . “ look at the rag he ’ s collect and sleep with them , as though he ha got hold of a treasur ... ” and nastasya went off into her hyster giggl . instantli he thrust them all under hi great coat and fix hi eye intent upon her . far as he wa from be capabl of ration reflect at that moment , he felt that no one would behav like that with a person who wa go to be arrest . “ but ... the polic ? ” “ you ’ d better have some tea ! ye ? i ’ ll bring it , there ’ s some left. ” “ no ... i ’ m go ; i ’ ll go at onc , ” he mutter , get on to hi feet . “ whi , you ’ ll never get downstair ! ” “ ye , i ’ ll go. ” “ as you please. ” she follow the porter out . at onc he rush to the light to examin the sock and the rag . “ there are stain , but not veri notic ; all cover with dirt , and rub and alreadi discolour . no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anyth . nastasya from a distanc could not have notic , thank god ! ” then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notic and began read ; he wa a long while read , befor he understood . it wa an ordinari summon from the district police-st to appear that day at half-past nine at the offic of the district superintend . “ but when ha such a thing happen ? i never have anyth to do with the polic ! and whi just to-day ? ” he thought in agonis bewilder . “ good god , onli get it over soon ! ” he wa fling himself on hi knee to pray , but broke into laughter -- not at the idea of prayer , but at himself . he began , hurriedli dress . “ if i ’ m lost , i am lost , i don ’ t care ! shall i put the sock on ? ” he suddenli wonder , “ it will get dustier still and the trace will be gone. ” but no sooner had he put it on than he pull it off again in loath and horror . he pull it off , but reflect that he had no other sock , he pick it up and put it on again -- and again he laugh . “ that ’ s all convent , that ’ s all rel , mere a way of look at it , ” he thought in a flash , but onli on the top surfac of hi mind , while he wa shudder all over , “ there , i ’ ve got it on ! i have finish by get it on ! ” but hi laughter wa quickli follow by despair . “ no , it ’ s too much for me ... ” he thought . hi leg shook . “ from fear , ” he mutter . hi head swam and ach with fever . “ it ’ s a trick ! they want to decoy me there and confound me over everyth , ” he muse , as he went out on to the stair -- “ the worst of it is i ’ m almost light-head ... i may blurt out someth stupid ... ” on the stair he rememb that he wa leav all the thing just as they were in the hole in the wall , “ and veri like , it ’ s on purpos to search when i ’ m out , ” he thought , and stop short . but he wa possess by such despair , such cynic of miseri , if one may so call it , that with a wave of hi hand he went on . “ onli to get it over ! ” in the street the heat wa insuffer again ; not a drop of rain had fallen all those day . again dust , brick and mortar , again the stench from the shop and pot-hous , again the drunken men , the finnish pedlar and half-broken-down cab . the sun shone straight in hi eye , so that it hurt him to look out of them , and he felt hi head go round -- as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he come out into the street on a bright sunni day . when he reach the turn into _the_ street , in an agoni of trepid he look down it ... at _the_ hous ... and at onc avert hi eye . “ if they question me , perhap i ’ ll simpli tell , ” he thought , as he drew near the police-st . the police-st wa about a quarter of a mile off . it had late been move to new room on the fourth floor of a new hous . he had been onc for a moment in the old offic but long ago . turn in at the gateway , he saw on the right a flight of stair which a peasant wa mount with a book in hi hand . “ a house-port , no doubt ; so then , the offic is here , ” and he began ascend the stair on the chanc . he did not want to ask question of anyon . “ i ’ ll go in , fall on my knee , and confess everyth ... ” he thought , as he reach the fourth floor . the staircas wa steep , narrow and all sloppi with dirti water . the kitchen of the flat open on to the stair and stood open almost the whole day . so there wa a fear smell and heat . the staircas wa crowd with porter go up and down with their book under their arm , policemen , and person of all sort and both sex . the door of the offic , too , stood wide open . peasant stood wait within . there , too , the heat wa stifl and there wa a sicken smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newli decor room . after wait a littl , he decid to move forward into the next room . all the room were small and low-pitch . a fear impati drew him on and on . no one paid attent to him . in the second room some clerk sat write , dress hardli better than he wa , and rather a queer-look set . he went up to one of them . “ what is it ? ” he show the notic he had receiv . “ you are a student ? ” the man ask , glanc at the notic . “ ye , formerli a student. ” the clerk look at him , but without the slightest interest . he wa a particularli unkempt person with the look of a fix idea in hi eye . “ there would be no get anyth out of him , becaus he ha no interest in anyth , ” thought raskolnikov . “ go in there to the head clerk , ” said the clerk , point toward the furthest room . he went into that room -- the fourth in order ; it wa a small room and pack full of peopl , rather better dress than in the outer room . among them were two ladi . one , poorli dress in mourn , sat at the tabl opposit the chief clerk , write someth at hi dictat . the other , a veri stout , buxom woman with a purplish-r , blotchi face , excess smartli dress with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer , wa stand on one side , appar wait for someth . raskolnikov thrust hi notic upon the head clerk . the latter glanc at it , said : “ wait a minut , ” and went on attend to the ladi in mourn . he breath more freeli . “ it can ’ t be that ! ” by degre he began to regain confid , he kept urg himself to have courag and be calm . “ some foolish , some trifl careless , and i may betray myself ! hm ... it ’ s a piti there ’ s no air here , ” he ad , “ it ’ s stifl .... it make one ’ s head dizzier than ever ... and one ’ s mind too ... ” he wa consciou of a terribl inner turmoil . he wa afraid of lose hi self-control ; he tri to catch at someth and fix hi mind on it , someth quit irrelev , but he could not succeed in thi at all . yet the head clerk greatli interest him , he kept hope to see through him and guess someth from hi face . he wa a veri young man , about two and twenti , with a dark mobil face that look older than hi year . he wa fashion dress and foppish , with hi hair part in the middl , well comb and pomad , and wore a number of ring on hi well-scrub finger and a gold chain on hi waistcoat . he said a coupl of word in french to a foreign who wa in the room , and said them fairli correctli . “ luis ivanovna , you can sit down , ” he said casual to the gaily-dress , purple-fac ladi , who wa still stand as though not ventur to sit down , though there wa a chair besid her . “ ich dank , ” said the latter , and softli , with a rustl of silk she sank into the chair . her light blue dress trim with white lace float about the tabl like an air-balloon and fill almost half the room . she smelt of scent . but she wa obvious embarrass at fill half the room and smell so strongli of scent ; and though her smile wa impud as well as cring , it betray evid uneasi . the ladi in mourn had done at last , and got up . all at onc , with some nois , an offic walk in veri jauntili , with a peculiar swing of hi shoulder at each step . he toss hi cockad cap on the tabl and sat down in an easy-chair . the small ladi posit skip from her seat on see him , and fell to curtsi in a sort of ecstasi ; but the offic took not the smallest notic of her , and she did not ventur to sit down again in hi presenc . he wa the assist superintend . he had a reddish moustach that stood out horizont on each side of hi face , and extrem small featur , express of noth much except a certain insol . he look askanc and rather indignantli at raskolnikov ; he wa so veri badli dress , and in spite of hi humili posit , hi bear wa by no mean in keep with hi cloth . raskolnikov had unwarili fix a veri long and direct look on him , so that he felt posit affront . “ what do you want ? ” he shout , appar astonish that such a rag fellow wa not annihil by the majesti of hi glanc . “ i wa summon ... by a notic ... ” raskolnikov falter . “ for the recoveri of money due , from _the student_ , ” the head clerk interf hurriedli , tear himself from hi paper . “ here ! ” and he flung raskolnikov a document and point out the place . “ read that ! ” “ money ? what money ? ” thought raskolnikov , “ but ... then ... it ’ s certainli not _that_. ” and he trembl with joy . he felt sudden intens indescrib relief . a load wa lift from hi back . “ and pray , what time were you direct to appear , sir ? ” shout the assist superintend , seem for some unknown reason more and more aggriev . “ you are told to come at nine , and now it ’ s twelv ! ” “ the notic wa onli brought me a quarter of an hour ago , ” raskolnikov answer loudli over hi shoulder . to hi own surpris he , too , grew suddenli angri and found a certain pleasur in it . “ and it ’ s enough that i have come here ill with fever. ” “ kindli refrain from shout ! ” “ i ’ m not shout , i ’ m speak veri quietli , it ’ s you who are shout at me . i ’ m a student , and allow no one to shout at me. ” the assist superintend wa so furiou that for the first minut he could onli splutter inarticul . he leap up from hi seat . “ be silent ! you are in a govern offic . don ’ t be impud , sir ! ” “ you ’ re in a govern offic , too , ” cri raskolnikov , “ and you ’ re smoke a cigarett as well as shout , so you are show disrespect to all of us. ” he felt an indescrib satisfact at have said thi . the head clerk look at him with a smile . the angri assist superintend wa obvious disconcert . “ that ’ s not your busi ! ” he shout at last with unnatur loud . “ kindli make the declar demand of you . show him . alexandr grigorievitch . there is a complaint against you ! you don ’ t pay your debt ! you ’ re a fine bird ! ” but raskolnikov wa not listen now ; he had eagerli clutch at the paper , in hast to find an explan . he read it onc , and a second time , and still did not understand . “ what is thi ? ” he ask the head clerk . “ it is for the recoveri of money on an i o u , a writ . you must either pay it , with all expens , cost and so on , or give a written declar when you can pay it , and at the same time an undertak not to leav

head clerk look at him with a condescend smile of compass , and at the same time with a certain triumph , as at a novic under fire for the first time -- as though he would say : “ well , how do you feel now ? ” but what did he care now for an i o u , for a writ of recoveri ! wa that worth worri about now , wa it worth attent even ! he stood , he read , he listen , he answer , he even ask question himself , but all mechan . the triumphant sens of secur , of deliver from overwhelm danger , that wa what fill hi whole soul that moment without thought for the futur , without analysi , without supposit or surmis , without doubt and without question . it wa an instant of full , direct , pure instinct joy . but at that veri moment someth like a thunderstorm took place in the offic . the assist superintend , still shaken by raskolnikov ’ s disrespect , still fume and obvious anxiou to keep up hi wound digniti , pounc on the unfortun smart ladi , who had been gaze at him ever sinc he came in with an exceedingli silli smile . “ you shame hussi ! ” he shout suddenli at the top of hi voic .

whi , i have warn you ten time over that i would not let you off the eleventh ! and here you are again , again , you ... you ... ! ” the paper fell out of raskolnikov ’ s hand , and he look wildli at the smart ladi who wa so unceremoni treat . but he soon saw what it meant , and at onc began to find posit amus in the scandal . he listen with pleasur , so that he long to laugh and laugh ... all hi nerv were on edg . “ ilya petrovitch ! ” the head clerk wa begin anxious , but stop short , for he knew from experi that the enrag assist could not be stop except by forc . as for the smart ladi , at first she posit trembl befor the storm . but , strang to say , the more numer and violent the term of abus becam , the more amiabl she look , and the more seduct the smile she lavish on the terribl assist . she move uneasili , and curtsi incessantli , wait impati for a chanc of put in her word : and at last she found it . “ there wa no sort of nois or fight in my hous , mr. captain , ” she patter all at onc , like pea drop , speak russian confid , though with a strong german accent , “ and no sort of scandal , and hi honour came drunk , and it ’ s the whole truth i am tell , mr. captain , and i am not to blame .... mine is an honour hous , mr. captain , and honour behaviour , mr. captain , and i alway , alway dislik ani scandal myself . but he came quit tipsi , and ask for three bottl again , and then he lift up one leg , and began play the pianofort with one foot , and that is not at all right in an honour hous , and he _ganz_ broke the piano , and it wa veri bad manner inde and i said so . and he took up a bottl and began hit everyon with it . and then i call the porter , and karl came , and he took karl and hit him in the eye ; and he hit henriett in the eye , too , and gave me five slap on the cheek . and it wa so ungentlemanli in an honour hous , mr. captain , and i scream . and he open the window over the canal , and stood in the window , squeal like a littl pig ; it wa a disgrac . the idea of squeal like a littl pig at the window into the street ! fie upon him ! and karl pull him away from the window by hi coat , and it is true , mr. captain , he tore _sein rock_ . and then he shout that _man muss_ pay him fifteen roubl damag . and i did pay him , mr. captain , five roubl for _sein rock_ . and he is an ungentlemanli visitor and caus all the scandal . ‘ i will show you up , ’ he said , ‘ for i can write to all the paper about you. ’ ” “ then he wa an author ?

... i am readi to ask pardon , if i have been ill-mann . i am a poor student , sick and shatter ( shatter wa the word he use ) by poverti . i am not studi , becaus i can not keep myself now , but i shall get money .... i have a mother and sister in the provinc of x . they will send it to me , and i will pay . my landladi is a good-heart woman , but she is so exasper at my have lost my lesson , and not pay her for the last four month , that she doe not even send up my dinner ... and i don ’ t understand thi i o u at all . she is ask me to pay her on thi i o u . how am i to pay her ? judg for yourselv ! ... ” “ but that is not our busi , you know , ” the head clerk wa observ . “ ye , ye . i perfectli agre with you . but allow me to explain ... ” raskolnikov put in again , still address nikodim fomitch , but tri hi best to address ilya petrovitch also , though the latter persist appear to be rummag among hi paper and to be contemptu oblivi of him . “ allow me to explain that i have been live with her for nearli three year and at first ... at first ... for whi should i not confess it , at the veri begin i promis to marri her daughter , it wa a verbal promis , freeli given ... she wa a girl ... inde , i like her , though i wa not in love with her ... a youth affair in fact ... that is , i mean to say , that my landladi gave me credit freeli in those day , and i led a life of ... i wa veri heedless ... ” “ nobodi ask you for these person detail , sir , we ’ ve no time to wast , ” ilya petrovitch interpos roughli and with a note of triumph ; but raskolnikov stop him hotli , though he suddenli found it exceedingli difficult to speak . “ but excus me , excus me . it is for me to explain ... how it all happen ... in my turn ... though i agre with you ... it is unnecessari . but a year ago , the girl die of typhu . i remain lodg there as befor , and when my landladi move into her present quarter , she said to me ... and in a friendli way ... that she had complet trust in me , but still , would i not give her an i o u for one hundr and fifteen roubl , all the debt i owe her . she said if onli i gave her that , she would trust me again , as much as i like , and that she would never , never -- those were her own word -- make use of that i o u till i could pay of myself ... and now , when i have lost my lesson and have noth to eat , she take action against me . what am i to say to that ? ” “ all these affect detail are no busi of ours. ” ilya petrovitch interrupt rude . “ you must give a written undertak but as for your love affair and all these tragic event , we have noth to do with that. ” “ come now ... you are harsh , ” mutter nikodim fomitch , sit down at the tabl and also begin to write . he look a littl asham . “ write ! ” said the head clerk to raskolnikov . “ write what ? ” the latter ask , gruffli . “ i will dictat to you. ” raskolnikov fanci that the head clerk treat him more casual and contemptu after hi speech , but strang to say he suddenli felt complet indiffer to anyon ’ s opinion , and thi revuls took place in a flash , in one instant . if he had care to think a littl , he would have been amaz inde that he could have talk to them like that a minut befor , forc hi feel upon them . and where had those feel come from ? now if the whole room had been fill , not with polic offic , but with those nearest and dearest to him , he would not have found one human word for them , so empti wa hi heart . a gloomi sensat of agonis , everlast solitud and remot , took consciou form in hi soul . it wa not the mean of hi sentiment effus befor ilya petrovitch , nor the mean of the latter ’ s triumph over him that had caus thi sudden revuls in hi heart . oh , what had he to do now with hi own base , with all these petti vaniti , offic , german women , debt , police-offic ? if he had been sentenc to be burnt at that moment , he would not have stir , would hardli have heard the sentenc to the end . someth wa happen to him entir new , sudden and unknown . it wa not that he understood , but he felt clearli with all the intens of sensat that he could never more appeal to these peopl in the police-offic with sentiment effus like hi recent outburst , or with anyth whatev ; and that if they had been hi own brother and sister and not police-offic , it would have been utterli out of the question to appeal to them in ani circumst of life . he had never experienc such a strang and aw sensat . and what wa most agonis -- it wa more a sensat than a concept or idea , a direct sensat , the most agonis of all the sensat he had known in hi life . the head clerk began dictat to him the usual form of declar , that he could not pay , that he undertook to do so at a futur date , that he would not leav the town , nor sell hi properti , and so on . “ but you can ’ t write , you can hardli hold the pen , ” observ the head clerk , look with curios at raskolnikov . “ are you ill ? ” “ ye , i am giddi . go on ! ” “ that ’ s all . sign it. ” the head clerk took the paper , and turn to attend to other . raskolnikov gave back the pen ; but instead of get up and go away , he put hi elbow on the tabl and press hi head in hi hand . he felt as if a nail were be driven into hi skull . a strang idea suddenli occur to him , to get up at onc , to go up to nikodim fomitch , and tell him everyth that had happen yesterday , and then to go with him to hi lodg and to show him the thing in the hole in the corner . the impuls wa so strong that he got up from hi seat to carri it out . “ hadn ’ t i better think a minut ? ” flash through hi mind . “ no , better cast off the burden without thinking. ” but all at onc he stood still , root to the spot . nikodim fomitch wa talk eagerli with ilya petrovitch , and the word reach him : “ it ’ s imposs , they ’ ll both be releas . to begin with , the whole stori contradict itself . whi should they have call the porter , if it had been their do ? to inform against themselv ? or as a blind ? no , that would be too cun ! besid , pestryakov , the student , wa seen at the gate by both the porter and a woman as he went in . he wa walk with three friend , who left him onli at the gate , and he ask the porter to direct him , in the presenc of the friend . now , would he have ask hi way if he had been go with such an object ? as for koch , he spent half an hour at the silversmith ’ s below , befor he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactli a quarter to eight . now just consid ... ” “ but excus me , how do you explain thi contradict ? they state themselv that they knock and the door wa lock ; yet three minut later when they went up with the porter , it turn out the door wa unfastened. ” “ that ’ s just it ; the murder must have been there and bolt himself in ; and they ’ d have caught him for a certainti if koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too . _he_ must have seiz the interv to get downstair and slip by them somehow . koch keep cross himself and say : ‘ if i had been there , he would have jump out and kill me with hi axe. ’ he is go to have a thanksgiv servic -- ha , ha ! ” “ and no one saw the murder ? ” “ they might well not see him ; the hous is a regular noah ’ s ark , ” said the head clerk , who wa listen . “ it ’ s clear , quit clear , ” nikodim fomitch repeat warmli . “ no , it is anyth but clear , ” ilya petrovitch maintain . raskolnikov pick up hi hat and walk toward the door , but he did not reach it .... when he recov conscious , he found himself sit in a chair , support by someon on the right side , while someon els wa stand on the left , hold a yellowish glass fill with yellow water , and nikodim fomitch stand befor him , look intent at him . he got up from the chair . “ what ’ s thi ? are you ill ? ” nikodim fomitch ask , rather sharpli . “ he could hardli hold hi pen when he wa sign , ” said the head clerk , settl back in hi place , and take up hi work again . “ have you been ill long ? ” cri ilya petrovitch from hi place , where he , too , wa look through paper . he had , of cours , come to look at the sick man when he faint , but retir at onc when he recov . “ sinc yesterday , ” mutter raskolnikov in repli . “ did you go out yesterday ? ” “ yes. ” “ though you were ill ? ” “ yes. ” “ at what time ? ” “ about seven. ” “ and where did you go , may i ask ? ” “ along the street. ” “ short and clear. ” raskolnikov , white as a handkerchief , had answer sharpli , jerkili , without drop hi black feverish eye befor ilya petrovitch ’ s stare . “ he can scarc stand upright . and you ... ” nikodim fomitch wa begin . “ no matter , ” ilya petrovitch pronounc rather peculiarli . nikodim fomitch would have made some further protest , but glanc at the head clerk who wa look veri hard at him , he did not speak . there wa a sudden silenc . it wa strang . “ veri well , then , ” conclud ilya petrovitch , “ we will not detain you. ” raskolnikov went out . he caught the sound of eager convers on hi departur , and abov the rest rose the question voic of nikodim fomitch . in the street , hi faint pass off complet . “ a search -- there will be a search at onc , ” he repeat to himself , hurri home . “ the brute ! they suspect. ” hi former terror master him complet again . chapter ii “ and what if there ha been a search alreadi ? what if i find them in my room ? ” but here wa hi room . noth and no one in it . no one had peep in . even nastasya had not touch it . but heaven ! how could he have left all those thing in the hole ? he rush to the corner , slip hi hand under the paper , pull the thing out and line hi pocket with them . there were eight articl in all : two littl box with ear-r or someth of the sort , he hardli look to see ; then four small leather case . there wa a chain , too , mere wrap in newspap and someth els in newspap , that look like a decor .... he put them all in the differ pocket of hi overcoat , and the remain pocket of hi trouser , tri to conceal them as much as possibl . he took the purs , too . then he went out of hi room , leav the door open . he walk quickli and resolut , and though he felt shatter , he had hi sens about him . he wa afraid of pursuit , he wa afraid that in anoth half-hour , anoth quarter of an hour perhap , instruct would be issu for hi pursuit , and so at all cost , he must hide all trace befor then . he must clear everyth up while he still had some strength , some reason power left him .... where wa he to go ? that had long been settl : “ fling them into the canal , and all trace hidden in the water , the thing would be at an end. ” so he had decid in the night of hi delirium when sever time he had had the impuls to get up and go away , to make hast , and get rid of it all . but to get rid of it , turn out to be a veri difficult task . he wander along the bank of the ekaterininski canal for half an hour or more and look sever time at the step run down to the water , but he could not think of carri out hi plan ; either raft stood at the step ’ edg , and women were wash cloth on them , or boat were moor there , and peopl were swarm everywher . moreov he could be seen and notic from the bank on all side ; it would look suspici for a man to go down on purpos , stop , and throw someth into the water . and what if the box were to float instead of sink ? and of cours they would . even as it wa , everyon he met seem to stare and look round , as if they had noth to do but to watch him . “ whi is it , or can it be my fanci ? ” he thought . at last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the neva . there were not so mani peopl there , he would be less observ , and it would be more conveni in everi way , abov all it wa further off . he wonder how he could have been wander for a good half-hour , worri and anxiou in thi danger past without think of it befor . and that half-hour he had lost over an irrat plan , simpli becaus he had thought of it in delirium ! he had becom extrem absent and forget and he wa awar of it . he certainli must make hast . he walk toward the neva along v -- -- prospect , but on the way anoth idea struck him . “ whi to the neva ? would it not be better to go somewher far off , to the island again , and there hide the thing in some solitari place , in a wood or under a bush , and mark the spot perhap ? ” and though he felt incap of clear judgment , the idea seem to him a sound one . but he wa not destin to go there . for come out of v -- -- prospect toward the squar , he saw on the left a passag lead between two blank wall to a courtyard . on the right hand , the blank unwhitewash wall of a four-stori hous stretch far into the court ; on the left , a wooden hoard ran parallel with it for twenti pace into the court , and then turn sharpli to the left . here wa a desert fenced-off place where rubbish of differ sort wa lie . at the end of the court , the corner of a low , smutti , stone shed , appar part of some workshop , peep from behind the hoard . it wa probabl a carriag builder ’ s or carpent ’ s shed ; the whole place from the entranc wa black with coal dust . here would be the place to throw it , he thought . not see anyon in the yard , he slip in , and at onc saw near the gate a sink , such as is often put in yard where there are mani workmen or cab-driv ; and on the hoard abov had been scribbl in chalk the time-honour wittic , “ stand here strictli forbidden. ” thi wa all the better , for there would be noth suspici about hi go in . “ here i could throw it all in a heap and get away ! ” look round onc more , with hi hand alreadi in hi pocket , he notic against the outer wall , between the entranc and the sink , a big unhewn stone , weigh perhap sixti pound . the other side of the wall wa a street . he could hear passers-bi , alway numer in that part , but he could not be seen from the entranc , unless someon came in from the street , which might well happen inde , so there wa need of hast . he bent down over the stone , seiz the top of it firmli in both hand , and use all hi strength turn it over . under the stone wa a small hollow in the ground , and he immedi empti hi pocket into it . the purs lay at the top , and yet the hollow wa not fill up . then he seiz the stone again and with one twist turn it back , so that it wa in the same posit again , though it stood a veri littl higher . but he scrape the earth about it and press it at the edg with hi foot . noth could be notic . then he went out , and turn into the squar . again an intens , almost unbear joy overwhelm him for an instant , as it had in the police-offic . “ i have buri my track ! and who , who can think of look under that stone ? it ha been lie there most like ever sinc the hous wa built , and will lie as mani year more . and if it were found , who would think of me ? it is all over ! no clue ! ” and he laugh . ye , he rememb that he began laugh a thin , nervou noiseless laugh , and went on laugh all the time he wa cross the squar . but when he reach the k -- -- boulevard where two day befor he had come upon that girl , hi laughter suddenli ceas . other idea crept into hi mind . he felt all at onc that it would be loathsom to pass that seat on which after the girl wa gone , he had sat and ponder , and that it would be hate , too , to meet that whisker policeman to whom he had given the twenti copeck : “ damn him ! ” he walk , look about him angrili and distractedli . all hi idea now seem to be circl round some singl point , and he felt that there realli wa such a point , and that now , now , he wa left face that point -- and for the first time , inde , dure the last two month . “ damn it all ! ” he thought suddenli , in a fit of ungovern furi . “ if it ha begun , then it ha begun . hang the new life ! good lord , how stupid it is ! ... and what lie i told to-day ! how despic i fawn upon that wretch ilya petrovitch ! but that is all folli ! what do i care for them all , and my fawn upon them ! it is not that at all ! it is not that at all ! ” suddenli he stop ; a new utterli unexpect and exceedingli simpl question perplex and bitterli confound him . “ if it all ha realli been done deliber and not idiot , if i realli had a certain and definit object , how is it i did not even glanc into the purs and don ’ t know what i had there , for which i have undergon these agoni , and have deliber undertaken thi base , filthi degrad busi ? and here i want at onc to throw into the water the purs togeth with all the thing which i had not seen either ... how ’ s that ? ” ye , that wa so , that wa all so . yet he had known it all befor , and it wa not a new question for him , even when it wa decid in the night without hesit and consider , as though so it must be , as though it could not possibl be otherwis .... ye , he had known it all , and understood it all ; it sure had all been settl even yesterday at the moment when he wa bend over the box and pull the jewel-cas out of it .... ye , so it wa . “ it is becaus i am veri ill , ” he decid grimli at last , “ i have been worri and fret myself , and i don ’ t know what i am do .... yesterday and the day befor yesterday and all thi time i have been worri myself .... i shall get well and i shall not worri .... but what if i don ’ t get well at all ? good god , how sick i am of it all ! ” he walk on without rest . he had a terribl long for some distract , but he did not know what to do , what to attempt . a new overwhelm sensat wa gain more and more masteri over him everi moment ; thi wa an immeasur , almost physic , repuls for everyth surround him , an obstin , malign feel of hatr . all who met him were loathsom to him -- he loath their face , their movement , their gestur . if anyon had address him , he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him .... he stop suddenli , on come out on the bank of the littl neva , near the bridg to vassilyevski ostrov . “ whi , he live here , in that hous , ” he thought , “ whi , i have not come to razumihin of my own accord ! here it ’ s the same thing over again .... veri interest to know , though ; have i come on purpos or have i simpli walk here by chanc ? never mind , i said the day befor yesterday that i would go and see him the day _after_ ; well , and so i will ! besid i realli can not go further now. ” he went up to razumihin ’ s room on the fifth floor . the latter wa at home in hi garret , busili write at the moment , and he open the door himself . it wa four month sinc they had seen each other . razumihin wa sit in a rag dressing-gown , with slipper on hi bare feet , unkempt , unshaven and unwash . hi face show surpris . “ is it you ? ” he cri . he look hi comrad up and down ; then after a brief paus , he whistl . “ as hard up as all that ! whi , brother , you ’ ve cut me out ! ” he ad , look at raskolnikov ’ s rag . “ come sit down , you are tire , i ’ ll be bound. ” and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa , which wa in even wors condit than hi own , razumihin saw at onc that hi visitor wa ill. “ whi , you are serious ill , do you know that ? ” he began feel hi puls . raskolnikov pull away hi hand . “ never mind , ” he said , “ i have come for thi : i have no lesson .... i want , ... but i don ’ t realli want lesson .... ” “ but i say ! you are deliri , you know ! ” razumihin observ , watch him care . “ no , i am not. ” raskolnikov got up from the sofa . as he had mount the stair to razumihin ’ s , he had not realis that he would be meet hi friend face to face . now , in a flash , he knew , that what he wa least of all dispos for at that moment wa to be face to face with anyon in the wide world . hi spleen rose within him . he almost choke with rage at himself as soon as he cross razumihin ’ s threshold . “ good-by , ” he said abruptli , and walk to the door . “ stop , stop ! you queer fish. ” “ i don ’ t want to , ” said the other , again pull away hi hand . “ then whi the devil have you come ? are you mad , or what ? whi , thi is ... almost insult ! i won ’ t let you go like that. ” “ well , then , i came to you becaus i know no one but you who could help ... to begin ... becaus you are kinder than anyon -- clever , i mean , and can judg ... and now i see that i want noth . do you hear ? noth at all ... no one ’ s servic ... no one ’ s sympathi . i am by myself ... alon . come , that ’ s enough . leav me alone. ” “ stay a minut , you sweep ! you are a perfect madman . as you like for all i care . i have no lesson , do you see , and i don ’ t care about that , but there ’ s a booksel , heruvimov -- and he take the place of a lesson . i would not exchang him for five lesson . he ’ s do publish of a kind , and issu natur scienc manual and what a circul they have ! the veri titl are worth the money ! you alway maintain that i wa a fool , but by jove , my boy , there are greater fool than i am ! now he is set up for be advanc , not that he ha an inkl of anyth , but , of cours , i encourag him . here are two signatur of the german text -- in my opinion , the crudest charlatan ; it discuss the question , ‘ is woman a human be ? ’ and , of cours , triumphantli prove that she is . heruvimov is go to bring out thi work as a contribut to the woman question ; i am translat it ; he will expand these two and a half signatur into six , we shall make up a gorgeou titl half a page long and bring it out at half a roubl . it will do ! he pay me six roubl the signatur , it work out to about fifteen roubl for the job , and i ’ ve had six alreadi in advanc . when we have finish thi , we are go to begin a translat about whale , and then some of the dullest scandal out of the second part of _le confessions_ we have mark for translat ; somebodi ha told heruvimov , that rousseau wa a kind of radishchev . you may be sure i don ’ t contradict him , hang him ! well , would you like to do the second signatur of ‘ _i woman a human be ? _ ’ if you would , take the german and pen and paper -- all those are provid , and take three roubl ; for as i have had six roubl in advanc on the whole thing , three roubl come to you for your share . and when you have finish the signatur there will be anoth three roubl for you . and pleas don ’ t think i am do you a servic ; quit the contrari , as soon as you came in , i saw how you could help me ; to begin with , i am weak in spell , and secondli , i am sometim utterli adrift in german , so that i make it up as i go along for the most part . the onli comfort is , that it ’ s bound to be a chang for the better . though who can tell , mayb it ’ s sometim for the wors . will you take it ? ” raskolnikov took the german sheet in silenc , took the three roubl and without a word went out . razumihin gaze after him in astonish . but when raskolnikov wa in the next street , he turn back , mount the stair to razumihin ’ s again and lay on the tabl the german articl and the three roubl , went out again , still without utter a word . “ are you rave , or what ? ” razumihin shout , rous to furi at last . “ what farc is thi ? you ’ ll drive me crazi too ... what did you come to see me for , damn you ? ” “ i don ’ t want ... translat , ” mutter raskolnikov from the stair . “ then what the devil do you want ?

” “ anyway , one can ’ t hold one ’ s tongu when one ha a feel , a tangibl feel , that one might be a help if onli .... eh ! do you know the detail of the case ? ” “ i am wait to hear about the painter. ” “ oh , ye ! well , here ’ s the stori . earli on the third day after the murder , when they were still dandl koch and pestryakov -- though they account for everi step they took and it wa as plain as a pikestaff -- an unexpect fact turn up . a peasant call dushkin , who keep a dram-shop face the hous , brought to the polic offic a jewel ’ s case contain some gold ear-r , and told a long rigamarol . ‘ the day befor yesterday , just after eight o ’ clock ’ -- mark the day and the hour ! -- ‘ a journeyman house-paint , nikolay , who had been in to see me alreadi that day , brought me thi box of gold ear-r and stone , and ask me to give him two roubl for them . when i ask him where he got them , he said that he pick them up in the street . i did not ask him anyth more. ’ i am tell you dushkin ’ s stori . ‘ i gave him a note ’ -- a roubl that is -- ‘ for i thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with anoth . it would all come to the same thing -- he ’ d spend it on drink , so the thing had better be with me . the further you hide it the quicker you will find it , and if anyth turn up , if i hear ani rumour , i ’ ll take it to the police. ’ of cours , that ’ s all taradiddl ; he lie like a hors , for i know thi dushkin , he is a pawnbrok and a receiv of stolen good , and he did not cheat nikolay out of a thirty-roubl trinket in order to give it to the polic . he wa simpli afraid . but no matter , to return to dushkin ’ s stori . ‘ i ’ ve known thi peasant , nikolay dementyev , from a child ; he come from the same provinc and district of zaraïsk , we are both ryazan men . and though nikolay is not a drunkard , he drink , and i knew he had a job in that hous , paint work with dmitri , who come from the same villag , too . as soon as he got the roubl he chang it , had a coupl of glass , took hi chang and went out . but i did not see dmitri with him then . and the next day i heard that someon had murder alyona ivanovna and her sister , lizaveta ivanovna , with an axe . i knew them , and i felt suspici about the ear-r at onc , for i knew the murder woman lent money on pledg . i went to the hous , and began to make care inquiri without say a word to anyon . first of all i ask , “ is nikolay here ? ” dmitri told me that nikolay had gone off on the spree ; he had come home at daybreak drunk , stay in the hous about ten minut , and went out again . dmitri didn ’ t see him again and is finish the job alon . and their job is on the same staircas as the murder , on the second floor . when i heard all that i did not say a word to anyon ’ -- that ’ s dushkin ’ s tale -- ‘ but i found out what i could about the murder , and went home feel as suspici as ever . and at eight o ’ clock thi morn ’ -- that wa the third day , you understand -- ‘ i saw nikolay come in , not sober , though not to say veri drunk -- he could understand what wa said to him . he sat down on the bench and did not speak . there wa onli one stranger in the bar and a man i knew asleep on a bench and our two boy . “ have you seen dmitri ? ” said i . “ no , i haven ’ t , ” said he . “ and you ’ ve not been here either ? ” “ not sinc the day befor yesterday , ” said he . “ and where did you sleep last night ? ” “ in peski , with the kolomenski men. ” “ and where did you get those ear-r ? ” i ask . “ i found them in the street , ” and the way he said it wa a bit queer ; he did not look at me . “ did you hear what happen that veri even , at that veri hour , on that same staircas ? ” said i . “ no , ” said he , “ i had not heard , ” and all the while he wa listen , hi eye were stare out of hi head and he turn as white as chalk . i told him all about it and he took hi hat and began get up . i want to keep him . “ wait a bit , nikolay , ” said i , “ won ’ t you have a drink ? ” and i sign to the boy to hold the door , and i came out from behind the bar ; but he dart out and down the street to the turn at a run . i have not seen him sinc . then my doubt were at an end -- it wa hi do , as clear as could be .... ’ ” “ i should think so , ” said zossimov . “ wait ! hear the end . of cours they sought high and low for nikolay ; they detain dushkin and search hi hous ; dmitri , too , wa arrest ; the kolomenski men also were turn insid out . and the day befor yesterday they arrest nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town . he had gone there , taken the silver cross off hi neck and ask for a dram for it . they gave it to him . a few minut afterward the woman went to the cowsh , and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stabl adjoin he had made a noos of hi sash from the beam , stood on a block of wood , and wa tri to put hi neck in the noos . the woman screech her hardest ; peopl ran in . ‘ so that ’ s what you are up to ! ’ ‘ take me , ’ he say , ‘ to such-and-such a polic offic ; i ’ ll confess everything. ’ well , they took him to that polic station -- that is here -- with a suitabl escort . so they ask him thi and that , how old he is , ‘ twenty-two , ’ and so on . at the question , ‘ when you were work with dmitri , didn ’ t you see anyon on the staircas at such-and-such a time ?

’ ‘ i never knew a thing about it . the first i heard of it wa from afanasi pavlovitch the day befor yesterday. ’ ‘ and where did you find the ear-r ? ’ ‘ i found them on the pavement. ’ ‘ whi didn ’ t you go to work with dmitri the other day ?

’ ‘ whi , dmitri and i were paint there all day , and we were just get readi to go , and dmitri took a brush and paint my face , and he ran off and i after him . i ran after him , shout my hardest , and at the bottom of the stair i ran right against the porter and some gentlemen -- and how mani gentlemen were there i don ’ t rememb . and the porter swore at me , and the other porter swore , too , and the porter ’ s wife came out , and swore at us , too ; and a gentleman came into the entri with a ladi , and he swore at us , too , for dmitri and i lay right across the way . i got hold of dmitri ’ s hair and knock him down and began beat him . and dmitri , too , caught me by the hair and began beat me . but we did it all not for temper but in a friendli way , for sport . and then dmitri escap and ran into the street , and i ran after him ; but i did not catch him , and went back to the flat alon ; i had to clear up my thing . i began put them togeth , expect dmitri to come , and there in the passag , in the corner by the door , i step on the box . i saw it lie there wrap up in paper . i took off the paper , saw some littl hook , undid them , and in the box were the ear-r .... ’ ” “ behind the door ?

what ’ s wrong ? ” razumihin , too , got up from hi seat . “ noth , ” raskolnikov answer faintli , turn to the wall . all were silent for a while . “ he must have wake from a dream , ” razumihin said at last , look inquiringli at zossimov . the latter slightli shook hi head . “ well , go on , ” said zossimov . “ what next ? ” “ what next ? as soon as he saw the ear-r , forget dmitri and everyth , he took up hi cap and ran to dushkin and , as we know , got a roubl from him . he told a lie say he found them in the street , and went off drink . he keep repeat hi old stori about the murder : ‘ i know noth of it , never heard of it till the day befor yesterday. ’ ‘ and whi didn ’ t you come to the polic till now ? ’ ‘ i wa frightened. ’ ‘ and whi did you tri to hang yourself ? ’ ‘ from anxiety. ’ ‘ what anxieti ? ’ ‘ that i should be accus of it. ’ well , that ’ s the whole stori . and now what do you suppos they deduc from that ? ” “ whi , there ’ s no suppos . there ’ s a clue , such as it is , a fact . you wouldn ’ t have your painter set free ? ” “ now they ’ ve simpli taken him for the murder . they haven ’ t a shadow of doubt. ” “ that ’ s nonsens . you are excit . but what about the ear-r ? you must admit that , if on the veri same day and hour ear-r from the old woman ’ s box have come into nikolay ’ s hand , they must have come there somehow . that ’ s a good deal in such a case. ” “ how did they get there ? how did they get there ? ” cri razumihin . “ how can you , a doctor , whose duti it is to studi man and who ha more opportun than anyon els for studi human natur -- how can you fail to see the charact of the man in the whole stori ? don ’ t you see at onc that the answer he ha given in the examin are the holi truth ? they came into hi hand precis as he ha told us -- he step on the box and pick it up. ” “ the holi truth ! but didn ’ t he own himself that he told a lie at first ? ” “ listen to me , listen attent . the porter and koch and pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who wa sit in the porter ’ s lodg and the man kryukov , who had just got out of a cab at that minut and went in at the entri with a ladi on hi arm , that is eight or ten wit , agre that nikolay had dmitri on the ground , wa lie on him beat him , while dmitri hung on to hi hair , beat him , too . they lay right across the way , block the thoroughfar . they were sworn at on all side while they ‘ like children ’ ( the veri word of the wit ) were fall over one anoth , squeal , fight and laugh with the funniest face , and , chase one anoth like children , they ran into the street . now take care note . the bodi upstair were warm , you understand , warm when they found them ! if they , or nikolay alon , had murder them and broken open the box , or simpli taken part in the robberi , allow me to ask you one question : do their state of mind , their squeal and giggl and childish scuffl at the gate fit in with axe , bloodsh , fiendish cun , robberi ? they ’ d just kill them , not five or ten minut befor , for the bodi were still warm , and at onc , leav the flat open , know that peopl would go there at onc , fling away their booti , they roll about like children , laugh and attract gener attent . and there are a dozen wit to swear to that ! ” “ of cours it is strang ! it ’ s imposs , inde , but ... ” “ no , brother , no _buts_ . and if the ear-r be found in nikolay ’ s hand at the veri day and hour of the murder constitut an import piec of circumstanti evid against him -- although the explan given by him account for it , and therefor it doe not tell serious against him -- one must take into consider the fact which prove him innoc , especi as they are fact that _cannot be denied_ . and do you suppos , from the charact of our legal system , that they will accept , or that they are in a posit to accept , thi fact -- rest simpli on a psycholog imposs -- as irrefut and conclus break down the circumstanti evid for the prosecut ? no , they won ’ t accept it , they certainli won ’ t , becaus they found the jewel-cas and the man tri to hang himself , ‘ which he could not have done if he hadn ’ t felt guilty. ’ that ’ s the point , that ’ s what excit me , you must understand ! ” “ oh , i see you are excit ! wait a bit . i forgot to ask you ; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman ? ” “ that ’ s been prove , ” said razumihin with appar reluct , frown . “ koch recognis the jewel-cas and gave the name of the owner , who prove conclus that it wa his. ” “ that ’ s bad . now anoth point . did anyon see nikolay at the time that koch and pestryakov were go upstair at first , and is there no evid about that ? ” “ nobodi did see him , ” razumihin answer with vexat . “ that ’ s the worst of it . even koch and pestryakov did not notic them on their way upstair , though , inde , their evid could not have been worth much . they said they saw the flat wa open , and that there must be work go on in it , but they took no special notic and could not rememb whether there actual were men at work in it. ” “ hm ! ... so the onli evid for the defenc is that they were beat one anoth and laugh . that constitut a strong presumpt , but ... how do you explain the fact yourself ? ” “ how do i explain them ? what is there to explain ? it ’ s clear . at ani rate , the direct in which explan is to be sought is clear , and the jewel-cas point to it . the real murder drop those ear-r . the murder wa upstair , lock in , when koch and pestryakov knock at the door . koch , like an ass , did not stay at the door ; so the murder pop out and ran down , too ; for he had no other way of escap . he hid from koch , pestryakov and the porter in the flat when nikolay and dmitri had just run out of it . he stop there while the porter and other were go upstair , wait till they were out of hear , and then went calmli downstair at the veri minut when dmitri and nikolay ran out into the street and there wa no one in the entri ; possibl he wa seen , but not notic . there are lot of peopl go in and out . he must have drop the ear-r out of hi pocket when he stood behind the door , and did not notic he drop them , becaus he had other thing to think of . the jewel-cas is a conclus proof that he did stand there .... that ’ s how i explain it. ” “ too clever ! no , my boy , you ’ re too clever . that beat everything. ” “ but , whi , whi ? ” “ whi , becaus everyth fit too well ... it ’ s too melodramatic. ” “ a-ach ! ” razumihin wa exclaim , but at that moment the door open and a personag came in who wa a stranger to all present . chapter v thi wa a gentleman no longer young , of a stiff and portli appear , and a cautiou and sour counten . he began by stop short in the doorway , stare about him with offens and undisguis astonish , as though ask himself what sort of place he had come to . mistrust and with an affect of be alarm and almost affront , he scan raskolnikov ’ s low and narrow “ cabin. ” with the same amaz he stare at raskolnikov , who lay undress , dishevel , unwash , on hi miser dirti sofa , look fixedli at him . then with the same deliber he scrutinis the uncouth , unkempt figur and unshaven face of razumihin , who look him boldli and inquiringli in the face without rise from hi seat . a constrain silenc last for a coupl of minut , and then , as might be expect , some scene-shift took place . reflect , probabl from certain fairli unmistak sign , that he would get noth in thi “ cabin ” by attempt to overaw them , the gentleman soften somewhat , and civilli , though with some sever , emphasis everi syllabl of hi question , address zossimov : “ rodion romanovitch raskolnikov , a student , or formerli a student ? ” zossimov made a slight movement , and would have answer , had not razumihin anticip him . “ here he is lie on the sofa ! what do you want ? ” thi familiar “ what do you want ” seem to cut the ground from the feet of the pompou gentleman . he wa turn to razumihin , but check himself in time and turn to zossimov again . “ thi is raskolnikov , ” mumbl zossimov , nod toward him . then he gave a prolong yawn , open hi mouth as wide as possibl . then he lazili put hi hand into hi waistcoat-pocket , pull out a huge gold watch in a round hunter ’ s case , open it , look at it and as slowli and lazili proceed to put it back . raskolnikov himself lay without speak , on hi back , gaze persist , though without understand , at the stranger . now that hi face wa turn away from the strang flower on the paper , it wa extrem pale and wore a look of anguish , as though he had just undergon an agonis oper or just been taken from the rack . but the new-com gradual began to arous hi attent , then hi wonder , then suspicion and even alarm . when zossimov said “ thi is raskolnikov ” he jump up quickli , sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant , but weak and break , voic articul : “ ye , i am raskolnikov ! what do you want ? ” the visitor scrutinis him and pronounc impress : “ pyotr petrovitch luzhin . i believ i have reason to hope that my name is not wholli unknown to you ? ” but raskolnikov , who had expect someth quit differ , gaze blankli and dreamili at him , make no repli , as though he heard the name of pyotr petrovitch for the first time . “ is it possibl that you can up to the present have receiv no inform ? ” ask pyotr petrovitch , somewhat disconcert . in repli raskolnikov sank languidli back on the pillow , put hi hand behind hi head and gaze at the ceil . a look of dismay came into luzhin ’ s face . zossimov and razumihin stare at him more inquisit than ever , and at last he show unmistak sign of embarrass . “ i had presum and calcul , ” he falter , “ that a letter post more than ten day , if not a fortnight ago ... ” “ i say , whi are you stand in the doorway ? ” razumihin interrupt suddenli . “ if you ’ ve someth to say , sit down . nastasya and you are so crowd . nastasya , make room . here ’ s a chair , thread your way in ! ” he move hi chair back from the tabl , made a littl space between the tabl and hi knee , and wait in a rather cramp posit for the visitor to “ thread hi way in. ” the minut wa so chosen that it wa imposs to refus , and the visitor squeez hi way through , hurri and stumbl . reach the chair , he sat down , look suspici at razumihin . “ no need to be nervou , ” the latter blurt out . “ rodya ha been ill for the last five day and deliri for three , but now he is recov and ha got an appetit . thi is hi doctor , who ha just had a look at him . i am a comrad of rodya ’ s , like him , formerli a student , and now i am nurs him ; so don ’ t you take ani notic of us , but go on with your business. ” “ thank you . but shall i not disturb the invalid by my presenc and convers ?

i know , and that ’ s enough ! ” there wa no doubt about pyotr petrovitch ’ s be offend thi time , but he said noth . he made a violent effort to understand what it all meant . there wa a moment ’ s silenc . meanwhil raskolnikov , who had turn a littl toward him when he answer , began suddenli stare at him again with mark curios , as though he had not had a good look at him yet , or as though someth new had struck him ; he rose from hi pillow on purpos to stare at him . there certainli wa someth peculiar in pyotr petrovitch ’ s whole appear , someth which seem to justifi the titl of “ fiancé ” so unceremoni appli to him . in the first place , it wa evid , far too much so inde , that pyotr petrovitch had made eager use of hi few day in the capit to get himself up and rig himself out in expect of hi betroth -- a perfectli innoc and permiss proceed , inde . even hi own , perhap too complac , conscious of the agreeabl improv in hi appear might have been forgiven in such circumst , see that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé . all hi cloth were fresh from the tailor ’ s and were all right , except for be too new and too distinctli appropri . even the stylish new round hat had the same signific . pyotr petrovitch treat it too respect and held it too care in hi hand . the exquisit pair of lavend glove , real louvain , told the same tale , if onli from the fact of hi not wear them , but carri them in hi hand for show . light and youth colour predomin in pyotr petrovitch ’ s attir . he wore a charm summer jacket of a fawn shade , light thin trouser , a waistcoat of the same , new and fine linen , a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripe on it , and the best of it wa , thi all suit pyotr petrovitch . hi veri fresh and even handsom face look younger than hi forty-f year at all time . hi dark , mutton-chop whisker made an agreeabl set on both side , grow thickli upon hi shine , clean-shaven chin . even hi hair , touch here and there with grey , though it had been comb and curl at a hairdress ’ s , did not give him a stupid appear , as curl hair usual doe , by inevit suggest a german on hi wedding-day . if there realli wa someth unpleas and repuls in hi rather good-look and impos counten , it wa due to quit other caus . after scan mr. luzhin unceremoni , raskolnikov smile malignantli , sank back on the pillow and stare at the ceil as befor . but mr. luzhin harden hi heart and seem to determin to take no notic of their odditi . “ i feel the greatest regret at find you in thi situat , ” he began , again break the silenc with an effort . “ if i had been awar of your ill i should have come earlier . but you know what busi is . i have , too , a veri import legal affair in the senat , not to mention other preoccup which you may well conjectur . i am expect your mamma and sister ani minute. ” raskolnikov made a movement and seem about to speak ; hi face show some excit . pyotr petrovitch paus , wait , but as noth follow , he went on : “ ... ani minut . i have found a lodg for them on their arrival. ” “ where ?

” she ask . “ later ! i am sleepi ! leav me. ” he turn abruptli to the wall ; nastasya went out . chapter vi but as soon as she went out , he got up , latch the door , undid the parcel which razumihin had brought in that even and had tie up again and began dress . strang to say , he seem immedi to have becom perfectli calm ; not a trace of hi recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunt him of late . it wa the first moment of a strang sudden calm . hi movement were precis and definit ; a firm purpos wa evid in them . “ to-day , to-day , ” he mutter to himself . he understood that he wa still weak , but hi intens spiritu concentr gave him strength and self-confid . he hope , moreov , that he would not fall down in the street . when he had dress in entir new cloth , he look at the money lie on the tabl , and after a moment ’ s thought put it in hi pocket . it wa twenty-f roubl . he took also all the copper chang from the ten roubl spent by razumihin on the cloth . then he softli unlatch the door , went out , slip downstair and glanc in at the open kitchen door . nastasya wa stand with her back to him , blow up the landladi ’ s samovar . she heard noth . who would have dream of hi go out , inde ? a minut later he wa in the street . it wa nearli eight o ’ clock , the sun wa set . it wa as stifl as befor , but he eagerli drank in the stink , dusti town air . hi head felt rather dizzi ; a sort of savag energi gleam suddenli in hi feverish eye and hi wast , pale and yellow face . he did not know and did not think where he wa go , he had one thought onli : “ that all _this_ must be end to-day , onc for all , immedi ; that he would not return home without it , becaus he _would not go on live like that_. ” how , with what to make an end ? he had not an idea about it , he did not even want to think of it . he drove away thought ; thought tortur him . all he knew , all he felt wa that everyth must be chang “ one way or anoth , ” he repeat with desper and immov self-confid and determin . from old habit he took hi usual walk in the direct of the hay market . a dark-hair young man with a barrel organ wa stand in the road in front of a littl gener shop and wa grind out a veri sentiment song . he wa accompani a girl of fifteen , who stood on the pavement in front of him . she wa dress up in a crinolin , a mantl and a straw hat with a flame-colour feather in it , all veri old and shabbi . in a strong and rather agreeabl voic , crack and coarsen by street sing , she sang in hope of get a copper from the shop . raskolnikov join two or three listen , took out a five copeck piec and put it in the girl ’ s hand . she broke off abruptli on a sentiment high note , shout sharpli to the organ grinder “ come on , ” and both move on to the next shop . “ do you like street music ? ” said raskolnikov , address a middle-ag man stand idli by him . the man look at him , startl and wonder . “ i love to hear sing to a street organ , ” said raskolnikov , and hi manner seem strang out of keep with the subject -- “ i like it on cold , dark , damp autumn even -- they must be damp -- when all the passers-bi have pale green , sickli face , or better still when wet snow is fall straight down , when there ’ s no wind -- you know what i mean ? -- and the street lamp shine through it ... ” “ i don ’ t know .... excus me ... ” mutter the stranger , frighten by the question and raskolnikov ’ s strang manner , and he cross over to the other side of the street . raskolnikov walk straight on and came out at the corner of the hay market , where the huckster and hi wife had talk with lizaveta ; but they were not there now . recognis the place , he stop , look round and address a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gape befor a corn chandler ’ s shop . “ isn ’ t there a man who keep a booth with hi wife at thi corner ? ” “ all sort of peopl keep booth here , ” answer the young man , glanc supercili at raskolnikov . “ what ’ s hi name ? ” “ what he wa christened. ” “ aren ’ t you a zaraïski man , too ? which provinc ?

” he cri at last , perplex and impati . “ that ’ s no busi of mine ! what of it ? ” “ the same old woman , ” raskolnikov went on in the same whisper , not heed zametov ’ s explan , “ about whom you were talk in the police-offic , you rememb , when i faint . well , do you understand now ? ” “ what do you mean ? understand ... what ? ” zametov brought out , almost alarm . raskolnikov ’ s set and earnest face wa suddenli transform , and he suddenli went off into the same nervou laugh as befor , as though utterli unabl to restrain himself . and in one flash he recal with extraordinari vivid of sensat a moment in the recent past , that moment when he stood with the axe behind the door , while the latch trembl and the men outsid swore and shook it , and he had a sudden desir to shout at them , to swear at them , to put out hi tongu at them , to mock them , to laugh , and laugh , and laugh ! “ you are either mad , or ... ” began zametov , and he broke off , as though stun by the idea that had suddenli flash into hi mind . “ or ? or what ? what ? come , tell me ! ” “ noth , ” said zametov , get angri , “ it ’ s all nonsens ! ” both were silent . after hi sudden fit of laughter raskolnikov becam suddenli thought and melancholi . he put hi elbow on the tabl and lean hi head on hi hand . he seem to have complet forgotten zametov . the silenc last for some time . “ whi don ’ t you drink your tea ? it ’ s get cold , ” said zametov . “ what ! tea ? oh , ye .... ” raskolnikov sip the glass , put a morsel of bread in hi mouth and , suddenli look at zametov , seem to rememb everyth and pull himself togeth . at the same moment hi face resum it origin mock express . he went on drink tea . “ there have been a great mani of these crime late , ” said zametov . “ onli the other day i read in the _moscow news_ that a whole gang of fals coiner had been caught in moscow . it wa a regular societi . they use to forg ticket ! ” “ oh , but it wa a long time ago ! i read about it a month ago , ” raskolnikov answer calmli . “ so you consid them crimin ? ” he ad , smile . “ of cours they are criminals. ” “ they ? they are children , simpleton , not crimin ! whi , half a hundr peopl meet for such an object -- what an idea ! three would be too mani , and then they want to have more faith in one anoth than in themselv ! one ha onli to blab in hi cup and it all collaps . simpleton ! they engag untrustworthi peopl to chang the note -- what a thing to trust to a casual stranger ! well , let us suppos that these simpleton succeed and each make a million , and what follow for the rest of their live ? each is depend on the other for the rest of hi life ! better hang oneself at onc ! and they did not know how to chang the note either ; the man who chang the note took five thousand roubl , and hi hand trembl . he count the first four thousand , but did not count the fifth thousand -- he wa in such a hurri to get the money into hi pocket and run away . of cours he rous suspicion . and the whole thing came to a crash through one fool ! is it possibl ? ” “ that hi hand trembl ? ” observ zametov , “ ye , that ’ s quit possibl . that , i feel quit sure , is possibl . sometim one can ’ t stand things. ” “ can ’ t stand that ? ” “ whi , could you stand it then ? no , i couldn ’ t . for the sake of a hundr roubl to face such a terribl experi ? to go with fals note into a bank where it ’ s their busi to spot that sort of thing ! no , i should not have the face to do it . would you ? ” raskolnikov had an intens desir again “ to put hi tongu out. ” shiver kept run down hi spine . “ i should do it quit differ , ” raskolnikov began . “ thi is how i would chang the note : i ’ d count the first thousand three or four time backward and forward , look at everi note and then i ’ d set to the second thousand ; i ’ d count that half-way through and then hold some fifty-roubl note to the light , then turn it , then hold it to the light again -- to see whether it wa a good one . ‘ i am afraid , ’ i would say , ‘ a relat of mine lost twenty-f roubl the other day through a fals note , ’ and then i ’ d tell them the whole stori . and after i began count the third , ‘ no , excus me , ’ i would say , ‘ i fanci i made a mistak in the seventh hundr in that second thousand , i am not sure. ’ and so i would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end . and when i had finish , i ’ d pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again , ‘ chang them , pleas , ’ and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me . when i ’ d finish and had gone out , i ’ d come back , ‘ no , excus me , ’ and ask for some explan . that ’ s how i ’ d do it. ” “ foo ! what terribl thing you say ! ” said zametov , laugh . “ but all that is onli talk . i dare say when it came to deed you ’ d make a slip . i believ that even a practis , desper man can not alway reckon on himself , much less you and i . to take an exampl near home -- that old woman murder in our district . the murder seem to have been a desper fellow , he risk everyth in open daylight , wa save by a miracl -- but hi hand shook , too . he did not succeed in rob the place , he couldn ’ t stand it . that wa clear from the ... ” raskolnikov seem offend . “ clear ? whi don ’ t you catch him then ? ” he cri , malici gibe at zametov . “ well , they will catch him. ” “ who ? you ? do you suppos you could catch him ? you ’ ve a tough job ! a great point for you is whether a man is spend money or not . if he had no money and suddenli begin spend , he must be the man . so that ani child can mislead you. ” “ the fact is they alway do that , though , ” answer zametov . “ a man will commit a clever murder at the risk of hi life and then at onc he goe drink in a tavern . they are caught spend money , they are not all as cun as you are . you wouldn ’ t go to a tavern , of cours ? ” raskolnikov frown and look steadili at zametov . “ you seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how i should behav in that case , too ? ” he ask with displeasur . “ i should like to , ” zametov answer firmli and serious . somewhat too much earnest began to appear in hi word and look . “ veri much ? ” “ veri much ! ” “ all right then . thi is how i should behav , ” raskolnikov began , again bring hi face close to zametov ’ s , again stare at him and speak in a whisper , so that the latter posit shudder . “ thi is what i should have done . i should have taken the money and jewel , i should have walk out of there and have gone straight to some desert place with fenc round it and scarc anyon to be seen , some kitchen garden or place of that sort . i should have look out beforehand some stone weigh a hundredweight or more which had been lie in the corner from the time the hous wa built . i would lift that stone -- there would sure to be a hollow under it , and i would put the jewel and money in that hole . then i ’ d roll the stone back so that it would look as befor , would press it down with my foot and walk away . and for a year or two , three mayb , i would not touch it . and , well , they could search ! there ’ d be no trace. ” “ you are a madman , ” said zametov , and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper , and move away from raskolnikov , whose eye were glitter . he had turn fear pale and hi upper lip wa twitch and quiver . he bent down as close as possibl to zametov , and hi lip began to move without utter a word . thi last for half a minut ; he knew what he wa do , but could not restrain himself . the terribl word trembl on hi lip , like the latch on that door ; in anoth moment it will break out , in anoth moment he will let it go , he will speak out . “ and what if it wa i who murder the old woman and lizaveta ? ” he said suddenli and -- realis what he had done . zametov look wildli at him and turn white as the tablecloth . hi face wore a contort smile . “ but is it possibl ? ” he brought out faintli . raskolnikov look wrath at him . “ own up that you believ it , ye , you did ? ” “ not a bit of it , i believ it less than ever now , ” zametov cri hastili . “ i ’ ve caught my cock-sparrow ! so you did believ it befor , if now you believ less than ever ? ” “ not at all , ” cri zametov , obvious embarrass . “ have you been frighten me so as to lead up to thi ? ” “ you don ’ t believ it then ? what were you talk about behind my back when i went out of the police-offic ? and whi did the explos lieuten question me after i faint ? hey , there , ” he shout to the waiter , get up and take hi cap , “ how much ? ” “ thirti copeck , ” the latter repli , run up . “ and there is twenti copeck for vodka . see what a lot of money ! ” he held out hi shake hand to zametov with note in it . “ red note and blue , twenty-f roubl . where did i get them ? and where did my new cloth come from ? you know i had not a copeck . you ’ ve cross-examin my landladi , i ’ ll be bound .... well , that ’ s enough ! _assez causé ! _ till we meet again ! ” he went out , trembl all over from a sort of wild hyster sensat , in which there wa an element of insuffer raptur . yet he wa gloomi and terribl tire . hi face wa twist as after a fit . hi fatigu increas rapidli . ani shock , ani irrit sensat stimul and reviv hi energi at onc , but hi strength fail as quickli when the stimulu wa remov . zametov , left alon , sat for a long time in the same place , plung in thought . raskolnikov had unwittingli work a revolut in hi brain on a certain point and had made up hi mind for him conclus . “ ilya petrovitch is a blockhead , ” he decid . raskolnikov had hardli open the door of the restaur when he stumbl against razumihin on the step . they did not see each other till they almost knock against each other . for a moment they stood look each other up and down . razumihin wa greatli astound , then anger , real anger gleam fierc in hi eye . “ so here you are ! ” he shout at the top of hi voic -- “ you ran away from your bed ! and here i ’ ve been look for you under the sofa ! we went up to the garret . i almost beat nastasya on your account . and here he is after all . rodya ! what is the mean of it ? tell me the whole truth ! confess ! do you hear ? ” “ it mean that i ’ m sick to death of you all and i want to be alon , ” raskolnikov answer calmli . “ alon ? when you are not abl to walk , when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasp for breath ! idiot ! ... what have you been do in the palai de cristal ? own up at onc ! ” “ let me go ! ” said raskolnikov and tri to pass him . thi wa too much for razumihin ; he grip him firmli by the shoulder . “ let you go ? you dare tell me to let you go ? do you know what i ’ ll do with you directli ? i ’ ll pick you up , tie you up in a bundl , carri you home under my arm and lock you up ! ” “ listen , razumihin , ” raskolnikov began quietli , appar calm -- “ can ’ t you see that i don ’ t want your benevol ? a strang desir you have to shower benefit on a man who ... curs them , who feel them a burden in fact ! whi did you seek me out at the begin of my ill ? mayb i wa veri glad to die . didn ’ t i tell you plainli enough to-day that you were tortur me , that i wa ... sick of you ! you seem to want to tortur peopl ! i assur you that all that is serious hinder my recoveri , becaus it ’ s continu irrit me . you saw zossimov went away just now to avoid irrit me . you leav me alon too , for good ’ sake ! what right have you , inde , to keep me by forc ?

whom ? me ? i ’ d twist hi nose off at the mere idea ! potchinkov ’ s hous , 47 , babushkin ’ s flat .... ” “ i shall not come , razumihin. ” raskolnikov turn and walk away . “ i bet you will , ” razumihin shout after him . “ i refus to know you if you don ’ t ! stay , hey , is zametov in there ? ” “ yes. ” “ did you see him ? ” “ yes. ” “ talk to him ? ” “ yes. ” “ what about ? confound you , don ’ t tell me then . potchinkov ’ s hous , 47 , babushkin ’ s flat , rememb ! ” raskolnikov walk on and turn the corner into sadovi street . razumihin look after him thought . then with a wave of hi hand he went into the hous but stop short of the stair . “ confound it , ” he went on almost aloud . “ he talk sensibl but yet ... i am a fool ! as if madmen didn ’ t talk sensibl ! and thi wa just what zossimov seem afraid of. ” he struck hi finger on hi forehead . “ what if ... how could i let him go off alon ?

” he mutter to himself . when they reach the door they heard voic in the room . “ what is it ? ” cri razumihin . raskolnikov wa the first to open the door ; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway , dumbfound . hi mother and sister were sit on hi sofa and had been wait an hour and a half for him . whi had he never expect , never thought of them , though the news that they had start , were on their way and would arriv immedi , had been repeat to him onli that day ? they had spent that hour and a half pli nastasya with question . she wa stand befor them and had told them everyth by now . they were besid themselv with alarm when they heard of hi “ run away ” to-day , ill and , as they understood from her stori , deliri ! “ good heaven , what had becom of him ? ” both had been weep , both had been in anguish for that hour and a half . a cri of joy , of ecstasi , greet raskolnikov ’ s entranc . both rush to him . but he stood like one dead ; a sudden intoler sensat struck him like a thunderbolt . he did not lift hi arm to embrac them , he could not . hi mother and sister clasp him in their arm , kiss him , laugh and cri . he took a step , totter and fell to the ground , faint . anxieti , cri of horror , moan ... razumihin who wa stand in the doorway flew into the room , seiz the sick man in hi strong arm and in a moment had him on the sofa . “ it ’ s noth , noth !

go now .... ” “ but you ’ re out of your mind ! despot ! ” roar razumihin ; but raskolnikov did not and perhap could not answer . he lay down on the sofa , and turn to the wall , utterli exhaust . avdotya romanovna look with interest at razumihin ; her black eye flash ; razumihin posit start at her glanc . pulcheria alexandrovna stood overwhelm . “ noth would induc me to go , ” she whisper in despair to razumihin . “ i will stay somewher here ... escort dounia home. ” “ you ’ ll spoil everyth , ” razumihin answer in the same whisper , lose patienc -- “ come out on to the stair , anyway . nastasya , show a light ! i assur you , ” he went on in a half whisper on the stair -- “ that he wa almost beat the doctor and me thi afternoon ! do you understand ? the doctor himself ! even he gave way and left him , so as not to irrit him . i remain downstair on guard , but he dress at onc and slip off . and he will slip off again if you irrit him , at thi time of night , and will do himself some mischief .... ” “ what are you say ? ” “ and avdotya romanovna can ’ t possibl be left in those lodg without you . just think where you are stay ! that blackguard pyotr petrovitch couldn ’ t find you better lodg ... but you know i ’ ve had a littl to drink , and that ’ s what make me ... swear ; don ’ t mind it .... ” “ but i ’ ll go to the landladi here , ” pulcheria alexandrovna insist , “ i ’ ll beseech her to find some corner for dounia and me for the night . i can ’ t leav him like that , i can not ! ” thi convers took place on the land just befor the landladi ’ s door . nastasya light them from a step below . razumihin wa in extraordinari excit . half an hour earlier , while he wa bring raskolnikov home , he had inde talk too freeli , but he wa awar of it himself , and hi head wa clear in spite of the vast quantiti he had imbib . now he wa in a state border on ecstasi , and all that he had drunk seem to fli to hi head with redoubl effect . he stood with the two ladi , seiz both by their hand , persuad them , and give them reason with astonish plain of speech , and at almost everi word he utter , probabl to emphasis hi argument , he squeez their hand pain as in a vise . he stare at avdotya romanovna without the least regard for good manner . they sometim pull their hand out of hi huge boni paw , but far from notic what wa the matter , he drew them all the closer to him . if they ’ d told him to jump head foremost from the staircas , he would have done it without thought or hesit in their servic . though pulcheria alexandrovna felt that the young man wa realli too eccentr and pinch her hand too much , in her anxieti over her rodya she look on hi presenc as providenti , and wa unwil to notic all hi peculiar . but though avdotya romanovna share her anxieti , and wa not of timor disposit , she could not see the glow light in hi eye without wonder and almost alarm . it wa onli the unbound confid inspir by nastasya ’ s account of her brother ’ s queer friend , which prevent her from tri to run away from him , and to persuad her mother to do the same . she realis , too , that even run away wa perhap imposs now . ten minut later , howev , she wa consider reassur ; it wa characterist of razumihin that he show hi true natur at onc , whatev mood he might be in , so that peopl quickli saw the sort of man they had to deal with . “ you can ’ t go to the landladi , that ’ s perfect nonsens ! ” he cri . “ if you stay , though you are hi mother , you ’ ll drive him to a frenzi , and then good know what will happen ! listen , i ’ ll tell you what i ’ ll do : nastasya will stay with him now , and i ’ ll conduct you both home , you can ’ t be in the street alon ; petersburg is an aw place in that way .... but no matter ! then i ’ ll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later , on my word of honour , i ’ ll bring you news how he is , whether he is asleep , and all that . then , listen ! then i ’ ll run home in a twinkl -- i ’ ve a lot of friend there , all drunk -- i ’ ll fetch zossimov -- that ’ s the doctor who is look after him , he is there , too , but he is not drunk ; he is not drunk , he is never drunk ! i ’ ll drag him to rodya , and then to you , so that you ’ ll get two report in the hour -- from the doctor , you understand , from the doctor himself , that ’ s a veri differ thing from my account of him ! if there ’ s anyth wrong , i swear i ’ ll bring you here myself , but , if it ’ s all right , you go to bed . and i ’ ll spend the night here , in the passag , he won ’ t hear me , and i ’ ll tell zossimov to sleep at the landladi ’ s , to be at hand . which is better for him : you or the doctor ? so come home then ! but the landladi is out of the question ; it ’ s all right for me , but it ’ s out of the question for you : she wouldn ’ t take you , for she ’ s ... for she ’ s a fool ... she ’ d be jealou on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you , too , if you want to know ... of avdotya romanovna certainli . she is an absolut , absolut unaccount charact ! but i am a fool , too ! ... no matter ! come along ! do you trust me ? come , do you trust me or not ? ” “ let us go , mother , ” said avdotya romanovna , “ he will certainli do what he ha promis . he ha save rodya alreadi , and if the doctor realli will consent to spend the night here , what could be better ? ” “ you see , you ... you ... understand me , becaus you are an angel ! ” razumihin cri in ecstasi , “ let us go ! nastasya ! fli upstair and sit with him with a light ; i ’ ll come in a quarter of an hour. ” though pulcheria alexandrovna wa not perfectli convinc , she made no further resist . razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stair . he still made her uneasi , as though he wa compet and good-natur , wa he capabl of carri out hi promis ? he seem in such a condit .... “ ah , i see you think i am in such a condit ! ” razumihin broke in upon her thought , guess them , as he stroll along the pavement with huge step , so that the two ladi could hardli keep up with him , a fact he did not observ , howev . “ nonsens ! that is ... i am drunk like a fool , but that ’ s not it ; i am not drunk from wine . it ’ s see you ha turn my head ... but don ’ t mind me ! don ’ t take ani notic : i am talk nonsens , i am not worthi of you .... i am utterli unworthi of you ! the minut i ’ ve taken you home , i ’ ll pour a coupl of pail of water over my head in the gutter here , and then i shall be all right .... if onli you knew how i love you both ! don ’ t laugh , and don ’ t be angri ! you may be angri with anyon , but not with me ! i am hi friend , and therefor i am your friend , too , i want to be ... i had a presenti ... last year there wa a moment ... though it wasn ’ t a presenti realli , for you seem to have fallen from heaven . and i expect i shan ’ t sleep all night ... zossimov wa afraid a littl time ago that he would go mad ... that ’ s whi he mustn ’ t be irritated. ” “ what do you say ? ” cri the mother . “ did the doctor realli say that ? ” ask avdotya romanovna , alarm . “ ye , but it ’ s not so , not a bit of it . he gave him some medicin , a powder , i saw it , and then your come here .... ah !

it wa natur enough that a warm , open , simple-heart , honest giant like razumihin , who had never seen anyon like her and wa not quit sober at the time , should lose hi head immedi . besid , as chanc would have it , he saw dounia for the first time transfigur by her love for her brother and her joy at meet him . afterward he saw her lower lip quiver with indign at her brother ’ s insol , cruel and ungrat word -- and hi fate wa seal . he had spoken the truth , moreov , when he blurt out in hi drunken talk on the stair that praskovya pavlovna , raskolnikov ’ s eccentr landladi , would be jealou of pulcheria alexandrovna as well as of avdotya romanovna on hi account . although pulcheria alexandrovna wa forty-thre , her face still retain trace of her former beauti ; she look much younger than her age , inde , which is almost alway the case with women who retain seren of spirit , sensit and pure sincer warmth of heart to old age . we may add in parenthesi that to preserv all thi is the onli mean of retain beauti to old age . her hair had begun to grow grey and thin , there had long been littl crow ’ s foot wrinkl round her eye , her cheek were hollow and sunken from anxieti and grief , and yet it wa a handsom face . she wa dounia over again , twenti year older , but without the project underlip . pulcheria alexandrovna wa emot , but not sentiment , timid and yield , but onli to a certain point . she could give way and accept a great deal even of what wa contrari to her convict , but there wa a certain barrier fix by honesti , principl and the deepest convict which noth would induc her to cross . exactli twenti minut after razumihin ’ s departur , there came two subdu but hurri knock at the door : he had come back . “ i won ’ t come in , i haven ’ t time , ” he hasten to say when the door wa open . “ he sleep like a top , soundli , quietli , and god grant he may sleep ten hour . nastasya ’ s with him ; i told her not to leav till i came . now i am fetch zossimov , he will report to you and then you ’ d better turn in ; i can see you are too tire to do anyth .... ” and he ran off down the corridor . “ what a veri compet and ... devot young man !

what wa the date ? it doesn ’ t matter though , i will find it . think of not tell us ! ” “ how did you find out that the articl wa mine ? it ’ s onli sign with an initial. ” “ i onli learnt it by chanc , the other day . through the editor ; i know him .... i wa veri much interested. ” “ i analys , if i rememb , the psycholog of a crimin befor and after the crime. ” “ ye , and you maintain that the perpetr of a crime is alway accompani by ill . veri , veri origin , but ... it wa not that part of your articl that interest me so much , but an idea at the end of the articl which i regret to say you mere suggest without work it out clearli . there is , if you recollect , a suggest that there are certain person who can ... that is , not precis are abl to , but have a perfect right to commit breach of moral and crime , and that the law is not for them. ” raskolnikov smile at the exagger and intent distort of hi idea . “ what ? what do you mean ? a right to crime ? but not becaus of the influenc of environ ? ” razumihin inquir with some alarm even . “ no , not exactli becaus of it , ” answer porfiri . “ in hi articl all men are divid into ‘ ordinari ’ and ‘ extraordinary. ’ ordinari men have to live in submiss , have no right to transgress the law , becaus , don ’ t you see , they are ordinari . but extraordinari men have a right to commit ani crime and to transgress the law in ani way , just becaus they are extraordinari . that wa your idea , if i am not mistaken ? ” “ what do you mean ? that can ’ t be right ? ” razumihin mutter in bewilder . raskolnikov smile again . he saw the point at onc , and knew where they want to drive him . he decid to take up the challeng . “ that wasn ’ t quit my content , ” he began simpli and modestli . “ yet i admit that you have state it almost correctli ; perhap , if you like , perfectli so. ” ( it almost gave him pleasur to admit thi . ) “ the onli differ is that i don ’ t contend that extraordinari peopl are alway bound to commit breach of moral , as you call it . in fact , i doubt whether such an argument could be publish . i simpli hint that an ‘ extraordinari ’ man ha the right ... that is not an offici right , but an inner right to decid in hi own conscienc to overstep ... certain obstacl , and onli in case it is essenti for the practic fulfil of hi idea ( sometim , perhap , of benefit to the whole of human ) . you say that my articl isn ’ t definit ; i am readi to make it as clear as i can . perhap i am right in think you want me to ; veri well . i maintain that if the discoveri of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrif the live of one , a dozen , a hundr , or more men , newton would have had the right , would inde have been in duty-bound ... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundr men for the sake of make hi discoveri known to the whole of human . but it doe not follow from that that newton had a right to murder peopl right and left and to steal everi day in the market . then , i rememb , i maintain in my articl that all ... well , legisl and leader of men , such as lycurgu , solon , mahomet , napoleon , and so on , were all without except crimin , from the veri fact that , make a new law , they transgress the ancient one , hand down from their ancestor and held sacr by the peopl , and they did not stop short at bloodsh either , if that bloodsh -- often of innoc person fight brave in defenc of ancient law -- were of use to their caus . it ’ s remark , in fact , that the major , inde , of these benefactor and leader of human were guilti of terribl carnag . in short , i maintain that all great men or even men a littl out of the common , that is to say capabl of give some new word , must from their veri natur be crimin -- more or less , of cours . otherwis it ’ s hard for them to get out of the common rut ; and to remain in the common rut is what they can ’ t submit to , from their veri natur again , and to my mind they ought not , inde , to submit to it . you see that there is noth particularli new in all that . the same thing ha been print and read a thousand time befor . as for my divis of peopl into ordinari and extraordinari , i acknowledg that it ’ s somewhat arbitrari , but i don ’ t insist upon exact number . i onli believ in my lead idea that men are _in general_ divid by a law of natur into two categori , inferior ( ordinari ) , that is , so to say , materi that serv onli to reproduc it kind , and men who have the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_ . there are , of cours , innumer sub-divis , but the distinguish featur of both categori are fairli well mark . the first categori , gener speak , are men conserv in tempera and law-abid ; they live under control and love to be control . to my think it is their duti to be control , becaus that ’ s their vocat , and there is noth humili in it for them . the second categori all transgress the law ; they are destroy or dispos to destruct accord to their capac . the crime of these men are of cours rel and vari ; for the most part they seek in veri vari way the destruct of the present for the sake of the better . but if such a one is forc for the sake of hi idea to step over a corps or wade through blood , he can , i maintain , find within himself , in hi conscienc , a sanction for wade through blood -- that depend on the idea and it dimens , note that . it ’ s onli in that sens i speak of their right to crime in my articl ( you rememb it began with the legal question ) . there ’ s no need for such anxieti , howev ; the mass will scarc ever admit thi right , they punish them or hang them ( more or less ) , and in do so fulfil quit justli their conserv vocat . but the same mass set these crimin on a pedest in the next gener and worship them ( more or less ) . the first categori is alway the man of the present , the second the man of the futur . the first preserv the world and peopl it , the second move the world and lead it to it goal . each class ha an equal right to exist . in fact , all have equal right with me -- and _vive la guerr éternelle_ -- till the new jerusalem , of cours ! ” “ then you believ in the new jerusalem , do you ? ” “ i do , ” raskolnikov answer firmli ; as he said these word and dure the whole preced tirad he kept hi eye on one spot on the carpet . “ and ... and do you believ in god ? excus my curiosity. ” “ i do , ” repeat raskolnikov , rais hi eye to porfiri . “ and ... do you believ in lazaru ’ rise from the dead ? ” “ i ... i do . whi do you ask all thi ? ” “ you believ it liter ? ” “ literally. ” “ you don ’ t say so .... i ask from curios . excus me . but let us go back to the question ; they are not alway execut . some , on the contrari ... ” “ triumph in their lifetim ? oh , ye , some attain their end in thi life , and then ... ” “ they begin execut other peopl ? ” “ if it ’ s necessari ; inde , for the most part they do . your remark is veri witty. ” “ thank you . but tell me thi : how do you distinguish those extraordinari peopl from the ordinari one ? are there sign at their birth ? i feel there ought to be more exactitud , more extern definit . excus the natur anxieti of a practic law-abid citizen , but couldn ’ t they adopt a special uniform , for instanc , couldn ’ t they wear someth , be brand in some way ? for you know if confus aris and a member of one categori imagin that he belong to the other , begin to ‘ elimin obstacl ’ as you so happili express it , then ... ” “ oh , that veri often happen ! that remark is wittier than the other. ” “ thank you. ” “ no reason to ; but take note that the mistak can onli aris in the first categori , that is among the ordinari peopl ( as i perhap unfortun call them ) . in spite of their predisposit to obedi veri mani of them , through a play of natur , sometim vouchsaf even to the cow , like to imagin themselv advanc peopl , ‘ destroy , ’ and to push themselv into the ‘ new movement , ’ and thi quit sincer . meanwhil the realli _new_ peopl are veri often unobserv by them , or even despis as reactionari of grovel tendenc . but i don ’ t think there is ani consider danger here , and you realli need not be uneasi for they never go veri far . of cours , they might have a thrash sometim for let their fanci run away with them and to teach them their place , but no more ; in fact , even thi isn ’ t necessari as they castig themselv , for they are veri conscienti : some perform thi servic for one anoth and other chastis themselv with their own hand .... they will impos variou public act of penit upon themselv with a beauti and edifi effect ; in fact you ’ ve noth to be uneasi about .... it ’ s a law of nature. ” “ well , you have certainli set my mind more at rest on that score ; but there ’ s anoth thing worri me . tell me , pleas , are there mani peopl who have the right to kill other , these extraordinari peopl ? i am readi to bow down to them , of cours , but you must admit it ’ s alarm if there are a great mani of them , eh ? ” “ oh , you needn ’ t worri about that either , ” raskolnikov went on in the same tone . “ peopl with new idea , peopl with the faintest capac for say someth _new_ , are extrem few in number , extraordinarili so in fact . one thing onli is clear , that the appear of all these grade and sub-divis of men must follow with unfail regular some law of natur . that law , of cours , is unknown at present , but i am convinc that it exist , and one day may becom known . the vast mass of mankind is mere materi , and onli exist in order by some great effort , by some mysteri process , by mean of some cross of race and stock , to bring into the world at last perhap one man out of a thousand with a spark of independ . one in ten thousand perhap -- i speak roughli , approxim -- is born with some independ , and with still greater independ one in a hundr thousand . the man of geniu is one of million , and the great genius , the crown of human , appear on earth perhap one in mani thousand million . in fact i have not peep into the retort in which all thi take place . but there certainli is and must be a definit law , it can not be a matter of chance. ” “ whi , are you both joke ? ” razumihin cri at last . “ there you sit , make fun of one anoth . are you seriou , rodya ? ” raskolnikov rais hi pale and almost mourn face and made no repli . and the unconc , persist , nervou , and _discourteous_ sarcasm of porfiri seem strang to razumihin besid that quiet and mourn face . “ well , brother , if you are realli seriou ... you are right , of cours , in say that it ’ s not new , that it ’ s like what we ’ ve read and heard a thousand time alreadi ; but what is realli origin in all thi , and is exclus your own , to my horror , is that you sanction bloodsh _in the name of conscience_ , and , excus my say so , with such fanatic .... that , i take it , is the point of your articl . but that sanction of bloodsh _bi conscience_ is to my mind ... more terribl than the offici , legal sanction of bloodsh .... ” “ you are quit right , it is more terribl , ” porfiri agre . “ ye , you must have exagger ! there is some mistak , i shall read it . you can ’ t think that ! i shall read it. ” “ all that is not in the articl , there ’ s onli a hint of it , ” said raskolnikov . “ ye , yes. ” porfiri couldn ’ t sit still . “ your attitud to crime is pretti clear to me now , but ... excus me for my impertin ( i am realli asham to be worri you like thi ) , you see , you ’ ve remov my anxieti as to the two grade get mix , but ... there are variou practic possibl that make me uneasi ! what if some man or youth imagin that he is a lycurgu or mahomet -- a futur one of cours -- and suppos he begin to remov all obstacl .... he ha some great enterpris befor him and need money for it ... and tri to get it ... do you see ? ” zametov gave a sudden guffaw in hi corner . raskolnikov did not even rais hi eye to him . “ i must admit , ” he went on calmli , “ that such case certainli must aris . the vain and foolish are particularli apt to fall into that snare ; young peopl especially. ” “ ye , you see . well then ? ” “ what then ? ” raskolnikov smile in repli ; “ that ’ s not my fault . so it is and so it alway will be . he said just now ( he nod at razumihin ) that i sanction bloodsh . societi is too well protect by prison , banish , crimin investig , penal servitud . there ’ s no need to be uneasi . you have but to catch the thief. ” “ and what if we do catch him ? ” “ then he get what he deserves. ” “ you are certainli logic . but what of hi conscienc ? ” “ whi do you care about that ? ” “ simpli from humanity. ” “ if he ha a conscienc he will suffer for hi mistak . that will be hi punish -- as well as the prison. ” “ but the real genius , ” ask razumihin frown , “ those who have the right to murder ? oughtn ’ t they to suffer at all even for the blood they ’ ve shed ? ” “ whi the word _ought_ ? it ’ s not a matter of permiss or prohibit . he will suffer if he is sorri for hi victim . pain and suffer are alway inevit for a larg intellig and a deep heart . the realli great men must , i think , have great sad on earth , ” he ad dreamili , not in the tone of the convers . he rais hi eye , look earnestli at them all , smile , and took hi cap . he wa too quiet by comparison with hi manner at hi entranc , and he felt thi . everyon got up . “ well , you may abus me , be angri with me if you like , ” porfiri petrovitch began again , “ but i can ’ t resist . allow me one littl question ( i know i am troubl you ) . there is just one littl notion i want to express , simpli that i may not forget it. ” “ veri good , tell me your littl notion , ” raskolnikov stood wait , pale and grave befor him . “ well , you see ... i realli don ’ t know how to express it properli .... it ’ s a play , psycholog idea .... when you were write your articl , sure you couldn ’ t have help , he-h ! fanci yourself ... just a littl , an ‘ extraordinari ’ man , utter a _new word_ in your sens .... that ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? ” “ quit possibl , ” raskolnikov answer contemptu . razumihin made a movement . “ and , if so , could you bring yourself in case of worldli difficulti and hardship or for some servic to human -- to overstep obstacl ? ... for instanc , to rob and murder ? ” and again he wink with hi left eye , and laugh noiselessli just as befor . “ if i did i certainli should not tell you , ” raskolnikov answer with defiant and haughti contempt . “ no , i wa onli interest on account of your articl , from a literari point of view ... ” “ foo ! how obviou and insol that is ! ” raskolnikov thought with repuls . “ allow me to observ , ” he answer dryli , “ that i don ’ t consid myself a mahomet or a napoleon , nor ani personag of that kind , and not be one of them i can not tell you how i should act. ” “ oh , come , don ’ t we all think ourselv napoleon now in russia ? ” porfiri petrovitch said with alarm familiar . someth peculiar betray itself in the veri inton of hi voic . “ perhap it wa one of these futur napoleon who did for alyona ivanovna last week ? ” zametov blurt out from the corner . raskolnikov did not speak , but look firmli and intent at porfiri . razumihin wa scowl gloomili . he seem befor thi to be notic someth . he look angrili around . there wa a minut of gloomi silenc . raskolnikov turn to go . “ are you go alreadi ? ” porfiri said amiabl , hold out hi hand with excess polit . “ veri , veri glad of your acquaint . as for your request , have no uneasi , write just as i told you , or , better still , come to me there yourself in a day or two ... to-morrow , inde . i shall be there at eleven o ’ clock for certain . we ’ ll arrang it all ; we ’ ll have a talk . as one of the last to be _there_ , you might perhap be abl to tell us someth , ” he ad with a most good-natur express . “ you want to cross-examin me offici in due form ? ” raskolnikov ask sharpli . “ oh , whi ? that ’ s not necessari for the present . you misunderstand me . i lose no opportun , you see , and ... i ’ ve talk with all who had pledg .... i obtain evid from some of them , and you are the last .... ye , by the way , ” he cri , seemingli suddenli delight , “ i just rememb , what wa i think of ? ” he turn to razumihin , “ you were talk my ear off about that nikolay ... of cours , i know , i know veri well , ” he turn to raskolnikov , “ that the fellow is innoc , but what is one to do ? we had to troubl dmitri too .... thi is the point , thi is all : when you went up the stair it wa past seven , wasn ’ t it ? ” “ ye , ” answer raskolnikov , with an unpleas sensat at the veri moment he spoke that he need not have said it . “ then when you went upstair between seven and eight , didn ’ t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey , do you rememb ? two workmen or at least one of them ? they were paint there , didn ’ t you notic them ? it ’ s veri , veri import for them. ” “ painter ? no , i didn ’ t see them , ” raskolnikov answer slowli , as though ransack hi memori , while at the same instant he wa rack everi nerv , almost swoon with anxieti to conjectur as quickli as possibl where the trap lay and not to overlook anyth . “ no , i didn ’ t see them , and i don ’ t think i notic a flat like that open .... but on the fourth storey ” ( he had master the trap now and wa triumphant ) “ i rememb now that someon wa move out of the flat opposit alyona ivanovna ’ s .... i rememb ... i rememb it clearli . some porter were carri out a sofa and they squeez me against the wall . but painter ... no , i don ’ t rememb that there were ani painter , and i don ’ t think that there wa a flat open anywher , no , there wasn ’ t. ” “ what do you mean ? ” razumihin shout suddenli , as though he had reflect and realis . “ whi , it wa on the day of the murder the painter were at work , and he wa there three day befor ? what are you ask ? ” “ foo ! i have muddl it ! ” porfiri slap himself on the forehead . “ deuc take it ! thi busi is turn my brain ! ” he address raskolnikov somewhat apologet . “ it would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyon had seen them between seven and eight at the flat , so i fanci you could perhap have told us someth .... i quit muddl it. ” “ then you should be more care , ” razumihin observ grimli . the last word were utter in the passag . porfiri petrovitch saw them to the door with excess polit . they went out into the street gloomi and sullen , and for some step they did not say a word . raskolnikov drew a deep breath . chapter vi “ i don ’ t believ it , i can ’ t believ it ! ” repeat razumihin , tri in perplex to refut raskolnikov ’ s argument . they were by now approach bakaleyev ’ s lodg , where pulcheria alexandrovna and dounia had been expect them a long while . razumihin kept stop on the way in the heat of discuss , confus and excit by the veri fact that they were for the first time speak openli about _it_ . “ don ’ t believ it , then ! ” answer raskolnikov , with a cold , careless smile . “ you were notic noth as usual , but i wa weigh everi word. ” “ you are suspici . that is whi you weigh their word ... h ’ m ... certainli , i agre , porfiri ’ s tone wa rather strang , and still more that wretch zametov ! ... you are right , there wa someth about him -- but whi ? whi ? ” “ he ha chang hi mind sinc last night. ” “ quit the contrari ! if they had that brainless idea , they would do their utmost to hide it , and conceal their card , so as to catch you afterward .... but it wa all impud and careless. ” “ if they had had fact -- i mean , real fact -- or at least ground for suspicion , then they would certainli have tri to hide their game , in the hope of get more ( they would have made a search long ago besid ) . but they have no fact , not one . it is all mirag -- all ambigu . simpli a float idea . so they tri to throw me out by impud . and perhap , he wa irrit at have no fact , and blurt it out in hi vexat -- or perhap he ha some plan ... he seem an intellig man . perhap he want to frighten me by pretend to know . they have a psycholog of their own , brother . but it is loathsom explain it all . stop ! ” “ and it ’ s insult , insult ! i understand you . but ... sinc we have spoken openli now ( and it is an excel thing that we have at last -- i am glad ) i will own now frankli that i notic it in them long ago , thi idea . of cours the merest hint onli -- an insinu -- but whi an insinu even ? how dare they ? what foundat have they ? if onli you knew how furiou i have been . think onli ! simpli becaus a poor student , unhing by poverti and hypochondria , on the eve of a sever deliri ill ( note that ) , suspici , vain , proud , who ha not seen a soul to speak to for six month , in rag and in boot without sole , ha to face some wretch policemen and put up with their insol ; and the unexpect debt thrust under hi nose , the i.o.u . present by tchebarov , the new paint , thirti degre reaumur and a stifl atmospher , a crowd of peopl , the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just befor , and all that on an empti stomach -- he might well have a faint fit ! and that , that is what they found it all on ! damn them ! i understand how annoy it is , but in your place , rodya , i would laugh at them , or better still , spit in their ugli face , and spit a dozen time in all direct . i ’ d hit out in all direct , neatli too , and so i ’ d put an end to it . damn them ! don ’ t be downheart . it ’ s a shame ! ” “ he realli ha put it well , though , ” raskolnikov thought . “ damn them ? but the cross-examin again , to-morrow ? ” he said with bitter . “ must i realli enter into explan with them ? i feel vex as it is , that i condescend to speak to zametov yesterday in the restaur .... ” “ damn it ! i will go myself to porfiri . i will squeez it out of him , as one of the famili : he must let me know the in and out of it all ! and as for zametov ... ” “ at last he see through him ! ” thought raskolnikov . “ stay ! ” cri razumihin , seiz him by the shoulder again . “ stay ! you were wrong . i have thought it out . you are wrong ! how wa that a trap ? you say that the question about the workmen wa a trap . but if you had done _that_ , could you have said you had seen them paint the flat ... and the workmen ? on the contrari , you would have seen noth , even if you had seen it . who would own it against himself ? ” “ if i had done _that thing_ , i should certainli have said that i had seen the workmen and the flat , ” raskolnikov answer , with reluct and obviou disgust . “ but whi speak against yourself ? ” “ becaus onli peasant , or the most inexperienc novic deni everyth flatli at examin . if a man is ever so littl develop and experienc , he will certainli tri to admit all the extern fact that can ’ t be avoid , but will seek other explan of them , will introduc some special , unexpect turn , that will give them anoth signific and put them in anoth light . porfiri might well reckon that i should be sure to answer so , and say i had seen them to give an air of truth , and then make some explanation. ” “ but he would have told you at onc that the workmen could not have been there two day befor , and that therefor you must have been there on the day of the murder at eight o ’ clock . and so he would have caught you over a detail. ” “ ye , that is what he wa reckon on , that i should not have time to reflect , and should be in a hurri to make the most like answer , and so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two day before. ” “ but how could you forget it ? ” “ noth easier . it is in just such stupid thing clever peopl are most easili caught . the more cun a man is , the less he suspect that he will be caught in a simpl thing . the more cun a man is , the simpler the trap he must be caught in . porfiri is not such a fool as you think .... ” “ he is a knave then , if that is so ! ” raskolnikov could not help laugh . but at the veri moment , he wa struck by the strang of hi own frank , and the eager with which he had made thi explan , though he had kept up all the preced convers with gloomi repuls , obvious with a motiv , from necess . “ i am get a relish for certain aspect ! ” he thought to himself . but almost at the same instant he becam suddenli uneasi , as though an unexpect and alarm idea had occur to him . hi uneasi kept on increas . they had just reach the entranc to bakaleyev ’ s . “ go in alon ! ” said raskolnikov suddenli . “ i will be back directly. ” “ where are you go ? whi , we are just here. ” “ i can ’ t help it .... i will come in half an hour . tell them. ” “ say what you like , i will come with you. ” “ you , too , want to tortur me ! ” he scream , with such bitter irrit , such despair in hi eye that razumihin ’ s hand drop . he stood for some time on the step , look gloomili at raskolnikov stride rapidli away in the direct of hi lodg . at last , grit hi teeth and clench hi fist , he swore he would squeez porfiri like a lemon that veri day , and went up the stair to reassur pulcheria alexandrovna , who wa by now alarm at their long absenc . when raskolnikov got home , hi hair wa soak with sweat and he wa breath heavili . he went rapidli up the stair , walk into hi unlock room and at onc fasten the latch . then in senseless terror he rush to the corner , to that hole under the paper where he had put the thing ; put hi hand in , and for some minut felt care in the hole , in everi crack and fold of the paper . find noth , he got up and drew a deep breath . as he wa reach the step of bakaleyev ’ s , he suddenli fanci that someth , a chain , a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrap with the old woman ’ s handwrit on it , might somehow have slip out and been lost in some crack , and then might suddenli turn up as unexpect , conclus evid against him . he stood as though lost in thought , and a strang , humili , half senseless smile stray on hi lip . he took hi cap at last and went quietli out of the room . hi idea were all tangl . he went dreamili through the gateway . “ here he is himself , ” shout a loud voic . he rais hi head . the porter wa stand at the door of hi littl room and wa point him out to a short man who look like an artisan , wear a long coat and a waistcoat , and look at a distanc remark like a woman . he stoop , and hi head in a greasi cap hung forward . from hi wrinkl flabbi face he look over fifti ; hi littl eye were lost in fat and they look out grimli , sternli and discontentedli . “ what is it ? ” raskolnikov ask , go up to the porter . the man stole a look at him from under hi brow and he look at him attent , deliber ; then he turn slowli and went out of the gate into the street without say a word . “ what is it ? ” cri raskolnikov . “ whi , he there wa ask whether a student live here , mention your name and whom you lodg with . i saw you come and point you out and he went away . it ’ s funny. ” the porter too seem rather puzzl , but not much so , and after wonder for a moment he turn and went back to hi room . raskolnikov ran after the stranger , and at onc caught sight of him walk along the other side of the street with the same even , deliber step with hi eye fix on the ground , as though in medit . he soon overtook him , but for some time walk behind him . at last , move on to a level with him , he look at hi face . the man notic him at onc , look at him quickli , but drop hi eye again ; and so they walk for a minut side by side without utter a word . “ you were inquir for me ... of the porter ? ” raskolnikov said at last , but in a curious quiet voic . the man made no answer ; he didn ’ t even look at him . again they were both silent . “ whi do you ... come and ask for me ... and say noth .... what ’ s the mean of it ? ” raskolnikov ’ s voic broke and he seem unabl to articul the word clearli . the man rais hi eye thi time and turn a gloomi sinist look at raskolnikov . “ murder ! ” he said suddenli in a quiet but clear and distinct voic . raskolnikov went on walk besid him . hi leg felt suddenli weak , a cold shiver ran down hi spine , and hi heart seem to stand still for a moment , then suddenli began throb as though it were set free . so they walk for about a hundr pace , side by side in silenc . the man did not look at him . “ what do you mean ... what is .... who is a murder ? ” mutter raskolnikov hardli audibl . “ _you_ are a murder , ” the man answer still more articul and emphat , with a smile of triumphant hatr , and again he look straight into raskolnikov ’ s pale face and stricken eye . they had just reach the cross-road . the man turn to the left without look behind him . raskolnikov remain stand , gaze after him . he saw him turn round fifti pace away and look back at him still stand there . raskolnikov could not see clearli , but he fanci that he wa again smile the same smile of cold hatr and triumph . with slow falter step , with shake knee , raskolnikov made hi way back to hi littl garret , feel chill all over . he took off hi cap and put it on the tabl , and for ten minut he stood without move . then he sank exhaust on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretch himself on it . so he lay for half an hour . he thought of noth . some thought or fragment of thought , some imag without order or coher float befor hi mind -- face of peopl he had seen in hi childhood or met somewher onc , whom he would never have recal , the belfri of the church at v. , the billiard tabl in a restaur and some offic play billiard , the smell of cigar in some underground tobacco shop , a tavern room , a back staircas quit dark , all sloppi with dirti water and strewn with egg-shel , and the sunday bell float in from somewher .... the imag follow one anoth , whirl like a hurrican . some of them he like and tri to clutch at , but they fade and all the while there wa an oppress within him , but it wa not overwhelm , sometim it wa even pleasant .... the slight shiver still persist , but that too wa an almost pleasant sensat . he heard the hurri footstep of razumihin ; he close hi eye and pretend to be asleep . razumihin open the door and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesit , then he step softli into the room and went cautious to the sofa . raskolnikov heard nastasya ’ s whisper : “ don ’ t disturb him ! let him sleep . he can have hi dinner later. ” “ quit so , ” answer razumihin . both withdrew care and close the door . anoth half-hour pass . raskolnikov open hi eye , turn on hi back again , clasp hi hand behind hi head . “ who is he ?

” raskolnikov wonder , but he tri to overtak him . when he wa within ten pace he recognis him and wa frighten ; it wa the same man with stoop shoulder in the long coat . raskolnikov follow him at a distanc ; hi heart wa beat ; they went down a turn ; the man still did not look round . “ doe he know i am follow him ? ” thought raskolnikov . the man went into the gateway of a big hous . raskolnikov hasten to the gate and look in to see whether he would look round and sign to him . in the court-yard the man did turn round and again seem to beckon him . raskolnikov at onc follow him into the yard , but the man wa gone . he must have gone up the first staircas . raskolnikov rush after him . he heard slow measur step two flight abov . the staircas seem strang familiar . he reach the window on the first floor ; the moon shone through the pane with a melancholi and mysteri light ; then he reach the second floor . bah ! thi is the flat where the painter were at work ... but how wa it he did not recognis it at onc ? the step of the man abov had die away . “ so he must have stop or hidden somewhere. ” he reach the third storey , should he go on ? there wa a still that wa dread .... but he went on . the sound of hi own footstep scare and frighten him . how dark it wa ! the man must be hide in some corner here . ah ! the flat wa stand wide open , he hesit and went in . it wa veri dark and empti in the passag , as though everyth had been remov ; he crept on tipto into the parlour which wa flood with moonlight . everyth there wa as befor , the chair , the looking-glass , the yellow sofa and the pictur in the frame . a huge , round , copper-r moon look in at the window . “ it ’ s the moon that make it so still , weav some mysteri , ” thought raskolnikov . he stood and wait , wait a long while , and the more silent the moonlight , the more violent hi heart beat , till it wa pain . and still the same hush . suddenli he heard a momentari sharp crack like the snap of a splinter and all wa still again . a fli flew up suddenli and struck the window pane with a plaintiv buzz . at that moment he notic in the corner between the window and the littl cupboard someth like a cloak hang on the wall . “ whi is that cloak here ? ” he thought , “ it wasn ’ t there befor .... ” he went up to it quietli and felt that there wa someon hide behind it . he cautious move the cloak and saw , sit on a chair in the corner , the old woman bent doubl so that he couldn ’ t see her face ; but it wa she . he stood over her . “ she is afraid , ” he thought . he stealthili took the axe from the noos and struck her one blow , then anoth on the skull . but strang to say she did not stir , as though she were made of wood . he wa frighten , bent down nearer and tri to look at her ; but she , too , bent her head lower . he bent right down to the ground and peep up into her face from below , he peep and turn cold with horror : the old woman wa sit and laugh , shake with noiseless laughter , do her utmost that he should not hear it . suddenli he fanci that the door from the bedroom wa open a littl and that there wa laughter and whisper within . he wa overcom with frenzi and he began hit the old woman on the head with all hi forc , but at everi blow of the axe the laughter and whisper from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman wa simpli shake with mirth . he wa rush away , but the passag wa full of peopl , the door of the flat stood open and on the land , on the stair and everywher below there were peopl , row of head , all look , but huddl togeth in silenc and expect . someth grip hi heart , hi leg were root to the spot , they would not move .... he tri to scream and woke up . he drew a deep breath -- but hi dream seem strang to persist : hi door wa flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watch him intent . raskolnikov had hardli open hi eye and he instantli close them again . he lay on hi back without stir . “ is it still a dream ? ” he wonder and again rais hi eyelid hardli percept ; the stranger wa stand in the same place , still watch him . he step cautious into the room , care close the door after him , went up to the tabl , paus a moment , still keep hi eye on raskolnikov , and noiselessli seat himself on the chair by the sofa ; he put hi hat on the floor besid him and lean hi hand on hi cane and hi chin on hi hand . it wa evid that he wa prepar to wait indefinit . as far as raskolnikov could make out from hi stolen glanc , he wa a man no longer young , stout , with a full , fair , almost whitish beard . ten minut pass . it wa still light , but begin to get dusk . there wa complet still in the room . not a sound came from the stair . onli a big fli buzz and flutter against the window pane . it wa unbear at last . raskolnikov suddenli got up and sat on the sofa . “ come , tell me what you want. ” “ i knew you were not asleep , but onli pretend , ” the stranger answer oddli , laugh calmli . “ arkadi ivanovitch svidrigaïlov , allow me to introduc myself .... ” part iv chapter i “ can thi be still a dream ?

did you think so ? ” svidrigaïlov ask in astonish . “ did you realli ? didn ’ t i say that there wa someth in common between us , eh ? ” “ you never said so ! ” raskolnikov cri sharpli and with heat . “ didn ’ t i ? ” “ no ! ” “ i thought i did . when i came in and saw you lie with your eye shut , pretend , i said to myself at onc , ‘ here ’ s the man. ’ ” “ what do you mean by ‘ the man ? ’ what are you talk about ? ” cri raskolnikov . “ what do i mean ? i realli don ’ t know .... ” svidrigaïlov mutter ingenu , as though he , too , were puzzl . for a minut they were silent . they stare in each other ’ s face . “ that ’ s all nonsens ! ” raskolnikov shout with vexat . “ what doe she say when she come to you ? ” “ she ! would you believ it , she talk of the silliest trifl and -- man is a strang creatur -- it make me angri . the first time she came in ( i wa tire you know : the funer servic , the funer ceremoni , the lunch afterward . at last i wa left alon in my studi . i light a cigar and began to think ) , she came in at the door . ‘ you ’ ve been so busi to-day , arkadi ivanovitch , you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock , ’ she said . all those seven year i ’ ve wound that clock everi week , and if i forgot it she would alway remind me . the next day i set off on my way here . i got out at the station at daybreak ; i ’ d been asleep , tire out , with my eye half open , i wa drink some coffe . i look up and there wa suddenli marfa petrovna sit besid me with a pack of card in her hand . ‘ shall i tell your fortun for the journey , arkadi ivanovitch ? ’ she wa a great hand at tell fortun . i shall never forgiv myself for not ask her to . i ran away in a fright , and , besid , the bell rang . i wa sit to-day , feel veri heavi after a miser dinner from a cookshop ; i wa sit smoke , all of a sudden marfa petrovna again . she came in veri smart in a new green silk dress with a long train . ‘ good day , arkadi ivanovitch ! how do you like my dress ? aniska can ’ t make like this. ’ ( aniska wa a dressmak in the countri , one of our former serf girl who had been train in moscow , a pretti wench . ) she stood turn round befor me . i look at the dress , and then i look care , veri care , at her face . ‘ i wonder you troubl to come to me about such trifl , marfa petrovna. ’ ‘ good graciou , you won ’ t let one disturb you about anyth !

’ he came in and went to the cupboard where my pipe were . i sat still and thought ‘ he is do it out of reveng , ’ becaus we had a violent quarrel just befor hi death . ‘ how dare you come in with a hole in your elbow ? ’ i said . ‘ go away , you scamp ! ’ he turn and went out , and never came again . i didn ’ t tell marfa petrovna at the time . i want to have a servic sung for him , but i wa ashamed. ” “ you should go to a doctor. ” “ i know i am not well , without your tell me , though i don ’ t know what ’ s wrong ; i believ i am five time as strong as you are . i didn ’ t ask you whether you believ that ghost are seen , but whether you believ that they exist. ” “ no , i won ’ t believ it !

and , behold , the dream of so mani year wa all but realis ; the beauti and educ of avdotya romanovna had impress him ; her helpless posit had been a great allur ; in her he had found even more than he dream of . here wa a girl of pride , charact , virtu , of educ and breed superior to hi own ( he felt that ) , and thi creatur would be slavishli grate all her life for hi heroic condescens , and would humbl herself in the dust befor him , and he would have absolut , unbound power over her ! ... not long befor , he had , too , after long reflect and hesit , made an import chang in hi career and wa now enter on a wider circl of busi . with thi chang hi cherish dream of rise into a higher class of societi seem like to be realis .... he wa , in fact , determin to tri hi fortun in petersburg . he knew that women could do a veri great deal . the fascin of a charm , virtuou , highli educ woman might make hi way easier , might do wonder in attract peopl to him , throw an aureol round him , and now everyth wa in ruin ! thi sudden horribl ruptur affect him like a clap of thunder ; it wa like a hideou joke , an absurd . he had onli been a tini bit master , had not even time to speak out , had simpli made a joke , been carri away -- and it had end so serious . and , of cours , too , he did love dounia in hi own way ; he alreadi possess her in hi dream -- and all at onc ! no ! the next day , the veri next day , it must all be set right , smooth over , settl . abov all he must crush that conceit milksop who wa the caus of it all . with a sick feel he could not help recal razumihin too , but , he soon reassur himself on that score ; as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him ! the man he realli dread in earnest wa svidrigaïlov .... he had , in short , a great deal to attend to .... * * * * * “ no , i , i am more to blame than anyon ! ” said dounia , kiss and embrac her mother . “ i wa tempt by hi money , but on my honour , brother , i had no idea he wa such a base man . if i had seen through him befor , noth would have tempt me ! don ’ t blame me , brother ! ” “ god ha deliv us ! god ha deliv us ! ” pulcheria alexandrovna mutter , but half conscious , as though scarc abl to realis what had happen . they were all reliev , and in five minut they were laugh . onli now and then dounia turn white and frown , rememb what had pass . pulcheria alexandrovna wa surpris to find that she , too , wa glad : she had onli that morn thought ruptur with luzhin a terribl misfortun . razumihin wa delight . he did not yet dare to express hi joy fulli , but he wa in a fever of excit as though a ton-weight had fallen off hi heart . now he had the right to devot hi life to them , to serv them .... anyth might happen now ! but he felt afraid to think of further possibl and dare not let hi imagin rang . but raskolnikov sat still in the same place , almost sullen and indiffer . though he had been the most insist on get rid of luzhin , he seem now the least concern at what had happen . dounia could not help think that he wa still angri with her , and pulcheria alexandrovna watch him timidli . “ what did svidrigaïlov say to you ? ” said dounia , approach him . “ ye , ye ! ” cri pulcheria alexandrovna . raskolnikov rais hi head . “ he want to make you a present of ten thousand roubl and he desir to see you onc in my presence. ” “ see her ! on no account ! ” cri pulcheria alexandrovna . “ and how dare he offer her money ! ” then raskolnikov repeat ( rather dryli ) hi convers with svidrigaïlov , omit hi account of the ghostli visit of marfa petrovna , wish to avoid all unnecessari talk . “ what answer did you give him ? ” ask dounia . “ at first i said i would not take ani messag to you . then he said that he would do hi utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help . he assur me that hi passion for you wa a pass infatu , now he ha no feel for you . he doesn ’ t want you to marri luzhin .... hi talk wa altogeth rather muddled. ” “ how do you explain him to yourself , rodya ? how did he strike you ? ” “ i must confess i don ’ t quit understand him . he offer you ten thousand , and yet say he is not well off . he say he is go away , and in ten minut he forget he ha said it . then he say he is go to be marri and ha alreadi fix on the girl .... no doubt he ha a motiv , and probabl a bad one . but it ’ s odd that he should be so clumsi about it if he had ani design against you .... of cours , i refus thi money on your account , onc for all . altogeth , i thought him veri strang .... one might almost think he wa mad . but i may be mistaken ; that may onli be the part he assum . the death of marfa petrovna seem to have made a great impress on him. ” “ god rest her soul , ” exclaim pulcheria alexandrovna . “ i shall alway , alway pray for her ! where should we be now , dounia , without thi three thousand ! it ’ s as though it had fallen from heaven ! whi , rodya , thi morn we had onli three roubl in our pocket and dounia and i were just plan to pawn her watch , so as to avoid borrow from that man until he offer help. ” dounia seem strang impress by svidrigaïlov ’ s offer . she still stood medit . “ he ha got some terribl plan , ” she said in a half whisper to herself , almost shudder . raskolnikov notic thi disproportion terror . “ i fanci i shall have to see him more than onc again , ” he said to dounia . “ we will watch him ! i will track him out ! ” cri razumihin , vigor . “ i won ’ t lose sight of him . rodya ha given me leav . he said to me himself just now . ‘ take care of my sister. ’ will you give me leav , too , avdotya romanovna ? ” dounia smile and held out her hand , but the look of anxieti did not leav her face . pulcheria alexandrovna gaze at her timidli , but the three thousand roubl had obvious a sooth effect on her . a quarter of an hour later , they were all engag in a live convers . even raskolnikov listen attent for some time , though he did not talk . razumihin wa the speaker . “ and whi , whi should you go away ? ” he flow on ecstat . “ and what are you to do in a littl town ? the great thing is , you are all here togeth and you need one anoth -- you do need one anoth , believ me . for a time , anyway .... take me into partnership , and i assur you we ’ ll plan a capit enterpris . listen !

good heaven ! ” cri sonia weakli , and she stood root to the spot . “ which is your room ? thi way ? ” and raskolnikov , tri not to look at her , hasten in . a minut later sonia , too , came in with the candl , set down the candlestick and , complet disconcert , stood befor him inexpress agit and appar frighten by hi unexpect visit . the colour rush suddenli to her pale face and tear came into her eye ... she felt sick and asham and happi , too .... raskolnikov turn away quickli and sat on a chair by the tabl . he scan the room in a rapid glanc . it wa a larg but exceedingli low-pitch room , the onli one let by the kapernaumov , to whose room a close door led in the wall on the left . in the opposit side on the right hand wall wa anoth door , alway kept lock . that led to the next flat , which form a separ lodg . sonia ’ s room look like a barn ; it wa a veri irregular quadrangl and thi gave it a grotesqu appear . a wall with three window look out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner form a veri acut angl , and it wa difficult to see in it without veri strong light . the other corner wa disproportion obtus . there wa scarc ani furnitur in the big room : in the corner on the right wa a bedstead , besid it , nearest the door , a chair . a plain , deal tabl cover by a blue cloth stood against the same wall , close to the door into the other flat . two rush-bottom chair stood by the tabl . on the opposit wall near the acut angl stood a small plain wooden chest of drawer look , as it were , lost in a desert . that wa all there wa in the room . the yellow , scratch and shabbi wall-pap wa black in the corner . it must have been damp and full of fume in the winter . there wa everi sign of poverti ; even the bedstead had no curtain . sonia look in silenc at her visitor , who wa so attent and unceremoni scrutinis her room , and even began at last to trembl with terror , as though she wa stand befor her judg and the arbit of her destini . “ i am late .... it ’ s eleven , isn ’ t it ? ” he ask , still not lift hi eye . “ ye , ” mutter sonia , “ oh ye , it is , ” she ad , hastili , as though in that lay her mean of escap . “ my landladi ’ s clock ha just struck ... i heard it myself .... ” “ i ’ ve come to you for the last time , ” raskolnikov went on gloomili , although thi wa the first time . “ i may perhap not see you again ... ” “ are you ... go away ? ” “ i don ’ t know ... to-morrow .... ” “ then you are not come to katerina ivanovna to-morrow ? ” sonia ’ s voic shook . “ i don ’ t know . i shall know to-morrow morn .... never mind that : i ’ ve come to say one word .... ” he rais hi brood eye to her and suddenli notic that he wa sit down while she wa all the while stand befor him . “ whi are you stand ? sit down , ” he said in a chang voic , gentl and friendli . she sat down . he look kindli and almost compassion at her . “ how thin you are !

you see , she is quit like a child .... her mind is quit unhing , you see ... from sorrow . and how clever she use to be ... how gener ... how kind ! ah , you don ’ t understand , you don ’ t understand ! ” sonia said thi as though in despair , wring her hand in excit and distress . her pale cheek flush , there wa a look of anguish in her eye . it wa clear that she wa stir to the veri depth , that she wa long to speak , to champion , to express someth . a sort of _insatiable_ compass , if one may so express it , wa reflect in everi featur of her face . “ beat me ! how can you ? good heaven , beat me ! and if she did beat me , what then ? what of it ? you know noth , noth about it .... she is so unhappi ... ah , how unhappi ! and ill .... she is seek righteous , she is pure . she ha such faith that there must be righteous everywher and she expect it .... and if you were to tortur her , she wouldn ’ t do wrong . she doesn ’ t see that it ’ s imposs for peopl to be righteou and she is angri at it . like a child , like a child . she is good ! ” “ and what will happen to you ? ” sonia look at him inquiringli . “ they are left on your hand , you see . they were all on your hand befor , though .... and your father came to you to beg for drink . well , how will it be now ? ” “ i don ’ t know , ” sonia articul mourn . “ will they stay there ? ” “ i don ’ t know .... they are in debt for the lodg , but the landladi , i hear , said to-day that she want to get rid of them , and katerina ivanovna say that she won ’ t stay anoth minute. ” “ how is it she is so bold ? she reli upon you ? ” “ oh , no , don ’ t talk like that .... we are one , we live like one. ” sonia wa agit again and even angri , as though a canari or some other littl bird were to be angri . “ and what could she do ? what , what could she do ? ” she persist , get hot and excit . “ and how she cri to-day ! her mind is unhing , haven ’ t you notic it ? at one minut she is worri like a child that everyth should be right to-morrow , the lunch and all that .... then she is wring her hand , spit blood , weep , and all at onc she will begin knock her head against the wall , in despair . then she will be comfort again . she build all her hope on you ; she say that you will help her now and that she will borrow a littl money somewher and go to her nativ town with me and set up a board school for the daughter of gentlemen and take me to superintend it , and we will begin a new splendid life . and she kiss and hug me , comfort me , and you know she ha such faith , such faith in her fanci ! one can ’ t contradict her . and all the day long she ha been wash , clean , mend . she drag the wash tub into the room with her feebl hand and sank on the bed , gasp for breath . we went thi morn to the shop to buy shoe for polenka and lida for their are quit worn out . onli the money we ’ d reckon wasn ’ t enough , not nearli enough . and she pick out such dear littl boot , for she ha tast , you don ’ t know . and there in the shop she burst out cri befor the shopmen becaus she hadn ’ t enough .... ah , it wa sad to see her .... ” “ well , after that i can understand your live like thi , ” raskolnikov said with a bitter smile . “ and aren ’ t you sorri for them ? aren ’ t you sorri ? ” sonia flew at him again . “ whi , i know , you gave your last penni yourself , though you ’ d seen noth of it , and if you ’ d seen everyth , oh dear ! and how often , how often i ’ ve brought her to tear ! onli last week ! ye , i ! onli a week befor hi death . i wa cruel ! and how often i ’ ve done it ! ah , i ’ ve been wretch at the thought of it all day ! ” sonia wrung her hand as she spoke at the pain of rememb it . “ you were cruel ? ” “ ye , i -- i. i went to see them , ” she went on , weep , “ and father said , ‘ read me someth , sonia , my head ach , read to me , here ’ s a book. ’ he had a book he had got from andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov , he live there , he alway use to get hold of such funni book . and i said , ‘ i can ’ t stay , ’ as i didn ’ t want to read , and i ’ d gone in chiefli to show katerina ivanovna some collar . lizaveta , the pedlar , sold me some collar and cuff cheap , pretti , new , embroid one . katerina ivanovna like them veri much ; she put them on and look at herself in the glass and wa delight with them . ‘ make me a present of them , sonia , ’ she said , ‘ pleas do. ’ ‘ _pleas do_ , ’ she said , she want them so much . and when could she wear them ? they just remind her of her old happi day . she look at herself in the glass , admir herself , and she ha no cloth at all , no thing of her own , hasn ’ t had all these year ! and she never ask anyon for anyth ; she is proud , she ’ d sooner give away everyth . and these she ask for , she like them so much . and i wa sorri to give them . ‘ what use are they to you , katerina ivanovna ? ’ i said . i spoke like that to her , i ought not to have said that ! she gave me such a look . and she wa so griev , so griev at my refus her . and it wa so sad to see .... and she wa not griev for the collar , but for my refus , i saw that . ah , if onli i could bring it all back , chang it , take back those word ! ah , if i ... but it ’ s noth to you ! ” “ did you know lizaveta , the pedlar ? ” “ ye .... did you know her ? ” sonia ask with some surpris . “ katerina ivanovna is in consumpt , rapid consumpt ; she will soon die , ” said raskolnikov after a paus , without answer her question . “ oh , no , no , no ! ” and sonia unconsci clutch both hi hand , as though implor that she should not . “ but it will be better if she doe die. ” “ no , not better , not at all better ! ” sonia unconsci repeat in dismay . “ and the children ? what can you do except take them to live with you ? ” “ oh , i don ’ t know , ” cri sonia , almost in despair , and she put her hand to her head . it wa evid that that idea had veri often occur to her befor and he had onli rous it again . “ and , what , if even now , while katerina ivanovna is aliv , you get ill and are taken to the hospit , what will happen then ? ” he persist pitilessli . “ how can you ? that can not be ! ” and sonia ’ s face work with aw terror . “ can not be ? ” raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile . “ you are not insur against it , are you ? what will happen to them then ? they will be in the street , all of them , she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall , as she did to-day , and the children will cri .... then she will fall down , be taken to the polic station and to the hospit , she will die , and the children ... ” “ oh , no .... god will not let it be ! ” broke at last from sonia ’ s overburden bosom . she listen , look imploringli at him , clasp her hand in dumb entreati , as though it all depend upon him . raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room . a minut pass . sonia wa stand with her hand and her head hang in terribl deject . “ and can ’ t you save ? put by for a raini day ? ” he ask , stop suddenli befor her . “ no , ” whisper sonia . “ of cours not . have you tri ? ” he ad almost iron . “ yes. ” “ and it didn ’ t come off ! of cours not ! no need to ask. ” and again he pace the room . anoth minut pass . “ you don ’ t get money everi day ? ” sonia wa more confus than ever and colour rush into her face again . “ no , ” she whisper with a pain effort . “ it will be the same with polenka , no doubt , ” he said suddenli . “ no , no ! it can ’ t be , no ! ” sonia cri aloud in desper , as though she had been stab . “ god would not allow anyth so aw ! ” “ he let other come to it. ” “ no , no ! god will protect her , god ! ” she repeat besid herself . “ but , perhap , there is no god at all , ” raskolnikov answer with a sort of malign , laugh and look at her . sonia ’ s face suddenli chang ; a tremor pass over it . she look at him with unutter reproach , tri to say someth , but could not speak and broke into bitter , bitter sob , hide her face in her hand . “ you say katerina ivanovna ’ s mind is unhing ; your own mind is unhing , ” he said after a brief silenc . five minut pass . he still pace up and down the room in silenc , not look at her . at last he went up to her ; hi eye glitter . he put hi two hand on her shoulder and look straight into her tear face . hi eye were hard , feverish and pierc , hi lip were twitch . all at onc he bent down quickli and drop to the ground , kiss her foot . sonia drew back from him as from a madman . and certainli he look like a madman . “ what are you do to me ? ” she mutter , turn pale , and a sudden anguish clutch at her heart . he stood up at onc . “ i did not bow down to you , i bow down to all the suffer of human , ” he said wildli and walk away to the window . “ listen , ” he ad , turn to her a minut later . “ i said just now to an insol man that he wa not worth your littl finger ... and that i did my sister honour make her sit besid you. ” “ ach , you said that to them ! and in her presenc ? ” cri sonia , frighten . “ sit down with me ! an honour ! whi , i ’ m ... dishonour .... ah , whi did you say that ? ” “ it wa not becaus of your dishonour and your sin i said that of you , but becaus of your great suffer . but you are a great sinner , that ’ s true , ” he ad almost solemnli , “ and your worst sin is that you have destroy and betray yourself _for nothing_ . isn ’ t that fear ? isn ’ t it fear that you are live in thi filth which you loath so , and at the same time you know yourself ( you ’ ve onli to open your eye ) that you are not help anyon by it , not save anyon from anyth ? tell me , ” he went on almost in a frenzi , “ how thi shame and degrad can exist in you side by side with other , opposit , holi feel ? it would be better , a thousand time better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all ! ” “ but what would becom of them ? ” sonia ask faintli , gaze at him with eye of anguish , but not seem surpris at hi suggest . raskolnikov look strang at her . he read it all in her face ; so she must have had that thought alreadi , perhap mani time , and earnestli she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestli , that now she scarc wonder at hi suggest . she had not even notic the cruelti of hi word . ( the signific of hi reproach and hi peculiar attitud to her shame she had , of cours , not notic either , and that , too , wa clear to him . ) but he saw how monstrous the thought of her disgrac , shame posit wa tortur her and had long tortur her . “ what , what , ” he thought , “ could hitherto have hinder her from put an end to it ? ” onli then he realis what those poor littl orphan children and that piti half-crazi katerina ivanovna , knock her head against the wall in her consumpt , meant for sonia . but , nevertheless , it wa clear to him again that with her charact and the amount of educ she had after all receiv , she could not in ani case remain so . he wa still confront by the question , how could she have remain so long in that posit without go out of her mind , sinc she could not bring herself to jump into the water ? of cours he knew that sonia ’ s posit wa an except case , though unhappili not uniqu and not infrequ , inde ; but that veri exception , her ting of educ , her previou life might , one would have thought , have kill her at the first step on that revolt path . what held her up -- sure not deprav ? all that infami had obvious onli touch her mechan , not one drop of real deprav had penetr to her heart ; he saw that . he saw through her as she stood befor him .... “ there are three way befor her , ” he thought , “ the canal , the madhous , or ... at last to sink into deprav which obscur the mind and turn the heart to stone. ” the last idea wa the most revolt , but he wa a sceptic , he wa young , abstract , and therefor cruel , and so he could not help believ that the last end wa the most like . “ but can that be true ? ” he cri to himself . “ can that creatur who ha still preserv the puriti of her spirit be conscious drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniqu ? can the process alreadi have begun ? can it be that she ha onli been abl to bear it till now , becaus vice ha begun to be less loathsom to her ? no , no , that can not be ! ” he cri , as sonia had just befor . “ no , what ha kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they , the children .... and if she ha not gone out of her mind ... but who say she ha not gone out of her mind ? is she in her sens ? can one talk , can one reason as she doe ? how can she sit on the edg of the abyss of loathsom into which she is slip and refus to listen when she is told of danger ? doe she expect a miracl ? no doubt she doe . doesn ’ t that all mean mad ? ” he stay obstin at that thought . he like that explan inde better than ani other . he began look more intent at her . “ so you pray to god a great deal , sonia ? ” he ask her . sonia did not speak ; he stood besid her wait for an answer . “ what should i be without god ? ” she whisper rapidli , forcibl , glanc at him with suddenli flash eye , and squeez hi hand . “ ah , so that is it ! ” he thought . “ and what doe god do for you ? ” he ask , probe her further . sonia wa silent a long while , as though she could not answer . her weak chest kept heav with emot . “ be silent ! don ’ t ask ! you don ’ t deserv ! ” she cri suddenli , look sternli and wrath at him . “ that ’ s it , that ’ s it , ” he repeat to himself . “ he doe everyth , ” she whisper quickli , look down again . “ that ’ s the way out ! that ’ s the explan , ” he decid , scrutinis her with eager curios , with a new , strang , almost morbid feel . he gaze at that pale , thin , irregular , angular littl face , those soft blue eye , which could flash with such fire , such stern energi , that littl bodi still shake with indign and anger -- and it all seem to him more and more strang , almost imposs . “ she is a religi maniac ! ” he repeat to himself . there wa a book lie on the chest of drawer . he had notic it everi time he pace up and down the room . now he took it up and look at it . it wa the new testament in the russian translat . it wa bound in leather , old and worn . “ where did you get that ? ” he call to her across the room . she wa still stand in the same place , three step from the tabl . “ it wa brought me , ” she answer , as it were unwillingli , not look at him . “ who brought it ? ” “ lizaveta , i ask her for it. ” “ lizaveta ! strang ! ” he thought . everyth about sonia seem to him stranger and more wonder everi moment . he carri the book to the candl and began to turn over the page . “ where is the stori of lazaru ? ” he ask suddenli . sonia look obstin at the ground and would not answer . she wa stand sideway to the tabl . “ where is the rais of lazaru ? find it for me , sonia. ” she stole a glanc at him . “ you are not look in the right place .... it ’ s in the fourth gospel , ” she whisper sternli , without look at him . “ find it and read it to me , ” he said . he sat down with hi elbow on the tabl , lean hi head on hi hand and look away sullenli , prepar to listen . “ in three week ’ time they ’ ll welcom me in the madhous ! i shall be there if i am not in a wors place , ” he mutter to himself . sonia heard raskolnikov ’ s request distrust and move hesitatingli to the tabl . she took the book howev . “ haven ’ t you read it ? ” she ask , look up at him across the tabl . her voic becam sterner and sterner . “ long ago .... when i wa at school . read ! ” “ and haven ’ t you heard it in church ? ” “ i ... haven ’ t been . do you often go ? ” “ n-no , ” whisper sonia . raskolnikov smile . “ i understand .... and you won ’ t go to your father ’ s funer to-morrow ? ” “ ye , i shall . i wa at church last week , too ... i had a requiem service. ” “ for whom ? ” “ for lizaveta . she wa kill with an axe. ” hi nerv were more and more strain . hi head began to go round . “ were you friend with lizaveta ? ” “ ye .... she wa good ... she use to come ... not often ... she couldn ’ t .... we use to read togeth and ... talk . she will see god. ” the last phrase sound strang in hi ear . and here wa someth new again : the mysteri meet with lizaveta and both of them -- religi maniac . “ i shall be a religi maniac myself soon ! it ’ s infecti ! ” “ read ! ” he cri irrit and insist . sonia still hesit . her heart wa throb . she hardli dare to read to him . he look almost with exasper at the “ unhappi lunatic. ” “ what for ? you don ’ t believ ? ... ” she whisper softli and as it were breathlessli . “ read ! i want you to , ” he persist . “ you use to read to lizaveta. ” sonia open the book and found the place . her hand were shake , her voic fail her . twice she tri to begin and could not bring out the first syllabl . “ now a certain man wa sick name lazaru of bethani ... ” she forc herself at last to read , but at the third word her voic broke like an overstrain string . there wa a catch in her breath . raskolnikov saw in part whi sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw thi , the more roughli and irrit he insist on her do so . he understood onli too well how pain it wa for her to betray and unveil all that wa her _own_ . he understood that these feel realli were her _secret treasure_ , which she had kept perhap for year , perhap from childhood , while she live with an unhappi father and a distract stepmoth craze by grief , in the midst of starv children and unseemli abus and reproach . but at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that , although it fill her with dread and suffer , yet she had a torment desir to read and to read to _him_ that he might hear it , and to read _now_ whatev might come of it ! ... he read thi in her eye , he could see it in her intens emot . she master herself , control the spasm in her throat and went on read the eleventh chapter of st. john . she went on to the nineteenth vers : “ and mani of the jew came to martha and mari to comfort them concern their brother . “ then martha as soon as she heard that jesu wa come went and met him : but mari sat still in the hous . “ then said martha unto jesu , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not die . “ but i know that even now whatsoev thou wilt ask of god , god will give it thee .... ” then she stop again with a shamefac feel that her voic would quiver and break again . “ jesu said unto her , thi brother shall rise again . “ martha saith unto him , i know that he shall rise again in the resurrect , at the last day . “ jesu said unto her , i am the resurrect and the life : he that believeth in me though he were dead , yet shall he live . “ and whosoev liveth and believeth in me shall never die . believest thou thi ? “ she saith unto him , ” ( and draw a pain breath , sonia read distinctli and forcibl as though she were make a public confess of faith . ) “ yea , lord : i believ that thou art the christ , the son of god which should come into the world. ” she stop and look up quickli at him , but control herself went on read . raskolnikov sat without move , hi elbow on the tabl and hi eye turn away . she read to the thirty-second vers . “ then when mari wa come where jesu wa and saw him , she fell down at hi feet , say unto him , lord if thou hadst been here , my brother had not die . “ when jesu therefor saw her weep , and the jew also weep which came with her , he groan in the spirit and wa troubl , “ and said , where have ye laid him ? they said unto him , lord , come and see . “ jesu wept . “ then said the jew , behold how he love him ! “ and some of them said , could not thi man which open the eye of the blind , have caus that even thi man should not have die ? ” raskolnikov turn and look at her with emot . ye , he had known it ! she wa trembl in a real physic fever . he had expect it . she wa get near the stori of the greatest miracl and a feel of immens triumph came over her . her voic rang out like a bell ; triumph and joy gave it power . the line danc befor her eye , but she knew what she wa read by heart . at the last vers “ could not thi man which open the eye of the blind ... ” drop her voic she passion reproduc the doubt , the reproach and censur of the blind disbeliev jew , who in anoth moment would fall at hi feet as though struck by thunder , sob and believ .... “ and _he , he_ -- too , is blind and unbeliev , he , too , will hear , he , too , will believ , ye , ye ! at onc , now , ” wa what she wa dream , and she wa quiver with happi anticip . “ jesu therefor again groan in himself cometh to the grave . it wa a cave , and a stone lay upon it . “ jesu said , take ye away the stone . martha , the sister of him that wa dead , saith unto him , lord by thi time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days. ” she laid emphasi on the word _four_ . “ jesu saith unto her , said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believ , thou shouldest see the glori of god ? “ then they took away the stone from the place where the dead wa laid . and jesu lift up hi eye and said , father , i thank thee that thou hast heard me . “ and i knew that thou hearest me alway ; but becaus of the peopl which stand by i said it , that they may believ that thou hast sent me . “ and when he thu had spoken , he cri with a loud voic , lazaru , come forth . “ and he that wa dead came forth. ” ( she read loudli , cold and trembl with ecstasi , as though she were see it befor her eye . ) “ bound hand and foot with gravecloth ; and hi face wa bound about with a napkin . jesu saith unto them , loos him and let him go . “ then mani of the jew which came to mari and had seen the thing which jesu did believ on him. ” she could read no more , close the book and got up from her chair quickli . “ that is all about the rais of lazaru , ” she whisper sever and abruptli , and turn away she stood motionless , not dare to rais her eye to him . she still trembl feverishli . the candle-end wa flicker out in the batter candlestick , dimli light up in the poverty-stricken room the murder and the harlot who had so strang been read togeth the etern book . five minut or more pass . “ i came to speak of someth , ” raskolnikov said aloud , frown . he got up and went to sonia . she lift her eye to him in silenc . hi face wa particularli stern and there wa a sort of savag determin in it . “ i have abandon my famili to-day , ” he said , “ my mother and sister . i am not go to see them . i ’ ve broken with them completely. ” “ what for ? ” ask sonia amaz . her recent meet with hi mother and sister had left a great impress which she could not analys . she heard hi news almost with horror . “ i have onli you now , ” he ad . “ let us go togeth .... i ’ ve come to you , we are both accurs , let us go our way togeth ! ” hi eye glitter “ as though he were mad , ” sonia thought , in her turn . “ go where ? ” she ask in alarm and she involuntarili step back . “ how do i know ? i onli know it ’ s the same road , i know that and noth more . it ’ s the same goal ! ” she look at him and understood noth . she knew onli that he wa terribl , infinit unhappi . “ no one of them will understand , if you tell them , but i have understood . i need you , that is whi i have come to you. ” “ i don ’ t understand , ” whisper sonia . “ you ’ ll understand later . haven ’ t you done the same ? you , too , have transgress ... have had the strength to transgress . you have laid hand on yourself , you have destroy a life ... _your own_ ( it ’ s all the same ! ) . you might have live in spirit and understand , but you ’ ll end in the hay market .... but you won ’ t be abl to stand it , and if you remain alon you ’ ll go out of your mind like me . you are like a mad creatur alreadi . so we must go togeth on the same road ! let us go ! ” “ what for ? what ’ s all thi for ? ” said sonia , strang and violent agit by hi word . “ what for ? becaus you can ’ t remain like thi , that ’ s whi ! you must look thing straight in the face at last , and not weep like a child and cri that god won ’ t allow it . what will happen , if you should realli be taken to the hospit to-morrow ? she is mad and in consumpt , she ’ ll soon die and the children ? do you mean to tell me polenka won ’ t come to grief ? haven ’ t you seen children here at the street corner sent out by their mother to beg ? i ’ ve found out where those mother live and in what surround . children can ’ t remain children there ! at seven the child is viciou and a thief . yet children , you know , are the imag of christ : ‘ their is the kingdom of heaven. ’ he bade us honour and love them , they are the human of the futur .... ” “ what ’ s to be done , what ’ s to be done ? ” repeat sonia , weep hyster and wring her hand . “ what ’ s to be done ? break what must be broken , onc for all , that ’ s all , and take the suffer on oneself . what , you don ’ t understand ? you ’ ll understand later .... freedom and power , and abov all , power ! over all trembl creation and all the ant-heap ! ... that ’ s the goal , rememb that ! that ’ s my farewel messag . perhap it ’ s the last time i shall speak to you . if i don ’ t come to-morrow , you ’ ll hear of it all , and then rememb these word . and some day later on , in year to come , you ’ ll understand perhap what they meant . if i come to-morrow , i ’ ll tell you who kill lizaveta .... good-bye. ” sonia start with terror . “ whi , do you know who kill her ? ” she ask , chill with horror , look wildli at him . “ i know and will tell ... you , onli you . i have chosen you out . i ’ m not come to you to ask forgiv , but simpli to tell you . i chose you out long ago to hear thi , when your father talk of you and when lizaveta wa aliv , i thought of it . good-by , don ’ t shake hand . to-morrow ! ” he went out . sonia gaze at him as at a madman . but she herself wa like one insan and felt it . her head wa go round . “ good heaven , how doe he know who kill lizaveta ? what did those word mean ? it ’ s aw ! ” but at the same time _the idea_ did not enter her head , not for a moment ! “ oh , he must be terribl unhappi ! ... he ha abandon hi mother and sister .... what for ? what ha happen ? and what had he in hi mind ? what did he say to her ? he had kiss her foot and said ... said ( ye , he had said it clearli ) that he could not live without her .... oh , merci heaven ! ” sonia spent the whole night feverish and deliri . she jump up from time to time , wept and wrung her hand , then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of polenka , katerina ivanovna and lizaveta , of read the gospel and him ... him with pale face , with burn eye ... kiss her feet , weep . on the other side of the door on the right , which divid sonia ’ s room from madam resslich ’ s flat , wa a room which had long stood empti . a card wa fix on the gate and a notic stuck in the window over the canal advertis it to let . sonia had long been accustom to the room ’ s be uninhabit . but all that time mr. svidrigaïlov had been stand , listen at the door of the empti room . when raskolnikov went out he stood still , thought a moment , went on tipto to hi own room which adjoin the empti one , brought a chair and noiselessli carri it to the door that led to sonia ’ s room . the convers had struck him as interest and remark , and he had greatli enjoy it -- so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the futur , to-morrow , for instanc , have to endur the inconveni of stand a whole hour , but might listen in comfort . chapter v when next morn at eleven o ’ clock punctual raskolnikov went into the depart of the investig of crimin caus and sent hi name in to porfiri petrovitch , he wa surpris at be kept wait so long : it wa at least ten minut befor he wa summon . he had expect that they would pounc upon him . but he stood in the waiting-room , and peopl , who appar had noth to do with him , were continu pass to and fro befor him . in the next room which look like an offic , sever clerk were sit write and obvious they had no notion who or what raskolnikov might be . he look uneasili and suspici about him to see whether there wa not some guard , some mysteri watch be kept on him to prevent hi escap . but there wa noth of the sort : he saw onli the face of clerk absorb in petti detail , then other peopl , no one seem to have ani concern with him . he might go where he like for them . the convict grew stronger in him that if that enigmat man of yesterday , that phantom sprung out of the earth , had seen everyth , they would not have let him stand and wait like that . and would they have wait till he elect to appear at eleven ? either the man had not yet given inform , or ... or simpli he knew noth , had seen noth ( and how could he have seen anyth ? ) and so all that had happen to him the day befor wa again a phantom exagger by hi sick and overstrain imagin . thi conjectur had begun to grow strong the day befor , in the midst of all hi alarm and despair . think it all over now and prepar for a fresh conflict , he wa suddenli awar that he wa trembl -- and he felt a rush of indign at the thought that he wa trembl with fear at face that hate porfiri petrovitch . what he dread abov all wa meet that man again ; he hate him with an intens , unmitig hatr and wa afraid hi hatr might betray him . hi indign wa such that he ceas trembl at onc ; he made readi to go in with a cold and arrog bear and vow to himself to keep as silent as possibl , to watch and listen and for onc at least to control hi overstrain nerv . at that moment he wa summon to porfiri petrovitch . he found porfiri petrovitch alon in hi studi . hi studi wa a room neither larg nor small , furnish with a larg writing-t , that stood befor a sofa , upholst in check materi , a bureau , a bookcas in the corner and sever chair -- all govern furnitur , of polish yellow wood . in the further wall there wa a close door , beyond it there were no doubt other room . on raskolnikov ’ s entranc porfiri petrovitch had at onc close the door by which he had come in and they remain alon . he met hi visitor with an appar genial and good-temp air , and it wa onli after a few minut that raskolnikov saw sign of a certain awkward in him , as though he had been thrown out of hi reckon or caught in someth veri secret . “ ah , my dear fellow ! here you are ... in our domain ” ... began porfiri , hold out both hand to him . “ come , sit down , old man ... or perhap you don ’ t like to be call ‘ my dear fellow ’ and ‘ old man ! ’ -- _tout court_ ? pleas don ’ t think it too familiar .... here , on the sofa. ” raskolnikov sat down , keep hi eye fix on him . “ in our domain , ” the apolog for familiar , the french phrase _tout court_ , were all characterist sign . “ he held out both hand to me , but he did not give me one -- he drew it back in time , ” struck him suspici . both were watch each other , but when their eye met , quick as lightn they look away . “ i brought you thi paper ... about the watch . here it is . is it all right or shall i copi it again ? ” “ what ? a paper ? ye , ye , don ’ t be uneasi , it ’ s all right , ” porfiri petrovitch said as though in hast , and after he had said it he took the paper and look at it . “ ye , it ’ s all right . noth more is need , ” he declar with the same rapid and he laid the paper on the tabl . a minut later when he wa talk of someth els he took it from the tabl and put it on hi bureau . “ i believ you said yesterday you would like to question me ... formal ... about my acquaint with the murder woman ? ” raskolnikov wa begin again . “ whi did i put in ‘ i believ ’ ” pass through hi mind in a flash . “ whi am i so uneasi at have put in that ‘ _i believe_ ’ ? ” came in a second flash . and he suddenli felt that hi uneasi at the mere contact with porfiri , at the first word , at the first look , had grown in an instant to monstrou proport , and that thi wa fear danger . hi nerv were quiver , hi emot wa increas . “ it ’ s bad , it ’ s bad ! i shall say too much again. ” “ ye , ye , ye ! there ’ s no hurri , there ’ s no hurri , ” mutter porfiri petrovitch , move to and fro about the tabl without ani appar aim , as it were make dash toward the window , the bureau and the tabl , at one moment avoid raskolnikov ’ s suspici glanc , then again stand still and look him straight in the face . hi fat round littl figur look veri strang , like a ball roll from one side to the other and rebound back . “ we ’ ve plenti of time . do you smoke ? have you your own ? here , a cigarett ! ” he went on , offer hi visitor a cigarett . “ you know i am receiv you here , but my own quarter are through there , you know , my govern quarter . but i am live outsid for the time , i had to have some repair done here . it ’ s almost finish now .... govern quarter , you know , are a capit thing . eh , what do you think ? ” “ ye , a capit thing , ” answer raskolnikov , look at him almost iron . “ a capit thing , a capit thing , ” repeat porfiri petrovitch , as though he had just thought of someth quit differ . “ ye , a capit thing , ” he almost shout at last , suddenli stare at raskolnikov and stop short two step from him . thi stupid repetit wa too incongru in it ineptitud with the seriou , brood and enigmat glanc he turn upon hi visitor . but thi stir raskolnikov ’ s spleen more than ever and he could not resist an iron and rather incauti challeng . “ tell me , pleas , ” he ask suddenli , look almost insol at him and take a kind of pleasur in hi own insol . “ i believ it ’ s a sort of legal rule , a sort of legal tradit -- for all investig lawyer -- to begin their attack from afar , with a trivial , or at least an irrelev subject , so as to encourag , or rather , to divert the man they are cross-examin , to disarm hi caution and then all at onc to give him an unexpect knock-down blow with some fatal question . isn ’ t that so ? it ’ s a sacr tradit , mention , i fanci , in all the manual of the art ? ” “ ye , ye .... whi , do you imagin that wa whi i spoke about govern quarter ... eh ? ” and as he said thi porfiri petrovitch screw up hi eye and wink ; a good-humour , crafti look pass over hi face . the wrinkl on hi forehead were smooth out , hi eye contract , hi featur broaden and he suddenli went off into a nervou prolong laugh , shake all over and look raskolnikov straight in the face . the latter forc himself to laugh , too , but when porfiri , see that he wa laugh , broke into such a guffaw that he turn almost crimson , raskolnikov ’ s repuls overcam all precaut ; he left off laugh , scowl and stare with hatr at porfiri , keep hi eye fix on him while hi intent prolong laughter last . there wa lack of precaut on both side , howev , for porfiri petrovitch seem to be laugh in hi visitor ’ s face and to be veri littl disturb at the annoy with which the visitor receiv it . the latter fact wa veri signific in raskolnikov ’ s eye : he saw that porfiri petrovitch had not been embarrass just befor either , but that he , raskolnikov , had perhap fallen into a trap ; that there must be someth , some motiv here unknown to him ; that , perhap , everyth wa in readi and in anoth moment would break upon him ... he went straight to the point at onc , rose from hi seat and took hi cap . “ porfiri petrovitch , ” he began resolut , though with consider irrit , “ yesterday you express a desir that i should come to you for some inquiri ” ( he laid special stress on the word “ inquiri ” ) . “ i have come and if you have anyth to ask me , ask it , and if not , allow me to withdraw . i have no time to spare .... i have to be at the funer of that man who wa run over , of whom you ... know also , ” he ad , feel angri at onc at have made thi addit and more irrit at hi anger . “ i am sick of it all , do you hear ? and have long been . it ’ s partli what made me ill . in short , ” he shout , feel that the phrase about hi ill wa still more out of place , “ in short , kindli examin me or let me go , at onc . and if you must examin me , do so in the proper form ! i will not allow you to do so otherwis , and so meanwhil , good-by , as we have evid noth to keep us now. ” “ good heaven ! what do you mean ? what shall i question you about ? ” cackl porfiri petrovitch with a chang of tone , instantli leav off laugh . “ pleas don ’ t disturb yourself , ” he began fidget from place to place and fussili make raskolnikov sit down . “ there ’ s no hurri , there ’ s no hurri , it ’ s all nonsens . oh , no , i ’ m veri glad you ’ ve come to see me at last ... i look upon you simpli as a visitor . and as for my confound laughter , pleas excus it , rodion romanovitch . rodion romanovitch ? that is your name ? ... it ’ s my nerv , you tickl me so with your witti observ ; i assur you , sometim i shake with laughter like an india-rubb ball for half an hour at a time .... i ’ m often afraid of an attack of paralysi . do sit down . pleas do , or i shall think you are angri ... ” raskolnikov did not speak ; he listen , watch him , still frown angrili . he did sit down , but still held hi cap . “ i must tell you one thing about myself , my dear rodion romanovitch , ” porfiri petrovitch continu , move about the room and again avoid hi visitor ’ s eye . “ you see , i ’ m a bachelor , a man of no consequ and not use to societi ; besid , i have noth befor me , i ’ m set , i ’ m run to seed and ... and have you notic , rodion romanovitch , that in our petersburg circl , if two clever men meet who are not intim , but respect each other , like you and me , it take them half an hour befor they can find a subject for convers -- they are dumb , they sit opposit each other and feel awkward . everyon ha subject of convers , ladi for instanc ... peopl in high societi alway have their subject of convers , _c ’ est de rigueur_ , but peopl of the middl sort like us , think peopl that is , are alway tongue-ti and awkward . what is the reason of it ? whether it is the lack of public interest , or whether it is we are so honest we don ’ t want to deceiv one anoth , i don ’ t know . what do you think ? do put down your cap , it look as if you were just go , it make me uncomfort ... i am so delight ... ” raskolnikov put down hi cap and continu listen in silenc with a seriou frown face to the vagu and empti chatter of porfiri petrovitch . “ doe he realli want to distract my attent with hi silli babbl ? ” “ i can ’ t offer you coffe here ; but whi not spend five minut with a friend ? ” porfiri patter on , “ and you know all these offici duti ... pleas don ’ t mind my run up and down , excus it , my dear fellow , i am veri much afraid of offend you , but exercis is absolut indispens for me . i ’ m alway sit and so glad to be move about for five minut ... i suffer from my sedentari life ... i alway intend to join a gymnasium ; they say that offici of all rank , even privi councillor , may be seen skip gaili there ; there you have it , modern scienc ... ye , ye .... but as for my duti here , inquiri and all such formal ... you mention inquiri yourself just now ... i assur you these interrog are sometim more embarrass for the interrog than for the interrog .... you made the observ yourself just now veri aptli and wittily. ” ( raskolnikov had made no observ of the kind . ) “ one get into a muddl ! a regular muddl ! one keep harp on the same note , like a drum ! there is to be a reform and we shall be call by a differ name , at least , he-he-h ! and as for our legal tradit , as you so wittili call it , i thoroughli agre with you . everi prison on trial , even the rudest peasant , know that they begin by disarm him with irrelev question ( as you so happili put it ) and then deal him a knock-down blow , he-he-h ! -- your felicit comparison , he-h ! so you realli imagin that i meant by ‘ govern quarter ’ ... he-h ! you are an iron person . come . i won ’ t go on ! ah , by the way , ye ! one word lead to anoth . you spoke of formal just now , apropo of the inquiri , you know . but what ’ s the use of formal ? in mani case it ’ s nonsens . sometim one ha a friendli chat and get a good deal more out of it . one can alway fall back on formal , allow me to assur you . and after all , what doe it amount to ? an examin lawyer can not be bound by formal at everi step . the work of investig is , so to speak , a free art in it own way , he-he-h ! ” porfiri petrovitch took breath a moment . he had simpli babbl on utter empti phrase , let slip a few enigmat word and again revert to incoher . he wa almost run about the room , move hi fat littl leg quicker and quicker , look at the ground , with hi right hand behind hi back , while with hi left make gesticul that were extraordinarili incongru with hi word . raskolnikov suddenli notic that as he ran about the room he seem twice to stop for a moment near the door , as though he were listen . “ is he expect anyth ? ” “ you are certainli quit right about it , ” porfiri began gaili , look with extraordinari simplic at raskolnikov ( which startl him and instantli put him on hi guard ) ; “ certainli quit right in laugh so wittili at our legal form , he-h ! some of these elabor psycholog method are exceedingli ridicul and perhap useless , if one adher too close to the form . ye ... i am talk of form again . well , if i recognis , or more strictli speak , if i suspect someon or other to be a crimin in ani case entrust to me ... you ’ re read for the law , of cours , rodion romanovitch ? ” “ ye , i wa ... ” “ well , then it is a preced for you for the futur -- though don ’ t suppos i should ventur to instruct you after the articl you publish about crime ! no , i simpli make bold to state it by way of fact , if i took thi man or that for a crimin , whi , i ask , should i worri him prematur , even though i had evid against him ? in one case i may be bound , for instanc , to arrest a man at onc , but anoth may be in quit a differ posit , you know , so whi shouldn ’ t i let him walk about the town a bit ? he-he-h ! but i see you don ’ t quit understand , so i ’ ll give you a clearer exampl . if i put him in prison too soon , i may veri like give him , so to speak , moral support , he-h ! you ’ re laugh ? ” raskolnikov had no idea of laugh . he wa sit with compress lip , hi feverish eye fix on porfiri petrovitch ’ s . “ yet that is the case , with some type especi , for men are so differ . you say ‘ evid ’ . well , there may be evid . but evid , you know , can gener be taken two way . i am an examin lawyer and a weak man , i confess it . i should like to make a proof , so to say , mathemat clear . i should like to make a chain of evid such as twice two are four , it ought to be a direct , irrefut proof ! and if i shut him up too soon -- even though i might be convinc _he_ wa the man , i should veri like be depriv myself of the mean of get further evid against him . and how ? by give him , so to speak , a definit posit , i shall put him out of suspens and set hi mind at rest , so that he will retreat into hi shell . they say that at sevastopol , soon after alma , the clever peopl were in a terribl fright that the enemi would attack openli and take sevastopol at onc . but when they saw that the enemi prefer a regular sieg , they were delight , i am told and reassur , for the thing would drag on for two month at least . you ’ re laugh , you don ’ t believ me again ? of cours , you ’ re right , too . you ’ re right , you ’ re right . these are special case , i admit . but you must observ thi , my dear rodion romanovitch , the gener case , the case for which all legal form and rule are intend , for which they are calcul and laid down in book , doe not exist at all , for the reason that everi case , everi crime , for instanc , so soon as it actual occur , at onc becom a thoroughli special case and sometim a case unlik ani that ’ s gone befor . veri comic case of that sort sometim occur . if i leav one man quit alon , if i don ’ t touch him and don ’ t worri him , but let him know or at least suspect everi moment that i know all about it and am watch him day and night , and if he is in continu suspicion and terror , he ’ ll be bound to lose hi head . he ’ ll come of himself , or mayb do someth which will make it as plain as twice two are four -- it ’ s delight . it may be so with a simpl peasant , but with one of our sort , an intellig man cultiv on a certain side , it ’ s a dead certainti . for , my dear fellow , it ’ s a veri import matter to know on what side a man is cultiv . and then there are nerv , there are nerv , you have overlook them ! whi , they are all sick , nervou and irrit ! ... and then how they all suffer from spleen ! that i assur you is a regular gold-min for us . and it ’ s no anxieti to me , hi run about the town free ! let him , let him walk about for a bit ! i know well enough that i ’ ve caught him and that he won ’ t escap me . where could he escap to , he-h ? abroad , perhap ? a pole will escap abroad , but not here , especi as i am watch and have taken measur . will he escap into the depth of the countri perhap ? but you know , peasant live there , real rude russian peasant . a modern cultiv man would prefer prison to live with such stranger as our peasant . he-h ! but that ’ s all nonsens , and on the surfac . it ’ s not mere that he ha nowher to run to , he is _psychologically_ unabl to escap me , he-h ! what an express ! through a law of natur he can ’ t escap me if he had anywher to go . have you seen a butterfli round a candl ? that ’ s how he will keep circl and circl round me . freedom will lose it attract . he ’ ll begin to brood , he ’ ll weav a tangl round himself , he ’ ll worri himself to death ! what ’ s more he will provid me with a mathemat proof -- if i onli give him long enough interv .... and he ’ ll keep circl round me , get nearer and nearer and then -- flop ! he ’ ll fli straight into my mouth and i ’ ll swallow him , and that will be veri amus , he-he-h ! you don ’ t believ me ? ” raskolnikov made no repli ; he sat pale and motionless , still gaze with the same intens into porfiri ’ s face . “ it ’ s a lesson , ” he thought , turn cold . “ thi is beyond the cat play with a mous , like yesterday . he can ’ t be show off hi power with no motiv ... prompt me ; he is far too clever for that ... he must have anoth object . what is it ? it ’ s all nonsens , my friend , you are pretend , to scare me ! you ’ ve no proof and the man i saw had no real exist . you simpli want to make me lose my head , to work me up beforehand and so to crush me . but you are wrong , you won ’ t do it ! but whi give me such a hint ? is he reckon on my shatter nerv ? no , my friend , you are wrong , you won ’ t do it even though you have some trap for me ... let us see what you have in store for me. ” and he brace himself to face a terribl and unknown ordeal . at time he long to fall on porfiri and strangl him . thi anger wa what he dread from the begin . he felt that hi parch lip were fleck with foam , hi heart wa throb . but he wa still determin not to speak till the right moment . he realis that thi wa the best polici in hi posit , becaus instead of say too much he would be irrit hi enemi by hi silenc and provok him into speak too freeli . anyhow , thi wa what he hope for . “ no , i see you don ’ t believ me , you think i am play a harmless joke on you , ” porfiri began again , get more and more live , chuckl at everi instant and again pace round the room . “ and to be sure you ’ re right : god ha given me a figur that can awaken none but comic idea in other peopl ; a buffoon ; but let me tell you , and i repeat it , excus an old man , my dear rodion romanovitch , you are a man still young , so to say , in your first youth and so you put intellect abov everyth , like all young peopl . play wit and abstract argument fascin you and that ’ s for all the world like the old austrian _hof-kriegsrath_ , as far as i can judg of militari matter , that is : on paper they ’ d beaten napoleon and taken him prison , and there in their studi they work it all out in the cleverest fashion , but look you , gener mack surrend with all hi armi , he-he-h ! i see , i see , rodion romanovitch , you are laugh at a civilian like me , take exampl out of militari histori ! but i can ’ t help it , it ’ s my weak . i am fond of militari scienc . and i ’ m ever so fond of read all militari histori . i ’ ve certainli miss my proper career . i ought to have been in the armi , upon my word i ought . i shouldn ’ t have been a napoleon , but i might have been a major , he-h ! well , i ’ ll tell you the whole truth , my dear fellow , about thi _special case_ , i mean : actual fact and a man ’ s tempera , my dear sir , are weighti matter and it ’ s astonish how they sometim deceiv the sharpest calcul ! i -- listen to an old man -- am speak serious , rodion romanovitch ” ( as he said thi porfiri petrovitch , who wa scarc five-and-thirti , actual seem to have grown old ; even hi voic chang and he seem to shrink togeth ) “ moreov , i ’ m a candid man ... am i a candid man or not ? what do you say ? i fanci i realli am : i tell you these thing for noth and don ’ t even expect a reward for it , he-h ! well , to proceed , wit in my opinion is a splendid thing , it is , so to say , an adorn of natur and a consol of life , and what trick it can play ! so that it sometim is hard for a poor examin lawyer to know where he is , especi when he ’ s liabl to be carri away by hi own fanci , too , for you know he is a man after all ! but the poor fellow is save by the crimin ’ s tempera , wors luck for him ! but young peopl carri away by their own wit don ’ t think of that ‘ when they overstep all obstacl , ’ as you wittili and cleverli express it yesterday . he will lie -- that is , the man who is a _special case_ , the incognito , and he will lie well , in the cleverest fashion ; you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruit of hi wit , but at the most interest , the most flagrant moment he will faint . of cours there may be ill and a stuffi room as well , but anyway ! anyway he ’ s given us the idea ! he lie incompar , but he didn ’ t reckon on hi tempera . that ’ s what betray him ! anoth time he will be carri away by hi play wit into make fun of the man who suspect him , he will turn pale as it were on purpos to mislead , but hi pale will be _too natural_ , too much like the real thing , again he ha given us an idea ! though hi question may be deceiv at first , he will think differ next day if he is not a fool , and , of cours , it is like that at everi step ! he put himself forward where he is not want , speak continu when he ought to keep silent , bring in all sort of allegor allus , he-h ! come and ask whi didn ’ t you take me long ago ? he-he-h ! and that can happen , you know , with the cleverest man , the psychologist , the literari man . the tempera reflect everyth like a mirror ! gaze into it and admir what you see ! but whi are you so pale , rodion romanovitch ? is the room stuffi ? shall i open the window ? ” “ oh , don ’ t troubl , pleas , ” cri raskolnikov and he suddenli broke into a laugh . “ pleas don ’ t trouble. ” porfiri stood face him , paus a moment and suddenli he too laugh . raskolnikov got up from the sofa , abruptli check hi hyster laughter . “ porfiri petrovitch , ” he began , speak loudli and distinctli , though hi leg trembl and he could scarc stand . “ i see clearli at last that you actual suspect me of murder that old woman and her sister lizaveta . let me tell you for my part that i am sick of thi . if you find that you have a right to prosecut me legal , to arrest me , then prosecut me , arrest me . but i will not let myself be jeer at to my face and worri ... ” hi lip trembl , hi eye glow with furi and he could not restrain hi voic . “ i won ’ t allow it ! ” he shout , bring hi fist down on the tabl . “ do you hear that , porfiri petrovitch ? i won ’ t allow it. ” “ good heaven ! what doe it mean ? ” cri porfiri petrovitch , appar quit frighten . “ rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow , what is the matter with you ? ” “ i won ’ t allow it , ” raskolnikov shout again . “ hush , my dear man ! they ’ ll hear and come in . just think , what could we say to them ? ” porfiri petrovitch whisper in horror , bring hi face close to raskolnikov ’ s . “ i won ’ t allow it , i won ’ t allow it , ” raskolnikov repeat mechan , but he too spoke in a sudden whisper . porfiri turn quickli and ran to open the window . “ some fresh air ! and you must have some water , my dear fellow . you ’ re ill ! ” and he wa run to the door to call for some when he found a decant of water in the corner . “ come , drink a littl , ” he whisper , rush up to him with the decant . “ it will be sure to do you good. ” porfiri petrovitch ’ s alarm and sympathi were so natur that raskolnikov wa silent and began look at him with wild curios . he did not take the water , howev . “ rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow , you ’ ll drive yourself out of your mind , i assur you , ach , ach ! have some water , do drink a little. ” he forc him to take the glass . raskolnikov rais it mechan to hi lip , but set it on the tabl again with disgust . “ ye , you ’ ve had a littl attack ! you ’ ll bring back your ill again , my dear fellow , ” porfiri petrovitch cackl with friendli sympathi , though he still look rather disconcert . “ good heaven , you must take more care of yourself ! dmitri prokofitch wa here , came to see me yesterday -- i know , i know , i ’ ve a nasti , iron temper , but what they made of it ! ... good heaven , he came yesterday after you ’ d been . we dine and he talk and talk away , and i could onli throw up my hand in despair ! did he come from you ? but do sit down , for merci ’ s sake , sit down ! ” “ no , not from me , but i knew he went to you and whi he went , ” raskolnikov answer sharpli . “ you knew ? ” “ i knew . what of it ? ” “ whi thi , rodion romanovitch , that i know more than that about you ; i know about everyth . i know how you went _to take a flat_ at night when it wa dark and how you rang the bell and ask about the blood , so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it . ye , i understand your state of mind at that time ... but you ’ ll drive yourself mad like that , upon my word ! you ’ ll lose your head ! you ’ re full of gener indign at the wrong you ’ ve receiv , first from destini , and then from the polic offic , and so you rush from one thing to anoth to forc them to speak out and make an end of it all , becaus you are sick of all thi suspicion and foolish . that ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? i have guess how you feel , haven ’ t i ? onli in that way you ’ ll lose your head and razumihin ’ s , too ; he ’ s too _good_ a man for such a posit , you must know that . you are ill and he is good and your ill is infecti for him ... i ’ ll tell you about it when you are more yourself .... but do sit down , for good ’ sake . pleas rest , you look shock , do sit down. ” raskolnikov sat down ; he no longer shiver , he wa hot all over . in amaz he listen with strain attent to porfiri petrovitch who still seem frighten as he look after him with friendli solicitud . but he did not believ a word he said , though he felt a strang inclin to believ . porfiri ’ s unexpect word about the flat had utterli overwhelm him . “ how can it be , he know about the flat then , ” he thought suddenli , “ and he tell it me himself ! ” “ ye , in our legal practic there wa a case almost exactli similar , a case of morbid psycholog , ” porfiri went on quickli . “ a man confess to murder and how he kept it up ! it wa a regular hallucin ; he brought forward fact , he impos upon everyon and whi ? he had been partli , but onli partli , unintent the caus of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murder the opportun , he sank into deject , it got on hi mind and turn hi brain , he began imagin thing and he persuad himself that he wa the murder . but at last the high court of appeal went into it and the poor fellow wa acquit and put under proper care . thank to the court of appeal ! tut-tut-tut ! whi , my dear fellow , you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impuls to work upon your nerv , to go ring bell at night and ask about blood ! i ’ ve studi all thi morbid psycholog in my practic . a man is sometim tempt to jump out of a window or from a belfri . just the same with bell-ring .... it ’ s all ill , rodion romanovitch ! you have begun to neglect your ill . you should consult an experienc doctor , what ’ s the good of that fat fellow ? you are lighthead ! you were deliri when you did all thi ! ” for a moment raskolnikov felt everyth go round . “ is it possibl , is it possibl , ” flash through hi mind , “ that he is still lie ? he can ’ t be , he can ’ t be. ” he reject that idea , feel to what a degre of furi it might drive him , feel that that furi might drive him mad . “ i wa not deliri . i knew what i wa do , ” he cri , strain everi faculti to penetr porfiri ’ s game , “ i wa quit myself , do you hear ? ” “ ye , i hear and understand . you said yesterday you were not deliri , you were particularli emphat about it ! i understand all you can tell me ! a-ach ! ... listen , rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow . if you were actual a crimin , or were somehow mix up in thi damnabl busi , would you insist that you were not deliri but in full possess of your faculti ? and so emphat and persist ? would it be possibl ? quit imposs , to my think . if you had anyth on your conscienc , you certainli ought to insist that you were deliri . that ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? ” there wa a note of slyness in thi inquiri . raskolnikov drew back on the sofa as porfiri bent over him and stare in silent perplex at him . “ anoth thing about razumihin -- you certainli ought to have said that he came of hi own accord , to have conceal your part in it ! but you don ’ t conceal it ! you lay stress on hi come at your instigation. ” raskolnikov had not done so . a chill went down hi back . “ you keep tell lie , ” he said slowli and weakli , twist hi lip into a sickli smile , “ you are tri again to show that you know all my game , that you know all i shall say beforehand , ” he said , consciou himself that he wa not weigh hi word as he ought . “ you want to frighten me ... or you are simpli laugh at me ... ” he still stare at him as he said thi and again there wa a light of intens hatr in hi eye . “ you keep lie , ” he said . “ you know perfectli well that the best polici for the crimin is to tell the truth as nearli as possibl ... to conceal as littl as possibl . i don ’ t believ you ! ” “ what a wili person you are ! ” porfiri titter , “ there ’ s no catch you ; you ’ ve a perfect monomania . so you don ’ t believ me ? but still you do believ me , you believ a quarter ; i ’ ll soon make you believ the whole , becaus i have a sincer like for you and genuin wish you good. ” raskolnikov ’ s lip trembl . “ ye , i do , ” went on porfiri , touch raskolnikov ’ s arm genial , “ you must take care of your ill . besid , your mother and sister are here now ; you must think of them . you must sooth and comfort them and you do noth but frighten them ... ” “ what ha that to do with you ? how do you know it ? what concern is it of your ? you are keep watch on me and want to let me know it ? ” “ good heaven ! whi , i learnt it all from you yourself ! you don ’ t notic that in your excit you tell me and other everyth . from razumihin , too , i learnt a number of interest detail yesterday . no , you interrupt me , but i must tell you that , for all your wit , your suspici make you lose the common-sens view of thing . to return to bell-ring , for instanc . i , an examin lawyer , have betray a preciou thing like that , a real fact ( for it is a fact worth have ) , and you see noth in it ! whi , if i had the slightest suspicion of you , should i have act like that ? no , i should first have disarm your suspicion and not let you see i knew of that fact , should have divert your attent and suddenli have dealt you a knock-down blow ( your express ) say : ‘ and what were you do , sir , pray , at ten or nearli eleven at the murder woman ’ s flat and whi did you ring the bell and whi did you ask about blood ? and whi did you invit the porter to go with you to the polic station , to the lieuten ? ’ that ’ s how i ought to have act if i had a grain of suspicion of you . i ought to have taken your evid in due form , search your lodg and perhap have arrest you , too ... so i have no suspicion of you , sinc i have not done that ! but you can ’ t look at it normal and you see noth , i say again. ” raskolnikov start so that porfiri petrovitch could not fail to perceiv it . “ you are lie all the while , ” he cri , “ i don ’ t know your object , but you are lie . you did not speak like that just now and i can not be mistaken ! ” “ i am lie ? ” porfiri repeat , appar incens , but preserv a good-humour and iron face , as though he were not in the least concern at raskolnikov ’ s opinion of him . “ i am lie ... but how did i treat you just now , i , the examin lawyer ? prompt you and give you everi mean for your defenc ; ill , i said , delirium , injuri , melancholi and the polic offic and all the rest of it ? ah ! he-he-h ! though , inde , all those psycholog mean of defenc are not veri reliabl and cut both way : ill , delirium , i don ’ t rememb -- that ’ s all right , but whi , my good sir , in your ill and in your delirium were you haunt by just those delus and not by ani other ? there may have been other , eh ? he-he-h ! ” raskolnikov look haughtili and contemptu at him . “ briefli , ” he said loudli and imperi , rise to hi feet and in so do push porfiri back a littl , “ briefli , i want to know , do you acknowledg me perfectli free from suspicion or not ? tell me , porfiri petrovitch , tell me onc for all and make hast ! ” “ what a busi i ’ m have with you ! ” cri porfiri with a perfectli good-humour , sli and compos face . “ and whi do you want to know , whi do you want to know so much , sinc they haven ’ t begun to worri you ? whi , you are like a child ask for match ! and whi are you so uneasi ? whi do you forc yourself upon us , eh ? he-he-h ! ” “ i repeat , ” raskolnikov cri furious , “ that i can ’ t put up with it ! ” “ with what ? uncertainti ? ” interrupt porfiri . “ don ’ t jeer at me ! i won ’ t have it ! i tell you i won ’ t have it . i can ’ t and i won ’ t , do you hear , do you hear ? ” he shout , bring hi fist down on the tabl again . “ hush ! hush ! they ’ ll overhear ! i warn you serious , take care of yourself . i am not joke , ” porfiri whisper , but thi time there wa not the look of old womanish good natur and alarm in hi face . now he wa peremptori , stern , frown and for onc lay asid all mystif . but thi wa onli for an instant . raskolnikov , bewild , suddenli fell into actual frenzi , but , strang to say , he again obey the command to speak quietli , though he wa in a perfect paroxysm of furi . “ i will not allow myself to be tortur , ” he whisper , instantli recognis with hatr that he could not help obey the command and driven to even greater furi by the thought . “ arrest me , search me , but kindli act in due form and don ’ t play with me ! don ’ t dare ! ” “ don ’ t worri about the form , ” porfiri interrupt with the same sli smile , as it were , gloat with enjoy over raskolnikov . “ i invit you to see me quit in a friendli way. ” “ i don ’ t want your friendship and i spit on it ! do you hear ? and , here , i take my cap and go . what will you say now if you mean to arrest me ? ” he took up hi cap and went to the door . “ and won ’ t you see my littl surpris ? ” chuckl porfiri , again take him by the arm and stop him at the door . he seem to becom more play and good-humour which madden raskolnikov . “ what surpris ? ” he ask , stand still and look at porfiri in alarm . “ my littl surpris , it ’ s sit there behind the door , he-he-h ! ” ( he point to the lock door . ) “ i lock him in that he should not escape. ” “ what is it ? where ? what ? ... ” raskolnikov walk to the door and would have open it , but it wa lock . “ it ’ s lock , here is the key ! ” and he brought a key out of hi pocket . “ you are lie , ” roar raskolnikov without restraint , “ you lie , you damn punchinello ! ” and he rush at porfiri who retreat to the other door , not at all alarm . “ i understand it all ! you are lie and mock so that i may betray myself to you ... ” “ whi , you could not betray yourself ani further , my dear rodion romanovitch . you are in a passion . don ’ t shout , i shall call the clerks. ” “ you are lie ! call the clerk ! you knew i wa ill and tri to work me into a frenzi to make me betray myself , that wa your object ! produc your fact ! i understand it all . you ’ ve no evid , you have onli wretch rubbishli suspicion like zametov ’ s ! you knew my charact , you want to drive me to furi and then to knock me down with priest and deputi .... are you wait for them ? eh ! what are you wait for ? where are they ? produc them ? ” “ whi deputi , my good man ? what thing peopl will imagin ! and to do so would not be act in form as you say , you don ’ t know the busi , my dear fellow .... and there ’ s no escap form , as you see , ” porfiri mutter , listen at the door through which a nois could be heard . “ ah , they ’ re come , ” cri raskolnikov . “ you ’ ve sent for them ! you expect them ! well , produc them all : your deputi , your wit , what you like ! ... i am readi ! ” but at thi moment a strang incid occur , someth so unexpect that neither raskolnikov nor porfiri petrovitch could have look for such a conclus to their interview . chapter vi when he rememb the scene afterward , thi is how raskolnikov saw it . the nois behind the door increas , and suddenli the door wa open a littl . “ what is it ? ” cri porfiri petrovitch , annoy . “ whi , i gave order ... ” for an instant there wa no answer , but it wa evid that there were sever person at the door , and that they were appar push somebodi back . “ what is it ? ” porfiri petrovitch repeat , uneasili . “ the prison nikolay ha been brought , ” someon answer . “ he is not want ! take him away ! let him wait ! what ’ s he do here ? how irregular ! ” cri porfiri , rush to the door . “ but he ... ” began the same voic , and suddenli ceas . two second , not more , were spent in actual struggl , then someon gave a violent shove , and then a man , veri pale , strode into the room . thi man ’ s appear wa at first sight veri strang . he stare straight befor him , as though see noth . there wa a determin gleam in hi eye ; at the same time there wa a deathli pallor in hi face , as though he were be led to the scaffold . hi white lip were faintli twitch . he wa dress like a workman and wa of medium height , veri young , slim , hi hair cut in round crop , with thin spare featur . the man whom he had thrust back follow him into the room and succeed in seiz him by the shoulder ; he wa a warder ; but nikolay pull hi arm away . sever person crowd inquisit into the doorway . some of them tri to get in . all thi took place almost instantan . “ go away , it ’ s too soon ! wait till you are sent for ! ... whi have you brought him so soon ? ” porfiri petrovitch mutter , extrem annoy , and as it were thrown out of hi reckon . but nikolay suddenli knelt down . “ what ’ s the matter ? ” cri porfiri , surpris . “ i am guilti ! mine is the sin ! i am the murder , ” nikolay articul suddenli , rather breathless , but speak fairli loudli . for ten second there wa silenc as though all had been struck dumb ; even the warder step back , mechan retreat to the door , and stood immov . “ what is it ? ” cri porfiri petrovitch , recov from hi momentari stupefact . “ i ... am the murder , ” repeat nikolay , after a brief paus . “ what ... you ... what ... whom did you kill ? ” porfiri petrovitch wa obvious bewild . nikolay again wa silent for a moment . “ alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna , i ... kill ... with an axe . dark came over me , ” he ad suddenli , and wa again silent . he still remain on hi knee . porfiri petrovitch stood for some moment as though medit , but suddenli rous himself and wave back the uninvit spectat . they instantli vanish and close the door . then he look toward raskolnikov , who wa stand in the corner , stare wildli at nikolay and move toward him , but stop short , look from nikolay to raskolnikov and then again at nikolay , and seem unabl to restrain himself dart at the latter . “ you ’ re in too great a hurri , ” he shout at him , almost angrili . “ i didn ’ t ask you what came over you .... speak , did you kill them ? ” “ i am the murder .... i want to give evid , ” nikolay pronounc . “ ach ! what did you kill them with ? ” “ an axe . i had it ready. ” “ ach , he is in a hurri ! alon ? ” nikolay did not understand the question . “ did you do it alon ? ” “ ye , alon . and mitka is not guilti and had no share in it. ” “ don ’ t be in a hurri about mitka ! a-ach ! how wa it you ran downstair like that at the time ? the porter met you both ! ” “ it wa to put them off the scent ... i ran after mitka , ” nikolay repli hurriedli , as though he had prepar the answer . “ i knew it ! ” cri porfiri , with vexat . “ it ’ s not hi own tale he is tell , ” he mutter as though to himself , and suddenli hi eye rest on raskolnikov again . he wa appar so taken up with nikolay that for a moment he had forgotten raskolnikov . he wa a littl taken aback . “ my dear rodion romanovitch , excus me ! ” he flew up to him , “ thi won ’ t do ; i ’ m afraid you must go ... it ’ s no good your stay ... i will ... you see , what a surpris ! ... good-by ! ” and take him by the arm , he show him to the door . “ i suppos you didn ’ t expect it ? ” said raskolnikov who , though he had not yet fulli grasp the situat , had regain hi courag . “ you did not expect it either , my friend . see how your hand is trembl ! he-h ! ” “ you ’ re trembl , too , porfiri petrovitch ! ” “ ye , i am ; i didn ’ t expect it. ” they were alreadi at the door ; porfiri wa impati for raskolnikov to be gone . “ and your littl surpris , aren ’ t you go to show it to me ? ” raskolnikov said , sarcast . “ whi , hi teeth are chatter as he ask , he-h ! you are an iron person ! come , till we meet ! ” “ i believ we can say _good-bye_ ! ” “ that ’ s in god ’ s hand , ” mutter porfiri , with an unnatur smile . as he walk through the offic , raskolnikov notic that mani peopl were look at him . among them he saw the two porter from _the_ hous , whom he had invit that night to the polic station . they stood there wait . but he wa no sooner on the stair than he heard the voic of porfiri petrovitch behind him . turn round , he saw the latter run after him , out of breath . “ one word , rodion romanovitch ; as to all the rest , it ’ s in god ’ s hand , but as a matter of form there are some question i shall have to ask you ... so we shall meet again , shan ’ t we ? ” and porfiri stood still , face him with a smile . “ shan ’ t we ? ” he ad again . he seem to want to say someth more , but could not speak out . “ you must forgiv me , porfiri petrovitch , for what ha just pass ... i lost my temper , ” began raskolnikov , who had so far regain hi courag that he felt irresist inclin to display hi cool . “ don ’ t mention it , don ’ t mention it , ” porfiri repli , almost gleefulli . “ i myself , too ... i have a wick temper , i admit it ! but we shall meet again . if it ’ s god ’ s will , we may see a great deal of one another. ” “ and will get to know each other through and through ? ” ad raskolnikov . “ ye ; know each other through and through , ” assent porfiri petrovitch , and he screw up hi eye , look earnestli at raskolnikov . “ now you ’ re go to a birthday parti ? ” “ to a funeral. ” “ of cours , the funer ! take care of yourself , and get well. ” “ i don ’ t know what to wish you , ” said raskolnikov , who had begun to descend the stair , but look back again . “ i should like to wish you success , but your offic is such a comic one. ” “ whi comic ? ” porfiri petrovitch had turn to go , but he seem to prick up hi ear at thi . “ whi , how you must have been tortur and harass that poor nikolay psycholog , after your fashion , till he confess ! you must have been at him day and night , prove to him that he wa the murder , and now that he ha confess , you ’ ll begin vivisect him again . ‘ you are lie , ’ you ’ ll say . ‘ you are not the murder ! you can ’ t be ! it ’ s not your own tale you are tell ! ’ you must admit it ’ s a comic busi ! ” “ he-he-h ! you notic then that i said to nikolay just now that it wa not hi own tale he wa tell ? ” “ how could i help notic it ! ” “ he-h ! you are quick-wit . you notic everyth ! you ’ ve realli a play mind ! and you alway fasten on the comic side ... he-h ! they say that wa the mark characterist of gogol , among the writers. ” “ ye , of gogol. ” “ ye , of gogol .... i shall look forward to meet you. ” “ so shall i. ” raskolnikov walk straight home . he wa so muddl and bewild that on get home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa , tri to collect hi thought . he did not attempt to think about nikolay ; he wa stupefi ; he felt that hi confess wa someth inexplic , amaz -- someth beyond hi understand . but nikolay ’ s confess wa an actual fact . the consequ of thi fact were clear to him at onc , it falsehood could not fail to be discov , and then they would be after him again . till then , at least , he wa free and must do someth for himself , for the danger wa immin . but how immin ? hi posit gradual becam clear to him . rememb , sketchili , the main outlin of hi recent scene with porfiri , he could not help shudder again with horror . of cours , he did not yet know all porfiri ’ s aim , he could not see into all hi calcul . but he had alreadi partli shown hi hand , and no one knew better than raskolnikov how terribl porfiri ’ s “ lead ” had been for him . a littl more and he _might_ have given himself away complet , circumstanti . know hi nervou tempera and from the first glanc see through him , porfiri , though play a bold game , wa bound to win . there ’ s no deni that raskolnikov had compromis himself serious , but no _facts_ had come to light as yet ; there wa noth posit . but wa he take a true view of the posit ? wasn ’ t he mistaken ? what had porfiri been tri to get at ? had he realli some surpris prepar for him ? and what wa it ? had he realli been expect someth or not ? how would they have part if it had not been for the unexpect appear of nikolay ? porfiri had shown almost all hi card -- of cours , he had risk someth in show them -- and if he had realli had anyth up hi sleev ( raskolnikov reflect ) , he would have shown that , too . what wa that “ surpris ” ? wa it a joke ? had it meant anyth ? could it have conceal anyth like a fact , a piec of posit evid ? hi yesterday ’ s visitor ? what had becom of him ? where wa he to-day ? if porfiri realli had ani evid , it must be connect with him .... he sat on the sofa with hi elbow on hi knee and hi face hidden in hi hand . he wa still shiver nervous . at last he got up , took hi cap , thought a minut , and went to the door . he had a sort of presenti that for to-day , at least , he might consid himself out of danger . he had a sudden sens almost of joy ; he want to make hast to katerina ivanovna ’ s . he would be too late for the funer , of cours , but he would be in time for the memori dinner , and there at onc he would see sonia . he stood still , thought a moment , and a suffer smile came for a moment on to hi lip . “ to-day ! to-day , ” he repeat to himself . “ ye , to-day ! so it must be .... ” but as he wa about to open the door , it began open of itself . he start and move back . the door open gentli and slowli , and there suddenli appear a figur -- yesterday ’ s visitor _from underground_ . the man stood in the doorway , look at raskolnikov without speak , and took a step forward into the room . he wa exactli the same as yesterday ; the same figur , the same dress , but there wa a great chang in hi face ; he look deject and sigh deepli . if he had onli put hi hand up to hi cheek and lean hi head on one side he would have look exactli like a peasant woman . “ what do you want ? ” ask raskolnikov , numb with terror . the man wa still silent , but suddenli he bow down almost to the ground , touch it with hi finger . “ what is it ? ” cri raskolnikov . “ i have sin , ” the man articul softli . “ how ? ” “ by evil thoughts. ” they look at one anoth . “ i wa vex . when you came , perhap in drink , and bade the porter go to the polic station and ask about the blood , i wa vex that they let you go and took you for drunken . i wa so vex that i lost my sleep . and rememb the address we came here yesterday and ask for you .... ” “ who came ? ” raskolnikov interrupt , instantli begin to recollect . “ i did , i ’ ve wrong you. ” “ then you come from that hous ? ” “ i wa stand at the gate with them ... don ’ t you rememb ? we have carri on our trade in that hous for year past . we cure and prepar hide , we take work home ... most of all i wa vex .... ” and the whole scene of the day befor yesterday in the gateway came clearli befor raskolnikov ’ s mind ; he recollect that there had been sever peopl there besid the porter , women among them . he rememb one voic had suggest take him straight to the police-st . he could not recal the face of the speaker , and even now he did not recognis it , but he rememb that he had turn round and made him some answer .... so thi wa the solut of yesterday ’ s horror . the most aw thought wa that he had been actual almost lost , had almost done for himself on account of such a _trivial_ circumst . so thi man could tell noth except hi ask about the flat and the blood stain . so porfiri , too , had noth but that _delirium_ , no fact but thi _psychology_ which _cut both ways_ , noth posit . so if no more fact come to light ( and they must not , they must not ! ) then ... then what can they do to him ? how can they convict him , even if they arrest him ? and porfiri then had onli just heard about the flat and had not known about it befor . “ wa it you who told porfiri ... that i ’ d been there ? ” he cri , struck by a sudden idea . “ what porfiri ? ” “ the head of the detect depart ? ” “ ye . the porter did not go there , but i went. ” “ to-day ? ” “ i got there two minut befor you . and i heard , i heard it all , how he worri you. ” “ where ? what ? when ? ” “ whi , in the next room . i wa sit there all the time. ” “ what ? whi , then you were the surpris ? but how could it happen ? upon my word ! ” “ i saw that the porter did not want to do what i said , ” began the man ; “ for it ’ s too late , said they , and mayb he ’ ll be angri that we did not come at the time . i wa vex and i lost my sleep , and i began make inquiri . and find out yesterday where to go , i went to-day . the first time i went he wasn ’ t there , when i came an hour later he couldn ’ t see me . i went the third time , and they show me in . i inform him of everyth , just as it happen , and he began skip about the room and punch himself on the chest . ‘ what do you scoundrel mean by it ? if i ’ d known about it i should have arrest him ! ’ then he ran out , call somebodi and began talk to him in the corner , then he turn to me , scold and question me . he scold me a great deal ; and i told him everyth , and i told him that you didn ’ t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn ’ t recognis me . and he fell to run about again and kept hit himself on the chest , and get angri and run about , and when you were announc he told me to go into the next room . ‘ sit there a bit , ’ he said . ‘ don ’ t move , whatev you may hear. ’ and he set a chair there for me and lock me in . ‘ perhap , ’ he said , ‘ i may call you. ’ and when nikolay ’ d been brought he let me out as soon as you were gone . ‘ i shall send for you again and question you , ’ he said. ” “ and did he question nikolay while you were there ? ” “ he got rid of me as he did of you , befor he spoke to nikolay. ” the man stood still , and again suddenli bow down , touch the ground with hi finger . “ forgiv me for my evil thought , and my slander. ” “ may god forgiv you , ” answer raskolnikov . and as he said thi , the man bow down again , but not to the ground , turn slowli and went out of the room . “ it all cut both way , now it all cut both way , ” repeat raskolnikov , and he went out more confid than ever . “ now we ’ ll make a fight for it , ” he said , with a malici smile , as he went down the stair . hi malic wa aim at himself ; with shame and contempt he recollect hi “ cowardice. ” part v chapter i the morn that follow the fate interview with dounia and her mother brought sober influenc to bear on pyotr petrovitch . intens unpleas as it wa , he wa forc littl by littl to accept as a fact beyond recal what had seem to him onli the day befor fantast and incred . the black snake of wound vaniti had been gnaw at hi heart all night . when he got out of bed , pyotr petrovitch immedi look in the looking-glass . he wa afraid that he had jaundic . howev hi health seem unimpair so far , and look at hi nobl , clear-skin counten which had grown fattish of late , pyotr petrovitch for an instant wa posit comfort in the convict that he would find anoth bride and , perhap , even a better one . but come back to the sens of hi present posit , he turn asid and spat vigor , which excit a sarcast smile in andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov , the young friend with whom he wa stay . that smile pyotr petrovitch notic , and at onc set it down against hi young friend ’ s account . he had set down a good mani point against him of late . hi anger wa redoubl when he reflect that he ought not to have told andrey semyonovitch about the result of yesterday ’ s interview . that wa the second mistak he had made in temper , through impuls and irrit .... moreov , all that morn one unpleas follow anoth . he even found a hitch await him in hi legal case in the senat . he wa particularli irrit by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of hi approach marriag and wa be redecor at hi own expens ; the owner , a rich german tradesman , would not entertain the idea of break the contract which had just been sign and insist on the full forfeit money , though pyotr petrovitch would be give him back the flat practic redecor . in the same way the upholster refus to return a singl roubl of the instal paid for the furnitur purchas but not yet remov to the flat . “ am i to get marri simpli for the sake of the furnitur ? ” pyotr petrovitch ground hi teeth and at the same time onc more he had a gleam of desper hope . “ can all that be realli so irrevoc over ? is it no use to make anoth effort ? ” the thought of dounia sent a voluptu pang through hi heart . he endur anguish at that moment , and if it had been possibl to slay raskolnikov instantli by wish it , pyotr petrovitch would promptli have utter the wish . “ it wa my mistak , too , not to have given them money , ” he thought , as he return dejectedli to lebeziatnikov ’ s room , “ and whi on earth wa i such a jew ? it wa fals economi ! i meant to keep them without a penni so that they should turn to me as their provid , and look at them ! foo ! if i ’ d spent some fifteen hundr roubl on them for the trousseau and present , on knick-knack , dressing-cas , jewelleri , materi , and all that sort of trash from knopp ’ s and the english shop , my posit would have been better and ... stronger ! they could not have refus me so easili ! they are the sort of peopl that would feel bound to return money and present if they broke it off ; and they would find it hard to do it ! and their conscienc would prick them : how can we dismiss a man who ha hitherto been so gener and delic ? .... h ’ m ! i ’ ve made a blunder. ” and grind hi teeth again , pyotr petrovitch call himself a fool -- but not aloud , of cours . he return home , twice as irrit and angri as befor . the prepar for the funer dinner at katerina ivanovna ’ s excit hi curios as he pass . he had heard about it the day befor ; he fanci , inde , that he had been invit , but absorb in hi own care he had paid no attent . inquir of madam lippevechsel who wa busi lay the tabl while katerina ivanovna wa away at the cemeteri , he heard that the entertain wa to be a great affair , that all the lodger had been invit , among them some who had not known the dead man , that even andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov wa invit in spite of hi previou quarrel with katerina ivanovna , that he , pyotr petrovitch , wa not onli invit , but wa eagerli expect as he wa the most import of the lodger . amalia ivanovna herself had been invit with great ceremoni in spite of the recent unpleas , and so she wa veri busi with prepar and wa take a posit pleasur in them ; she wa moreov dress up to the nine , all in new black silk , and she wa proud of it . all thi suggest an idea to pyotr petrovitch and he went into hi room , or rather lebeziatnikov ’ s , somewhat thought . he had learnt that raskolnikov wa to be one of the guest . andrey semyonovitch had been at home all the morn . the attitud of pyotr petrovitch to thi gentleman wa strang , though perhap natur . pyotr petrovitch had despis and hate him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seem somewhat afraid of him . he had not come to stay with him on hi arriv in petersburg simpli from parsimoni , though that had been perhap hi chief object . he had heard of andrey semyonovitch , who had onc been hi ward , as a lead young progress who wa take an import part in certain interest circl , the do of which were a legend in the provinc . it had impress pyotr petrovitch . these power omnisci circl who despis everyon and show everyon up had long inspir in him a peculiar but quit vagu alarm . he had not , of cours , been abl to form even an approxim notion of what they meant . he , like everyon , had heard that there were , especi in petersburg , progress of some sort , nihilist and so on , and , like mani peopl , he exagger and distort the signific of those word to an absurd degre . what for mani year past he had fear more than anyth wa _be shown up_ and thi wa the chief ground for hi continu uneasi at the thought of transfer hi busi to petersburg . he wa afraid of thi as littl children are sometim panic-stricken . some year befor , when he wa just enter on hi own career , he had come upon two case in which rather import personag in the provinc , patron of hi , had been cruelli shown up . one instanc had end in great scandal for the person attack and the other had veri nearli end in seriou troubl . for thi reason pyotr petrovitch intend to go into the subject as soon as he reach petersburg and , if necessari , to anticip conting by seek the favour of “ our younger generation. ” he reli on andrey semyonovitch for thi and befor hi visit to raskolnikov he had succeed in pick up some current phrase . he soon discov that andrey semyonovitch wa a commonplac simpleton , but that by no mean reassur pyotr petrovitch . even if he had been certain that all the progress were fool like him , it would not have allay hi uneasi . all the doctrin , the idea , the system , with which andrey semyonovitch pester him had no interest for him . he had hi own object -- he simpli want to find out at onc what wa happen _here_ . had these peopl ani power or not ? had he anyth to fear from them ? would they expos ani enterpris of hi ? and what precis wa now the object of their attack ? could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they realli were power ? wa thi the thing to do or not ? couldn ’ t he gain someth through them ? in fact hundr of question present themselv . andrey semyonovitch wa an anæmic , scroful littl man , with strang flaxen mutton-chop whisker of which he wa veri proud . he wa a clerk and had almost alway someth wrong with hi eye . he wa rather soft-heart , but self-confid and sometim extrem conceit in speech , which had an absurd effect , incongru with hi littl figur . he wa one of the lodger most respect by amalia ivanovna , for he did not get drunk and paid regularli for hi lodg . andrey semyonovitch realli wa rather stupid ; he attach himself to the caus of progress and “ our younger gener ” from enthusiasm . he wa one of the numer and vari legion of dullard , of half-anim abort , conceit , half-educ coxcomb , who attach themselv to the idea most in fashion onli to vulgaris it and who caricatur everi caus they serv , howev sincer . though lebeziatnikov wa so good-natur , he , too , wa begin to dislik pyotr petrovitch . thi happen on both side unconsci . howev simpl andrey semyonovitch might be , he began to see that pyotr petrovitch wa dupe him and secretli despis him , and that “ he wa not the right sort of man. ” he had tri expound to him the system of fourier and the darwinian theori , but of late pyotr petrovitch began to listen too sarcast and even to be rude . the fact wa he had begun instinct to guess that lebeziatnikov wa not mere a commonplac simpleton , but , perhap , a liar , too , and that he had no connect of ani consequ even in hi own circl , but had simpli pick thing up third-hand ; and that veri like he did not even know much about hi own work of propaganda , for he wa in too great a muddl . a fine person he would be to show anyon up ! it must be note , by the way , that pyotr petrovitch had dure those ten day eagerli accept the strangest prais from andrey semyonovitch ; he had not protest , for instanc , when andrey semyonovitch belaud him for be readi to contribut to the establish of the new “ commun , ” or to abstain from christen hi futur children , or to acquiesc if dounia were to take a lover a month after marriag , and so on . pyotr petrovitch so enjoy hear hi own prais that he did not disdain even such virtu when they were attribut to him . pyotr petrovitch had had occas that morn to realis some five-per-c bond and now he sat down to the tabl and count over bundl of note . andrey semyonovitch who hardli ever had ani money walk about the room pretend to himself to look at all those bank note with indiffer and even contempt . noth would have convinc pyotr petrovitch that andrey semyonovitch could realli look on the money unmov , and the latter , on hi side , kept think bitterli that pyotr petrovitch wa capabl of entertain such an idea about him and wa , perhap , glad of the opportun of teas hi young friend by remind him of hi inferior and the great differ between them . he found him incred inattent and irrit , though he , andrey semyonovitch , began enlarg on hi favourit subject , the foundat of a new special “ commune. ” the brief remark that drop from pyotr petrovitch between the click of the bead on the reckon frame betray unmistak and discourt ironi . but the “ human ” andrey semyonovitch ascrib pyotr petrovitch ’ s ill-humour to hi recent breach with dounia and he wa burn with impati to discours on that theme . he had someth progress to say on the subject which might consol hi worthi friend and “ could not fail ” to promot hi develop . “ there is some sort of festiv be prepar at that ... at the widow ’ s , isn ’ t there ? ” pyotr petrovitch ask suddenli , interrupt andrey semyonovitch at the most interest passag . “ whi , don ’ t you know ? whi , i wa tell you last night what i think about all such ceremoni . and she invit you too , i heard . you were talk to her yesterday ... ” “ i should never have expect that beggarli fool would have spent on thi feast all the money she got from that other fool , raskolnikov . i wa surpris just now as i came through at the prepar there , the wine ! sever peopl are invit . it ’ s beyond everyth ! ” continu pyotr petrovitch , who seem to have some object in pursu the convers . “ what ? you say i am ask too ? when wa that ? i don ’ t rememb . but i shan ’ t go . whi should i ? i onli said a word to her in pass yesterday of the possibl of her obtain a year ’ s salari as a destitut widow of a govern clerk . i suppos she ha invit me on that account , hasn ’ t she ? he-he-h ! ” “ i don ’ t intend to go either , ” said lebeziatnikov . “ i should think not , after give her a thrash ! you might well hesit , he-h ! ” “ who thrash ? whom ? ” cri lebeziatnikov , fluster and blush . “ whi , you thrash katerina ivanovna a month ago . i heard so yesterday ... so that ’ s what your convict amount to ... and the woman question , too , wasn ’ t quit sound , he-he-h ! ” and pyotr petrovitch , as though comfort , went back to click hi bead . “ it ’ s all slander and nonsens ! ” cri lebeziatnikov , who wa alway afraid of allus to the subject . “ it wa not like that at all , it wa quit differ . you ’ ve heard it wrong ; it ’ s a libel . i wa simpli defend myself . she rush at me first with her nail , she pull out all my whisker .... it ’ s permiss for anyon , i should hope , to defend himself and i never allow anyon to use violenc to me on principl , for it ’ s an act of despot . what wa i to do ? i simpli push her back. ” “ he-he-h ! ” luzhin went on laugh malici . “ you keep on like that becaus you are out of humour yourself .... but that ’ s nonsens and it ha noth , noth whatev to do with the woman question ! you don ’ t understand ; i use to think , inde , that if women are equal to men in all respect , even in strength ( as is maintain now ) there ought to be equal in that , too . of cours , i reflect afterward that such a question ought not realli to aris , for there ought not to be fight and in the futur societi fight is unthink ... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equal in fight . i am not so stupid ... though , of cours , there is fight ... there won ’ t be later , but at present there is ... confound it ! how muddl one get with you ! it ’ s not on that account that i am not go . i am not go on principl , not to take part in the revolt convent of memori dinner , that ’ s whi ! though , of cours , one might go to laugh at it .... i am sorri there won ’ t be ani priest at it . i should certainli go if there were. ” “ then you would sit down at anoth man ’ s tabl and insult it and those who invit you . eh ? ” “ certainli not insult , but protest . i should do it with a good object . i might indirectli assist the caus of enlighten and propaganda . it ’ s a duti of everi man to work for enlighten and propaganda and the more harshli , perhap , the better . i might drop a seed , an idea .... and someth might grow up from that seed . how should i be insult them ? they might be offend at first , but afterward they ’ d see i ’ d done them a servic . you know , terebyeva ( who is in the commun now ) wa blame becaus when she left her famili and ... devot ... herself , she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn ’ t go on live convent and wa enter on a free marriag and it wa said that that wa too harsh , that she might have spare them and have written more kindli . i think that ’ s all nonsens and there ’ s no need of soft ; on the contrari , what ’ s want is protest . varent had been marri seven year , she abandon her two children , she told her husband straight out in a letter : ‘ i have realis that i can not be happi with you . i can never forgiv you that you have deceiv me by conceal from me that there is anoth organis of societi by mean of the commun . i have onli late learn it from a great-heart man to whom i have given myself and with whom i am establish a commun . i speak plainli becaus i consid it dishonest to deceiv you . do as you think best . do not hope to get me back , you are too late . i hope you will be happy. ’ that ’ s how letter like that ought to be written ! ” “ is that terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriag ? ” “ no , it ’ s onli the second , realli ! but what if it were the fourth , what if it were the fifteenth , that ’ s all nonsens ! and if ever i regret the death of my father and mother , it is now , and i sometim think if my parent were live what a protest i would have aim at them ! i would have done someth on purpos ... i would have shown them ! i would have astonish them ! i am realli sorri there is no one ! ” “ to surpris ! he-h ! well , be that as you will , ” pyotr petrovitch interrupt , “ but tell me thi ; do you know the dead man ’ s daughter , the delicate-look littl thing ? it ’ s true what they say about her , isn ’ t it ? ” “ what of it ? i think , that is , it is my own person convict that thi is the normal condit of women . whi not ? i mean , _distinguons_ . in our present societi it is not altogeth normal , becaus it is compulsori , but in the futur societi it will be perfectli normal , becaus it will be voluntari . even as it is , she wa quit right : she wa suffer and that wa her asset , so to speak , her capit which she had a perfect right to dispos of . of cours , in the futur societi there will be no need of asset , but her part will have anoth signific , ration and in harmoni with her environ . as to sofya semyonovna person , i regard her action as a vigor protest against the organis of societi , and i respect her deepli for it ; i rejoic inde when i look at her ! ” “ i wa told that you got her turn out of these lodgings. ” lebeziatnikov wa enrag . “ that ’ s anoth slander , ” he yell . “ it wa not so at all ! that wa all katerina ivanovna ’ s invent , for she did not understand ! and i never made love to sofya semyonovna ! i wa simpli develop her , entir disinterestedli , tri to rous her to protest .... all i want wa her protest and sofya semyonovna could not have remain here anyway ! ” “ have you ask her to join your commun ? ” “ you keep on laugh and veri inappropri , allow me to tell you . you don ’ t understand ! there is no such rôle in a commun . the commun is establish that there should be no such rôle . in a commun , such a rôle is essenti transform and what is stupid here is sensibl there , what , under present condit , is unnatur becom perfectli natur in the commun . it all depend on the environ . it ’ s all the environ and man himself is noth . and i am on good term with sofya semyonovna to thi day , which is a proof that she never regard me as have wrong her . i am tri now to attract her to the commun , but on quit , quit a differ foot . what are you laugh at ? we are tri to establish a commun of our own , a special one , on a broader basi . we have gone further in our convict . we reject more ! and meanwhil i ’ m still develop sofya semyonovna . she ha a beauti , beauti charact ! ” “ and you take advantag of her fine charact , eh ? he-h ! ” “ no , no ! oh , no ! on the contrary. ” “ oh , on the contrari ! he-he-h ! a queer thing to say ! ” “ believ me ! whi should i disguis it ? in fact , i feel it strang myself how timid , chast and modern she is with me ! ” “ and you , of cours , are develop her ... he-h ! tri to prove to her that all that modesti is nonsens ? ” “ not at all , not at all ! how coars , how stupidli -- excus me say so -- you misunderstand the word develop ! good heaven , how ... crude you still are ! we are strive for the freedom of women and you have onli one idea in your head .... set asid the gener question of chastiti and feminin modesti as useless in themselv and inde prejudic , i fulli accept her chastiti with me , becaus that ’ s for her to decid . of cours if she were to tell me herself that she want me , i should think myself veri lucki , becaus i like the girl veri much ; but as it is , no one ha ever treat her more courteous than i , with more respect for her digniti ... i wait in hope , that ’ s all ! ” “ you had much better make her a present of someth . i bet you never thought of that. ” “ you don ’ t understand , as i ’ ve told you alreadi ! of cours , she is in such a posit , but it ’ s anoth question . quit anoth question ! you simpli despis her . see a fact which you mistakenli consid deserv of contempt , you refus to take a human view of a fellow creatur . you don ’ t know what a charact she is ! i am onli sorri that of late she ha quit given up read and borrow book . i use to lend them to her . i am sorri , too , that with all the energi and resolut in protest -- which she ha alreadi shown onc -- she ha littl self-reli , littl , so to say , independ , so as to break free from certain prejudic and certain foolish idea . yet she thoroughli understand some question , for instanc about kiss of hand , that is , that it ’ s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand , becaus it ’ s a sign of inequ . we had a debat about it and i describ it to her . she listen attent to an account of the workmen ’ s associ in franc , too . now i am explain the question of come into the room in the futur society. ” “ and what ’ s that , pray ? ” “ we had a debat late on the question : ha a member of the commun the right to enter anoth member ’ s room , whether man or woman , at ani time ... and we decid that he ha ! ” “ it might be at an inconveni moment , he-h ! ” lebeziatnikov wa realli angri . “ you are alway think of someth unpleas , ” he cri with avers . “ tfoo ! how vex i am that when i wa expound our system , i refer prematur to the question of person privaci ! it ’ s alway a stumbling-block to peopl like you , they turn it into ridicul befor they understand it . and how proud they are of it , too ! tfoo ! i ’ ve often maintain that that question should not be approach by a novic till he ha a firm faith in the system . and tell me , pleas , what do you find so shame even in cesspool ? i should be the first to be readi to clean out ani cesspool you like . and it ’ s not a question of self-sacrific , it ’ s simpli work , honour , use work which is as good as ani other and much better than the work of a raphael and a pushkin , becaus it is more useful. ” “ and more honour , more honour , he-he-h ! ” “ what do you mean by ‘ more honour ’ ? i don ’ t understand such express to describ human activ . ‘ more honour , ’ ‘ nobler ’ -- all those are old-fashion prejudic which i reject . everyth which is _of use_ to mankind is honour . i onli understand one word : _useful_ ! you can snigger as much as you like , but that ’ s so ! ” pyotr petrovitch laugh heartili . he had finish count the money and wa put it away . but some of the note he left on the tabl . the “ cesspool question ” had alreadi been a subject of disput between them . what wa absurd wa that it made lebeziatnikov realli angri , while it amus luzhin and at that moment he particularli want to anger hi young friend . “ it ’ s your ill-luck yesterday that make you so ill-humour and annoy , ” blurt out lebeziatnikov , who in spite of hi “ independ ” and hi “ protest ” did not ventur to oppos pyotr petrovitch and still behav to him with some of the respect habitu in earlier year . “ you ’ d better tell me thi , ” pyotr petrovitch interrupt with haughti displeasur , “ can you ... or rather are you realli friendli enough with that young person to ask her to step in here for a minut ? i think they ’ ve all come back from the cemeteri ... i heard the sound of step ... i want to see her , that young person. ” “ what for ? ” lebeziatnikov ask with surpris . “ oh , i want to . i am leav here to-day or to-morrow and therefor i want to speak to her about ... howev , you may be present dure the interview . it ’ s better you should be , inde . for there ’ s no know what you might imagine. ” “ i shan ’ t imagin anyth . i onli ask and , if you ’ ve anyth to say to her , noth is easier than to call her in . i ’ ll go directli and you may be sure i won ’ t be in your way. ” five minut later lebeziatnikov came in with sonia . she came in veri much surpris and overcom with shyness as usual . she wa alway shi in such circumst and wa alway afraid of new peopl , she had been as a child and wa even more so now .... pyotr petrovitch met her “ polit and affabl , ” but with a certain shade of banter familiar which in hi opinion wa suitabl for a man of hi respect and weight in deal with a creatur so young and so _interesting_ as she . he hasten to “ reassur ” her and made her sit down face him at the tabl . sonia sat down , look about her -- at lebeziatnikov , at the note lie on the tabl and then again at pyotr petrovitch and her eye remain rivet on him . lebeziatnikov wa move to the door . pyotr petrovitch sign to sonia to remain seat and stop lebeziatnikov . “ is raskolnikov in there ? ha he come ? ” he ask him in a whisper . “ raskolnikov ? ye . whi ? ye , he is there . i saw him just come in .... whi ? ” “ well , i particularli beg you to remain here with us and not to leav me alon with thi ... young woman . i onli want a few word with her , but god know what they may make of it . i shouldn ’ t like raskolnikov to repeat anyth .... you understand what i mean ? ” “ i understand ! ” lebeziatnikov saw the point . “ ye , you are right .... of cours , i am convinc person that you have no reason to be uneasi , but ... still , you are right . certainli i ’ ll stay . i ’ ll stand here at the window and not be in your way ... i think you are right ... ” pyotr petrovitch return to the sofa , sat down opposit sonia , look attent at her and assum an extrem dignifi , even sever express , as much as to say , “ don ’ t you make ani mistak , madam. ” sonia wa overwhelm with embarrass . “ in the first place , sofya semyonovna , will you make my excus to your respect mamma .... that ’ s right , isn ’ t it ? katerina ivanovna stand in the place of a mother to you ? ” pyotr petrovitch began with great digniti , though affabl . it wa evid that hi intent were friendli . “ quit so , ye ; the place of a mother , ” sonia answer , timidli and hurriedli . “ then will you make my apolog to her ? through inevit circumst i am forc to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma ’ s kind invitation. ” “ ye ... i ’ ll tell her ... at once. ” and sonia hastili jump up from her seat . “ wait , that ’ s not all , ” pyotr petrovitch detain her , smile at her simplic and ignor of good manner , “ and you know me littl , my dear sofya semyonovna , if you suppos i would have ventur to troubl a person like you for a matter of so littl consequ affect myself onli . i have anoth object. ” sonia sat down hurriedli . her eye rest again for an instant on the grey-and-rainbow-colour note that remain on the tabl , but she quickli look away and fix her eye on pyotr petrovitch . she felt it horribl indecor , especi for _her_ , to look at anoth person ’ s money . she stare at the gold eye-glass which pyotr petrovitch held in hi left hand and at the massiv and extrem handsom ring with a yellow stone on hi middl finger . but suddenli she look away and , not know where to turn , end by stare pyotr petrovitch again straight in the face . after a paus of still greater digniti he continu . “ i chanc yesterday in pass to exchang a coupl of word with katerina ivanovna , poor woman . that wa suffici to enabl me to ascertain that she is in a posit -- preternatur , if one may so express it. ” “ ye ... preternatur ... ” sonia hurriedli assent . “ or it would be simpler and more comprehens to say , ill. ” “ ye , simpler and more comprehen ... ye , ill. ” “ quit so . so then from a feel of human and so to speak compass , i should be glad to be of servic to her in ani way , forese her unfortun posit . i believ the whole of thi poverty-stricken famili depend now entir on you ? ” “ allow me to ask , ” sonia rose to her feet , “ did you say someth to her yesterday of the possibl of a pension ? becaus she told me you had undertaken to get her one . wa that true ? ” “ not in the slightest , and inde it ’ s an absurd ! i mere hint at her obtain temporari assist as the widow of an offici who had die in the servic -- if onli she ha patronag ... but appar your late parent had not serv hi full term and had not inde been in the servic at all of late . in fact , if there could be ani hope , it would be veri ephemer , becaus there would be no claim for assist in that case , far from it .... and she is dream of a pension alreadi , he-he-h ! ... a go-ahead ladi ! ” “ ye , she is . for she is credul and good-heart , and she believ everyth from the good of her heart and ... and ... and she is like that ... ye ... you must excus her , ” said sonia , and again she got up to go . “ but you haven ’ t heard what i have to say. ” “ no , i haven ’ t heard , ” mutter sonia . “ then sit down. ” she wa terribl confus ; she sat down again a third time . “ see her posit with her unfortun littl one , i should be glad , as i have said befor , so far as lie in my power , to be of servic , that is , so far as is in my power , not more . one might for instanc get up a subscript for her , or a lotteri , someth of the sort , such as is alway arrang in such case by friend or even outsid desir of assist peopl . it wa of that i intend to speak to you ; it might be done. ” “ ye , ye ... god will repay you for it , ” falter sonia , gaze intent at pyotr petrovitch . “ it might be , but we will talk of it later . we might begin it to-day , we will talk it over thi even and lay the foundat so to speak . come to me at seven o ’ clock . mr. lebeziatnikov , i hope , will assist us . but there is one circumst of which i ought to warn you beforehand and for which i ventur to troubl you , sofya semyonovna , to come here . in my opinion money can not be , inde it ’ s unsaf to put it into katerina ivanovna ’ s own hand . the dinner to-day is a proof of that . though she ha not , so to speak , a crust of bread for to-morrow and ... well , boot or shoe , or anyth ; she ha bought to-day jamaica rum , and even , i believ , madeira and ... and coffe . i saw it as i pass through . to-morrow it will all fall upon you again , they won ’ t have a crust of bread . it ’ s absurd , realli , and so , to my think , a subscript ought to be rais so that the unhappi widow should not know of the money , but onli you , for instanc . am i right ? ” “ i don ’ t know ... thi is onli to-day , onc in her life .... she wa so anxiou to do honour , to celebr the memori .... and she is veri sensibl ... but just as you think and i shall be veri , veri ... they will all be ... and god will reward ... and the orphan ... ” sonia burst into tear . “ veri well , then , keep it in mind ; and now will you accept for the benefit of your relat the small sum that i am abl to spare , from me person . i am veri anxiou that my name should not be mention in connect with it . here ... have so to speak anxieti of my own , i can not do more ... ” and pyotr petrovitch held out to sonia a ten-roubl note care unfold . sonia took it , flush crimson , jump up , mutter someth and began take leav . pyotr petrovitch accompani her ceremoni to the door . she got out of the room at last , agit and distress , and return to katerina ivanovna , overwhelm with confus . all thi time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walk about the room , anxiou not to interrupt the convers ; when sonia had gone he walk up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnli held out hi hand . “ i heard and _saw_ everyth , ” he said , lay stress on the last verb . “ that is honour , i mean to say , it ’ s human ! you want to avoid gratitud , i saw ! and although i can not , i confess , in principl sympathis with privat chariti , for it not onli fail to erad the evil but even promot it , yet i must admit that i saw your action with pleasur -- ye , ye , i like it. ” “ that ’ s all nonsens , ” mutter pyotr petrovitch , somewhat disconcert , look care at lebeziatnikov . “ no , it ’ s not nonsens ! a man who ha suffer distress and annoy as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathis with the miseri of other , such a man ... even though he is make a social mistak -- is still deserv of respect ! i did not expect it inde of you , pyotr petrovitch , especi as accord to your idea ... oh , what a drawback your idea are to you ! how distress you are for instanc by your ill-luck yesterday , ” cri the simple-heart lebeziatnikov , who felt a return of affect for pyotr petrovitch . “ and , what do you want with marriag , with _legal_ marriag , my dear , nobl pyotr petrovitch ? whi do you cling to thi _legality_ of marriag ? well , you may beat me if you like , but i am glad , posit glad it hasn ’ t come off , that you are free , that you are not quit lost for human .... you see , i ’ ve spoken my mind ! ” “ becaus i don ’ t want in your free marriag to be made a fool of and to bring up anoth man ’ s children , that ’ s whi i want legal marriag , ” luzhin repli in order to make some answer . he seem preoccupi by someth . “ children ? you refer to children , ” lebeziatnikov start off like a warhors at the trumpet call . “ children are a social question and a question of first import , i agre ; but the question of children ha anoth solut . some refus to have children altogeth , becaus they suggest the institut of the famili . we ’ ll speak of children later , but now as to the question of honour , i confess that ’ s my weak point . that horrid , militari , pushkin express is unthink in the dictionari of the futur . what doe it mean inde ? it ’ s nonsens , there will be no decept in a free marriag ! that is onli the natur consequ of a legal marriag , so to say , it correct , a protest . so that inde it ’ s not humili ... and if i ever , to suppos an absurd , were to be legal marri , i should be posit glad of it . i should say to my wife : ‘ my dear , hitherto i have love you , now i respect you , for you ’ ve shown you can protest ! ’ you laugh ! that ’ s becaus you are incap of get away from prejudic . confound it all ! i understand now where the unpleas is of be deceiv in a legal marriag , but it ’ s simpli a despic consequ of a despic posit in which both are humili . when the decept is open , as in a free marriag , then it doe not exist , it ’ s unthink . your wife will onli prove how she respect you by consid you incap of oppos her happi and aveng yourself on her for her new husband . damn it all ! i sometim dream if i were to be marri , pfoo ! i mean if i were to marri , legal or not , it ’ s just the same , i should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself . ‘ my dear , ’ i should say , ‘ i love you , but even more than that i desir you to respect me . see ! ’ am i not right ? ” pyotr petrovitch snigger as he listen , but without much merriment . he hardli heard it inde . he wa preoccupi with someth els and even lebeziatnikov at last notic it . pyotr petrovitch seem excit and rub hi hand . lebeziatnikov rememb all thi and reflect upon it afterward . chapter ii it would be difficult to explain exactli what could have origin the idea of that senseless dinner in katerina ivanovna ’ s disord brain . nearli ten of the twenti roubl , given by raskolnikov for marmeladov ’ s funer , were wast upon it . possibl katerina ivanovna felt oblig to honour the memori of the deceas “ suitabl , ” that all the lodger , and still more amalia ivanovna , might know “ that he wa in no way their inferior , and perhap veri much their superior , ” and that no one had the right “ to turn up hi nose at him. ” perhap the chief element wa that peculiar “ poor man ’ s pride , ” which compel mani poor peopl to spend their last save on some tradit social ceremoni , simpli in order to do “ like other peopl , ” and not to “ be look down upon. ” it is veri probabl , too , that katerina ivanovna long on thi occas , at the moment when she seem to be abandon by everyon , to show those “ wretch contempt lodger ” that she knew “ how to do thing , how to entertain ” and that she had been brought up “ in a genteel , she might almost say aristocrat colonel ’ s famili ” and had not been meant for sweep floor and wash the children ’ s rag at night . even the poorest and most broken-spirit peopl are sometim liabl to these paroxysm of pride and vaniti which take the form of an irresist nervou crave . and katerina ivanovna wa not broken-spirit ; she might have been kill by circumst , but her spirit could not have been broken , that is , she could not have been intimid , her will could not be crush . moreov sonia had said with good reason that her mind wa unhing . she could not be said to be insan , but for a year past she had been so harass that her mind might well be overstrain . the later stage of consumpt are apt , doctor tell us , to affect the intellect . there wa no great varieti of wine , nor wa there madeira ; but wine there wa . there wa vodka , rum and lisbon wine , all of the poorest qualiti but in suffici quantiti . besid the tradit rice and honey , there were three or four dish , one of which consist of pancak , all prepar in amalia ivanovna ’ s kitchen . two samovar were boil , that tea and punch might be offer after dinner . katerina ivanovna had herself seen to purchas the provis , with the help of one of the lodger , an unfortun littl pole who had somehow been strand at madam lippevechsel ’ s . he promptli put himself at katerina ivanovna ’ s dispos and had been all that morn and all the day befor run about as fast as hi leg could carri him , and veri anxiou that everyon should be awar of it . for everi trifl he ran to katerina ivanovna , even hunt her out at the bazaar , at everi instant call her “ _pani_. ” she wa heartili sick of him befor the end , though she had declar at first that she could not have got on without thi “ servic and magnanim man. ” it wa one of katerina ivanovna ’ s characterist to paint everyon she met in the most glow colour . her prais were so exagger as sometim to be embarrass ; she would invent variou circumst to the credit of her new acquaint and quit genuin believ in their realiti . then all of a sudden she would be disillus and would rude and contemptu repuls the person she had onli a few hour befor been liter ador . she wa natur of a gay , live and peace-lov disposit , but from continu failur and misfortun she had come to desir so _keenly_ that all should live in peac and joy and should not _dare_ to break the peac , that the slightest jar , the smallest disast reduc her almost to frenzi , and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hope and fanci to curs her fate and rave , and knock her head against the wall . amalia ivanovna , too , suddenli acquir extraordinari import in katerina ivanovna ’ s eye and wa treat by her with extraordinari respect , probabl onli becaus amalia ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the prepar . she had undertaken to lay the tabl , to provid the linen , crockeri , etc. , and to cook the dish in her kitchen , and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hand and gone herself to the cemeteri . everyth had been well done . even the table-cloth wa nearli clean ; the crockeri , knive , fork and glass were , of cours , of all shape and pattern , lent by differ lodger , but the tabl wa properli laid at the time fix , and amalia ivanovna , feel she had done her work well , had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourn ribbon and met the return parti with some pride . thi pride , though justifi , displeas katerina ivanovna for some reason : “ as though the tabl could not have been laid except by amalia ivanovna ! ” she dislik the cap with new ribbon , too . “ could she be stuck up , the stupid german , becaus she wa mistress of the hous , and had consent as a favour to help her poor lodger ! as a favour ! fanci that ! katerina ivanovna ’ s father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometim had the tabl set for forti person , and then anyon like amalia ivanovna , or rather ludwigovna , would not have been allow into the kitchen. ” katerina ivanovna , howev , put off express her feel for the time and content herself with treat her coldli , though she decid inwardli that she would certainli have to put amalia ivanovna down and set her in her proper place , for good onli knew what she wa fanci herself . katerina ivanovna wa irrit too by the fact that hardli ani of the lodger invit had come to the funer , except the pole who had just manag to run into the cemeteri , while to the memori dinner the poorest and most insignific of them had turn up , the wretch creatur , mani of them not quit sober . the older and more respect of them all , as if by common consent , stay away . pyotr petrovitch luzhin , for instanc , who might be said to be the most respect of all the lodger , did not appear , though katerina ivanovna had the even befor told all the world , that is amalia ivanovna , polenka , sonia and the pole , that he wa the most gener , noble-heart man with a larg properti and vast connect , who had been a friend of her first husband ’ s , and a guest in her father ’ s hous , and that he had promis to use all hi influenc to secur her a consider pension . it must be note that when katerina ivanovna exalt anyon ’ s connect and fortun , it wa without ani ulterior motiv , quit disinterestedli , for the mere pleasur of ad to the consequ of the person prais . probabl “ take hi cue ” from luzhin , “ that contempt wretch lebeziatnikov had not turn up either . what did he fanci himself ? he wa onli ask out of kind and becaus he wa share the same room with pyotr petrovitch and wa a friend of hi , so that it would have been awkward not to invit him. ” among those who fail to appear were “ the genteel ladi and her old-maidish daughter , ” who had onli been lodger in the hous for the last fortnight , but had sever time complain of the nois and uproar in katerina ivanovna ’ s room , especi when marmeladov had come back drunk . katerina ivanovna heard thi from amalia ivanovna who , quarrel with katerina ivanovna , and threaten to turn the whole famili out of door , had shout at her that they “ were not worth the foot ” of the honour lodger whom they were disturb . katerina ivanovna determin now to invit thi ladi and her daughter , “ whose foot she wa not worth , ” and who had turn away haughtili when she casual met them , so that they might know that “ she wa more nobl in her thought and feel and did not harbour malic , ” and might see that she wa not accustom to her way of live . she had propos to make thi clear to them at dinner with allus to her late father ’ s governorship , and also at the same time to hint that it wa exceedingli stupid of them to turn away on meet her . the fat colonel-major ( he wa realli a discharg offic of low rank ) wa also absent , but it appear that he had been “ not himself ” for the last two day . the parti consist of the pole , a wretch look clerk with a spotti face and a greasi coat , who had not a word to say for himself , and smelt abomin , a deaf and almost blind old man who had onc been in the post offic and who had been from immemori age maintain by someon at amalia ivanovna ’ s . a retir clerk of the commissariat depart came , too ; he wa drunk , had a loud and most unseemli laugh and onli fanci -- wa without a waistcoat ! one of the visitor sat straight down to the tabl without even greet katerina ivanovna . final one person have no suit appear in hi dressing-gown , but thi wa too much , and the effort of amalia ivanovna and the pole succeed in remov him . the pole brought with him , howev , two other pole who did not live at amalia ivanovna ’ s and whom no one had seen here befor . all thi irrit katerina ivanovna intens . “ for whom had they made all these prepar then ? ” to make room for the visitor the children had not even been laid for at the tabl ; but the two littl one were sit on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box , while polenka as a big girl had to look after them , feed them , and keep their nose wipe like well-br children ’ s . katerina ivanovna , in fact , could hardli help meet her guest with increas digniti , and even haughti . she stare at some of them with special sever , and loftili invit them to take their seat . rush to the conclus that amalia ivanovna must be respons for those who were absent , she began treat her with extrem nonchal , which the latter promptli observ and resent . such a begin wa no good omen for the end . all were seat at last . raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemeteri . katerina ivanovna wa greatli delight to see him , in the first place , becaus he wa the one “ educ visitor , and , as everyon knew , wa in two year to take a professorship in the univers , ” and secondli becaus he immedi and respect apologis for have been unabl to be at the funer . she posit pounc upon him , and made him sit on her left hand ( amalia ivanovna wa on her right ) . in spite of her continu anxieti that the dish should be pass round correctli and that everyon should tast them , in spite of the agonis cough which interrupt her everi minut and seem to have grown wors dure the last few day , she hasten to pour out in a half whisper to raskolnikov all her suppress feel and her just indign at the failur of the dinner , interspers her remark with live and uncontrol laughter at the expens of her visitor and especi of her landladi . “ it ’ s all that cuckoo ’ s fault ! you know whom i mean ? her , her ! ” katerina ivanovna nod toward the landladi . “ look at her , she ’ s make round eye , she feel that we are talk about her and can ’ t understand . pfoo , the owl ! ha-ha ! ( cough-cough-cough . ) and what doe she put on that cap for ? ( cough-cough-cough . ) have you notic that she want everyon to consid that she is patronis me and do me an honour by be here ? i ask her like a sensibl woman to invit peopl , especi those who knew my late husband , and look at the set of fool she ha brought ! the sweep ! look at that one with the spotti face . and those wretch pole , ha-ha-ha ! ( cough-cough-cough . ) not one of them ha ever poke hi nose in here , i ’ ve never set eye on them . what have they come here for , i ask you ? there they sit in a row . hey , _pan_ ! ” she cri suddenli to one of them , “ have you tast the pancak ? take some more ! have some beer ! won ’ t you have some vodka ? look , he ’ s jump up and is make hi bow , they must be quit starv , poor thing . never mind , let them eat ! they don ’ t make a nois , anyway , though i ’ m realli afraid for our landladi ’ s silver spoon ... amalia ivanovna ! ” she address her suddenli , almost aloud , “ if your spoon should happen to be stolen , i won ’ t be respons , i warn you ! ha-ha-ha ! ” she laugh turn to raskolnikov , and again nod toward the landladi , in high glee at her salli . “ she didn ’ t understand , she didn ’ t understand again ! look how she sit with her mouth open ! an owl , a real owl ! an owl in new ribbon , ha-ha-ha ! ” here her laugh turn again to an insuffer fit of cough that last five minut . drop of perspir stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief wa stain with blood . she show raskolnikov the blood in silenc , and as soon as she could get her breath began whisper to him again with extrem anim and a hectic flush on her cheek . “ do you know , i gave her the most delic instruct , so to speak , for invit that ladi and her daughter , you understand of whom i am speak ? it need the utmost delicaci , the greatest niceti , but she ha manag thing so that that fool , that conceit baggag , that provinci nonent , simpli becaus she is the widow of a major , and ha come to tri and get a pension and to fray out her skirt in the govern offic , becaus at fifti she paint her face ( everybodi know it ) ... a creatur like that did not think fit to come , and ha not even answer the invit , which the most ordinari good manner requir ! i can ’ t understand whi pyotr petrovitch ha not come ? but where ’ s sonia ? where ha she gone ? ah , there she is at last ! what is it , sonia , where have you been ? it ’ s odd that even at your father ’ s funer you should be so unpunctu . rodion romanovitch , make room for her besid you . that ’ s your place , sonia ... take what you like . have some of the cold entré with jelli , that ’ s the best . they ’ ll bring the pancak directli . have they given the children some ? polenka , have you got everyth ? ( cough-cough-cough . ) that ’ s all right . be a good girl , lida , and , kolya , don ’ t fidget with your feet ; sit like a littl gentleman . what are you say , sonia ? ” sonia hasten to give her pyotr petrovitch ’ s apolog , tri to speak loud enough for everyon to hear and care choos the most respect phrase which she attribut to pyotr petrovitch . she ad that pyotr petrovitch had particularli told her to say that , as soon as he possibl could , he would come immedi to discuss _business_ alon with her and to consid what could be done for her , etc. , etc . sonia knew that thi would comfort katerina ivanovna , would flatter her and gratifi her pride . she sat down besid raskolnikov ; she made him a hurri bow , glanc curious at him . but for the rest of the time she seem to avoid look at him or speak to him . she seem absent-mind , though she kept look at katerina ivanovna , tri to pleas her . neither she nor katerina ivanovna had been abl to get mourn ; sonia wa wear dark brown , and katerina ivanovna had on her onli dress , a dark stripe cotton one . the messag from pyotr petrovitch wa veri success . listen to sonia with digniti , katerina ivanovna inquir with equal digniti how pyotr petrovitch wa , then at onc whisper almost aloud to raskolnikov that it certainli would have been strang for a man of pyotr petrovitch ’ s posit and stand to find himself in such “ extraordinari compani , ” in spite of hi devot to her famili and hi old friendship with her father . “ that ’ s whi i am so grate to you , rodion romanovitch , that you have not disdain my hospit , even in such surround , ” she ad almost aloud . “ but i am sure that it wa onli your special affect for my poor husband that ha made you keep your promise. ” then onc more with pride and digniti she scan her visitor , and suddenli inquir aloud across the tabl of the deaf man : “ wouldn ’ t he have some more meat , and had he been given some wine ? ” the old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he wa ask , though hi neighbour amus themselv by poke and shake him . he simpli gaze about him with hi mouth open , which onli increas the gener mirth . “ what an imbecil ! look , look ! whi wa he brought ? but as to pyotr petrovitch , i alway had confid in him , ” katerina ivanovna continu , “ and , of cours , he is not like ... ” with an extrem stern face she address amalia ivanovna so sharpli and loudli that the latter wa quit disconcert , “ not like your dress up draggletail whom my father would not have taken as cook into hi kitchen , and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invit them in the good of hi heart. ” “ ye , he wa fond of drink , he wa fond of it , he did drink ! ” cri the commissariat clerk , gulp down hi twelfth glass of vodka . “ my late husband certainli had that weak , and everyon know it , ” katerina ivanovna attack him at onc , “ but he wa a kind and honour man , who love and respect hi famili . the worst of it wa hi good natur made him trust all sort of disreput peopl , and he drank with fellow who were not worth the sole of hi shoe . would you believ it , rodion romanovitch , they found a gingerbread cock in hi pocket ; he wa dead drunk , but he did not forget the children ! ” “ a cock ? did you say a cock ? ” shout the commissariat clerk . katerina ivanovna did not vouchsaf a repli . she sigh , lost in thought . “ no doubt you think , like everyon , that i wa too sever with him , ” she went on , address raskolnikov . “ but that ’ s not so ! he respect me , he respect me veri much ! he wa a kind-heart man ! and how sorri i wa for him sometim ! he would sit in a corner and look at me , i use to feel so sorri for him , i use to want to be kind to him and then would think to myself : ‘ be kind to him and he will drink again , ’ it wa onli by sever that you could keep him within bounds. ” “ ye , he use to get hi hair pull pretti often , ” roar the commissariat clerk again , swallow anoth glass of vodka . “ some fool would be the better for a good drub , as well as have their hair pull . i am not talk of my late husband now ! ” katerina ivanovna snap at him . the flush on her cheek grew more and more mark , her chest heav . in anoth minut she would have been readi to make a scene . mani of the visitor were snigger , evid delight . they began poke the commissariat clerk and whisper someth to him . they were evid tri to egg him on . “ allow me to ask what are you allud to , ” began the clerk , “ that is to say , whose ... about whom ... did you say just now ... but i don ’ t care ! that ’ s nonsens ! widow ! i forgiv you .... pass ! ” and he took anoth drink of vodka . raskolnikov sat in silenc , listen with disgust . he onli ate from polit , just tast the food that katerina ivanovna wa continu put on hi plate , to avoid hurt her feel . he watch sonia intent . but sonia becam more and more anxiou and distress ; she , too , foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceabl , and saw with terror katerina ivanovna ’ s grow irrit . she knew that she , sonia , wa the chief reason for the ‘ genteel ’ ladi ’ contemptu treatment of katerina ivanovna ’ s invit . she had heard from amalia ivanovna that the mother wa posit offend at the invit and had ask the question : “ how could she let her daughter sit down besid _that young person_ ? ” sonia had a feel that katerina ivanovna had alreadi heard thi and an insult to sonia meant more to katerina ivanovna than an insult to herself , her children , or her father , sonia knew that katerina ivanovna would not be satisfi now , “ till she had shown those draggletail that they were both ... ” to make matter wors someon pass sonia , from the other end of the tabl , a plate with two heart pierc with an arrow , cut out of black bread . katerina ivanovna flush crimson and at onc said aloud across the tabl that the man who sent it wa “ a drunken ass ! ” amalia ivanovna wa forese someth amiss , and at the same time deepli wound by katerina ivanovna ’ s haughti , and to restor the good-humour of the compani and rais herself in their esteem she began , apropo of noth , tell a stori about an acquaint of her “ karl from the chemist ’ s , ” who wa drive one night in a cab , and that “ the cabman want him to kill , and karl veri much beg him not to kill , and wept and clasp hand , and frighten and from fear pierc hi heart. ” though katerina ivanovna smile , she observ at onc that amalia ivanovna ought not to tell anecdot in russian ; the latter wa still more offend , and she retort that her “ _vater au berlin_ wa a veri import man , and alway went with hi hand in pockets. ” katerina ivanovna could not restrain herself and laugh so much that amalia ivanovna lost patienc and could scarc control herself . “ listen to the owl ! ” katerina ivanovna whisper at onc , her good-humour almost restor , “ she meant to say he kept hi hand in hi pocket , but she said he put hi hand in peopl ’ s pocket . ( cough-cough . ) and have you notic , rodion romanovitch , that all these petersburg foreign , the german especi , are all stupid than we ! can you fanci anyon of us tell how ‘ karl from the chemist ’ s ’ ‘ pierc hi heart from fear ’ and that the idiot , instead of punish the cabman , ‘ clasp hi hand and wept , and much begged. ’ ah , the fool ! and you know she fanci it ’ s veri touch and doe not suspect how stupid she is ! to my think that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal clever , anyway one can see that he ha addl hi brain with drink , but you know , these foreign are alway so well behav and seriou .... look how she sit glare ! she is angri , ha-ha ! ( cough-cough-cough . ) ” regain her good-humour , katerina ivanovna began at onc tell raskolnikov that when she had obtain her pension , she intend to open a school for the daughter of gentlemen in her nativ town t -- -- . thi wa the first time she had spoken to him of the project , and she launch out into the most allur detail . it suddenli appear that katerina ivanovna had in her hand the veri certif of honour of which marmeladov had spoken to raskolnikov in the tavern , when he told him that katerina ivanovna , hi wife , had danc the shawl danc befor the governor and other great personag on leav school . thi certif of honour wa obvious intend now to prove katerina ivanovna ’ s right to open a boarding-school ; but she had arm herself with it chiefli with the object of overwhelm “ those two stuck-up draggletail ” if they came to the dinner , and prove incontest that katerina ivanovna wa of the most nobl , “ she might even say aristocrat famili , a colonel ’ s daughter and wa far superior to certain adventuress who have been so much to the fore of late. ” the certif of honour immedi pass into the hand of the drunken guest , and katerina ivanovna did not tri to retain it , for it actual contain the statement _en tout lettres_ , that her father wa of the rank of a major , and also a companion of an order , so that she realli wa almost the daughter of a colonel . warm up , katerina ivanovna proceed to enlarg on the peac and happi life they would lead in t -- -- , on the gymnasium teacher whom she would engag to give lesson in her boarding-school , one a most respect old frenchman , one mangot , who had taught katerina ivanovna herself in old day and wa still live in t -- -- , and would no doubt teach in her school on moder term . next she spoke of sonia who would go with her to t -- -- and help her in all her plan . at thi someon at the further end of the tabl gave a sudden guffaw . though katerina ivanovna tri to appear to be disdain unawar of it , she rais her voic and began at onc speak with convict of sonia ’ s undoubt abil to assist her , of “ her gentl , patienc , devot , generos and good educ , ” tap sonia on the cheek and kiss her warmli twice . sonia flush crimson , and katerina ivanovna suddenli burst into tear , immedi observ that she wa “ nervou and silli , that she wa too much upset , that it wa time to finish , and as the dinner wa over , it wa time to hand round the tea. ” at that moment , amalia ivanovna , deepli aggriev at take no part in the convers , and not be listen to , made one last effort , and with secret misgiv ventur on an exceedingli deep and weighti observ , that “ in the futur boarding-school she would have to pay particular attent to _die wäsche_ , and that there certainli must be a good _dame_ to look after the linen , and secondli that the young ladi must not novel at night read. ” katerina ivanovna , who certainli wa upset and veri tire , as well as heartili sick of the dinner , at onc cut short amalia ivanovna , say “ she knew noth about it and wa talk nonsens , that it wa the busi of the laundri maid , and not of the directress of a high-class boarding-school to look after _die wäsche_ , and as for novel-read , that wa simpli rude , and she beg her to be silent. ” amalia ivanovna fire up and get angri observ that she onli “ meant her good , ” and that “ she had meant her veri good , ” and that “ it wa long sinc she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings. ” katerina ivanovna at onc “ set her down , ” say that it wa a lie to say she wish her good , becaus onli yesterday when her dead husband wa lie on the tabl , she had worri her about the lodg . to thi amalia ivanovna veri appropri observ that she had invit those ladi , but “ those ladi had not come , becaus those ladi _are_ ladi and can not come to a ladi who is not a lady. ” katerina ivanovna at onc point out to her , that as she wa a slut she could not judg what made one realli a ladi . amalia ivanovna at onc declar that her “ _vater au berlin_ wa a veri , veri import man , and both hand in pocket went , and alway use to say : ‘ poof ! poof ! ’ ” and she leapt up from the tabl to repres her father , stick her hand in her pocket , puf her cheek , and utter vagu sound resembl “ poof ! poof ! ” amid loud laughter from all the lodger , who purpos encourag amalia ivanovna , hope for a fight . but thi wa too much for katerina ivanovna , and she at onc declar , so that all could hear , that amalia ivanovna probabl never had a father , but wa simpli a drunken petersburg finn , and had certainli onc been a cook and probabl someth wors . amalia ivanovna turn as red as a lobster and squeal that perhap katerina ivanovna never had a father , “ but she had a _vater au berlin_ and that he wore a long coat and alway said poof-poof-poof ! ” katerina ivanovna observ contemptu that all knew what her famili wa and that on that veri certif of honour it wa state in print that her father wa a colonel , while amalia ivanovna ’ s father -- if she realli had one -- wa probabl some finnish milkman , but that probabl she never had a father at all , sinc it wa still uncertain whether her name wa amalia ivanovna or amalia ludwigovna . at thi amalia ivanovna , lash to furi , struck the tabl with her fist , and shriek that she wa amalia ivanovna , and not ludwigovna , “ that her _vater_ wa name johann and that he wa a burgomeist , and that katerina ivanovna ’ s _vater_ wa quit never a burgomeister. ” katerina ivanovna rose from her chair , and with a stern and appar calm voic ( though she wa pale and her chest wa heav ) observ that “ if she dare for one moment to set her contempt wretch of a father on a level with her papa , she , katerina ivanovna , would tear her cap off her head and trampl it under foot. ” amalia ivanovna ran about the room , shout at the top of her voic , that she wa mistress of the hous and that katerina ivanovna should leav the lodg that minut ; then she rush for some reason to collect the silver spoon from the tabl . there wa a great outcri and uproar , the children began cri . sonia ran to restrain katerina ivanovna , but when amalia ivanovna shout someth about “ the yellow ticket , ” katerina ivanovna push sonia away , and rush at the landladi to carri out her threat . at that minut the door open , and pyotr petrovitch luzhin appear on the threshold . he stood scan the parti with sever and vigil eye . katerina ivanovna rush to him . chapter iii “ pyotr petrovitch , ” she cri , “ protect me ... you at least ! make thi foolish woman understand that she can ’

orphans. ” “ allow me , madam .... allow me. ” pyotr petrovitch wave her off . “ your papa as you are well awar i had not the honour of know ” ( someon laugh aloud ) “ and i do not intend to take part in your everlast squabbl with amalia ivanovna .... i have come here to speak of my own affair ... and i want to have a word with your stepdaught , sofya ... ivanovna , i think it is ? allow me to pass. ” pyotr petrovitch , edg by her , went to the opposit corner where sonia wa . katerina ivanovna remain stand where she wa , as though thunderstruck . she could not understand how pyotr petrovitch could deni have enjoy her father ’ s hospit . though she had invent it herself , she believ in it firmli by thi time . she wa struck too by the businesslik , dri and even contemptu menac tone of pyotr petrovitch . all the clamour gradual die away at hi entranc . not onli wa thi “ seriou busi man ” strikingli incongru with the rest of the parti , but it wa evid , too , that he had come upon some matter of consequ , that some except caus must have brought him and that therefor someth wa go to happen . raskolnikov , stand besid sonia , move asid to let him pass ; pyotr petrovitch did not seem to notic him . a minut later lebeziatnikov , too , appear in the doorway ; he did not come in , but stood still , listen with mark interest , almost wonder , and seem for a time perplex . “ excus me for possibl interrupt you , but it ’ s a matter of some import , ” pyotr petrovitch observ , address the compani gener . “ i am glad inde to find other person present . amalia ivanovna , i

out and describ a parabola in the air fell at luzhin ’ s feet . everyon saw it , sever cri out . pyotr petrovitch stoop down , pick up the paper in two finger , lift it where all could see it and open it . it wa a hundred-roubl note fold in eight . pyotr petrovitch held up the note show it to everyon . “ thief ! out of my lodg . polic , polic ! ” yell amalia ivanovna . “ they must to siberia be sent ! away ! ” exclam aros on all side . raskolnikov wa silent , keep hi eye fix on sonia , except for an occasion rapid glanc at luzhin . sonia stood still , as though unconsci . she wa hardli abl to feel surpris . suddenli the colour rush to her cheek ; she utter a cri and hid her face in her hand . “ no , it wasn ’ t i ! i didn ’ t take it ! i know noth about it , ” she cri with a heartrend wail , and she ran to katerina ivanovna , who clasp her tightli in her arm , as though she would shelter her from all the world . “ sonia ! sonia ! i don ’ t believ it ! you see , i don ’ t believ it ! ” she cri in the face of the obviou fact , sway her to and fro in her arm like a babi , kiss her face continu , then snatch at her hand and kiss them , too , “ you took it ! how stupid these peopl

do you see ? what a memori dinner for you ! merci heaven ! defend her , whi are you all stand still ? rodion romanovitch , whi don ’ t you stand up for her ? do you believ it , too ? you are not worth her littl finger , all of you togeth ! good god ! defend her now , at least ! ” the wail of the poor , consumpt , helpless woman seem to produc a great effect on her audienc . the agonis , wast , consumpt face , the parch blood-stain lip , the hoars voic , the tear unrestrain as a child ’ s , the trust , childish and yet despair prayer for help were so piteou that everyon seem to feel for her . pyotr petrovitch at ani rate wa at onc move to _compassion_ . “ madam , madam , thi incid doe not reflect upon you ! ” he cri impress , “ no one would take upon himself to accus you of be an instig or even an accomplic in it , especi as you have prove her guilt by turn out her pocket , show that you had no previou idea of it . i am most readi , most readi to show compass , if poverti , so to speak , drove sofya semyonovna to it , but whi did you refus to confess , mademoisel ? were you afraid of the disgrac ? the first step ? you lost your head , perhap ? one can quit understand it .... but how could you have lower yourself to such an action ? gentlemen , ” he address the whole compani , “ gentlemen ! compassion and , so to say , commiser these peopl , i am readi to overlook it even now in spite of the person insult lavish upon me ! and may thi disgrac be a lesson to you for the futur , ” he said , address sonia , “ and i will carri the matter no further . enough ! ” pyotr petrovitch stole a glanc at raskolnikov . their eye met , and the fire in raskolnikov ’ s seem readi to reduc him to ash . meanwhil katerina ivanovna appar heard noth . she wa kiss and hug sonia like a madwoman . the children , too , were embrac sonia on all side , and polenka -- though she did not fulli understand what wa wrong -- wa drown in tear and shake with sob , as she hid her pretti littl face , swollen with weep , on sonia ’ s shoulder . “ how vile ! ” a loud voic cri suddenli in the doorway . pyotr petrovitch look round quickli . “ what vile ! ” lebeziatnikov repeat , stare him straight in the face . pyotr petrovitch gave a posit start -- all notic it and recal it afterward . lebeziatnikov strode into the room . “ and you dare to call me as wit ? ” he said , go up to pyotr petrovitch . “ what do you mean ? what are you talk about ? ” mutter luzhin . “ i mean that you ... are a slander , that ’ s what my word mean ! ” lebeziatnikov said hotli , look sternli at him with hi short-sight eye . he wa extrem angri . raskolnikov gaze intent at him , as though seiz and weigh each word . again there wa a silenc . pyotr petrovitch inde seem almost dumbfound for the first moment . “ if you mean that for me , ... ” he began , stammer . “ but what ’ s the matter with you ? are you out of your mind ? ” “ i ’ m in my mind , but you are a scoundrel ! ah , how vile ! i have heard everyth . i kept wait on purpos to understand it , for i must own even now it is not quit logic .... what you have done it all for i can ’ t understand. ” “ whi , what have i done then ? give over talk in your nonsens riddl ! or mayb you are drunk ! ” “ you may be a drunkard , perhap , vile man , but i am not ! i never touch vodka , for it ’ s against my convict . would you believ it , he , he himself , with hi own hand gave sofya semyonovna that hundred-roubl note -- i saw it , i wa a wit , i ’ ll take my oath ! he did it , he ! ” repeat lebeziatnikov , address all . “ are you crazi , milksop ? ” squeal luzhin . “ she is herself befor you -- she herself here declar just now befor everyon that i gave her onli ten roubl . how could i have given it to her ? ” “ i saw it , i saw it , ” lebeziatnikov repeat , “ and though it is against my principl , i am readi thi veri minut to take ani oath you like befor the court , for i saw how you slip it in her pocket . onli like a fool i thought you did it out of kind ! when you were say good-by to her at the door , while you held her hand in one hand , with the other , the left , you slip the note into her pocket . i saw it , i saw it ! ” luzhin turn pale . “ what lie ! ” he cri impud , “ whi , how could you , stand by the window , see the note ? you fanci it with your short-sight eye . you are rave ! ” “ no , i didn ’ t fanci it . and though i wa stand some way off , i saw it all . and though it certainli would be hard to distinguish a note from the window -- that ’ s true -- i knew for certain that it wa a hundred-roubl note , becaus , when you were go to give sofya semyonovna ten roubl , you took up from the tabl a hundred-roubl note ( i saw it becaus i wa stand near then , and an idea struck me at onc , so that i did not forget you had it in your hand ) . you fold it and kept it in your hand all the time . i didn ’ t think of it again until , when you were get up , you chang it from your right hand to your left and nearli drop it ! i notic it becaus the same idea struck me again , that you meant to do her a kind without my see . you can fanci how i watch you and i saw how you succeed in slip it into her pocket . i saw it , i saw it , i ’ ll take my oath. ” lebeziatnikov wa almost breathless . exclam aros on all hand chiefli express of wonder , but some were menac in tone . they all crowd round pyotr petrovitch . katerina ivanovna flew to lebeziatnikov . “ i wa mistaken in you ! protect her ! you are the onli one to take her part ! she is an orphan . god ha sent you ! ” katerina ivanovna , hardli know what she wa do , sank on her knee befor him . “ a pack of nonsens ! ” yell luzhin , rous to furi , “ it ’ s all nonsens you ’ ve been talk ! ‘ an idea struck you , you didn ’ t think , you notic ’ -- what doe it amount to ? so i gave it to her on the sli on purpos ? what for ? with what object ? what have i to do with thi ... ? ” “ what for ? that ’ s what i can ’ t understand , but that what i am tell you is the fact , that ’ s certain ! so far from my be mistaken , you infam crimin man , i rememb how , on account of it , a question occur to me at onc , just when i wa thank you and press your hand . what made you put it secretli in her pocket ? whi you did it secretli , i mean ? could it be simpli to conceal it from me , know that my convict are oppos to your and that i do not approv of privat benevol , which effect no radic cure ? well , i decid that you realli were asham of give such a larg sum befor me . perhap , too , i thought , he want to give her a surpris , when she find a whole hundred-roubl note in her pocket . ( for i know , some benevol peopl are veri fond of deck out their charit action in that way . ) then the idea struck me , too , that you want to test her , to see whether , when she found it , she would come to thank you . then , too , that you want to avoid thank and that , as the say is , your right hand should not know ... someth of that sort , in fact . i thought of so mani possibl that i put off consid it , but still thought it indel to show you that i knew your secret . but anoth idea struck me again that sofya semyonovna might easili lose the money befor she notic it , that wa whi i decid to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundr roubl in her pocket . but on my way i went first to madam kobilatnikov ’ s to take them the ‘ gener treatis on the posit method ’ and especi to recommend piderit ’ s articl ( and also wagner ’ s ) ; then i come on here and what a state of thing i find ! now could i , could i , have all these idea and reflect if i had not seen you put the hundred-roubl note in her pocket ? ” when lebeziatnikov finish hi long-wind harangu with the logic deduct at the end , he wa quit tire , and the perspir stream from hi face . he could not , ala , even express himself correctli in russian , though he knew no other languag , so that he wa quit exhaust , almost emaci after thi heroic exploit . but hi speech produc a power effect . he had spoken with such vehem , with such convict that everyon obvious believ him . pyotr petrovitch felt that thing were go badli with him . “ what is it to do with me if silli idea did occur to you ? ” he shout , “ that ’ s no evid . you may have dreamt it , that ’ s all ! and i tell you , you are lie , sir . you are lie and slander from some spite against me , simpli from piqu , becaus i did not agre with your free-think , godless , social proposit ! ” but thi retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch . murmur of disapprov were heard on all side . “ ah , that ’ s your line now , is it ! ” cri lebeziatnikov , “ that ’ s nonsens ! call the polic and i ’ ll take my oath ! there ’ s onli one thing i can ’ t understand : what made him risk such a contempt action . oh , piti , despic man ! ” “ i can explain whi he risk such an action , and if necessari , i , too , will swear to it , ” raskolnikov said at last in a firm voic , and he step forward . he appear to be firm and compos . everyon felt clearli , from the veri look of him that he realli knew about it and that the mysteri would be solv . “ now i can explain it all to myself , ” said raskolnikov , address lebeziatnikov . “ from the veri begin of the busi , i suspect that there wa some scoundrelli intrigu at the bottom of it . i began to suspect it from some special circumst known to me onli , which i will explain at onc to everyon : they account for everyth . your valuabl evid ha final made everyth clear to me . i beg all , all to listen . thi gentleman ( he point to luzhin ) wa recent engag to be marri to a young ladi -- my sister , avdotya romanovna raskolnikov . but come to petersburg he quarrel with me , the day befor yesterday , at our first meet and i drove him out of my room -- i have two wit to prove it . he is a veri spite man .... the day befor yesterday i did not know that he wa stay here , in your room , and that consequ on the veri day we quarrel -- the day befor yesterday -- he saw me give katerina ivanovna some money for the funer , as a friend of the late mr. marmeladov . he at onc wrote a note to my mother and inform her that i had given away all my money , not to katerina ivanovna but to sofya semyonovna , and refer in a most contempt way to the ... charact of sofya semyonovna , that is , hint at the charact of my attitud to sofya semyonovna . all thi you understand wa with the object of divid me from my mother and sister , by insinu that i wa squander on unworthi object the money which they had sent me and which wa all they had . yesterday even , befor my mother and sister and in hi presenc , i declar that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funer and not to sofya semyonovna and that i had no acquaint with sofya semyonovna and had never seen her befor , inde . at the same time i ad that he , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , with all hi virtu , wa not worth sofya semyonovna ’ s littl finger , though he spoke so ill of her . to hi question -- would i let sofya semyonovna sit down besid my sister , i answer that i had alreadi done so that day . irrit that my mother and sister were unwil to quarrel with me at hi insinu , he gradual began be unpardon rude to them . a final ruptur took place and he wa turn out of the hous . all thi happen yesterday even . now i beg your special attent : consid : if he had now succeed in prove that sofya semyonovna wa a thief , he would have shown to my mother and sister that he wa almost right in hi suspicion , that he had reason to be angri at my put my sister on a level with sofya semyonovna , that , in attack me , he wa protect and preserv the honour of my sister , hi betroth . in fact he might even , through all thi , have been abl to estrang me from my famili , and no doubt he hope to be restor to favour with them ; to say noth of reveng himself on me person , for he ha ground for suppos that the honour and happi of sofya semyonovna are veri preciou to me . that wa what he wa work for ! that ’ s how i understand it . that ’ s the whole reason for it and there can be no other ! ” it wa like thi , or somewhat like thi , that raskolnikov wound up hi speech which wa follow veri attent , though often interrupt by exclam from hi audienc . but in spite of interrupt he spoke clearli , calmli , exactli , firmli . hi decis voic , hi tone of convict and hi stern face made a great impress on everyon . “ ye , ye , that ’ s it , ” lebeziatnikov assent gleefulli , “ that must be it , for he ask me , as soon as sofya semyonovna came into our room , whether you were here , whether i had seen you among katerina ivanovna ’ s guest . he call me asid to the window and ask me in secret . it wa essenti for him that you should be here ! that ’ s it , that ’ s it ! ” luzhin smile contemptu and did not speak . but he wa veri pale . he seem to be deliber on some mean of escap . perhap he would have been glad to give up everyth and get away , but at the moment thi wa scarc possibl . it would have impli admit the truth of the accus brought against him . moreov , the compani , which had alreadi been excit by drink , wa now too much stir to allow it . the commissariat clerk , though inde he had not grasp the whole posit , wa shout louder than anyon and wa make some suggest veri unpleas to luzhin . but not all those present were drunk ; lodger came in from all the room . the three pole were tremend excit and were continu shout at him : “ the _pan_ is a _lajdak_ ! ” and mutter threat in polish . sonia had been listen with strain attent , though she too seem unabl to grasp it all ; she seem as though she had just return to conscious . she did not take her eye off raskolnikov , feel that all her safeti lay in him . katerina ivanovna breath hard and pain and seem fear exhaust . amalia ivanovna stood look more stupid than anyon , with her mouth wide open , unabl to make out what had happen . she onli saw that pyotr petrovitch had somehow come to grief . raskolnikov wa attempt to speak again , but they did not let him . everyon wa crowd round luzhin with threat and shout of abus . but pyotr petrovitch wa not intimid . see that hi accus of sonia had complet fail , he had recours to insol : “ allow me , gentlemen , allow me ! don ’ t squeez , let me pass ! ” he said , make hi way through the crowd . “ and no threat , if you pleas ! i assur you it will be useless , you will gain noth by it . on the contrari , you ’ ll have to answer , gentlemen , for violent obstruct the cours of justic . the thief ha been more than unmask , and i shall prosecut . our judg are not so blind and ... not so drunk , and will not believ the testimoni of two notori infidel , agit , and atheist , who accus me from motiv of person reveng which they are foolish enough to admit .... ye , allow me to pass ! ” “ don ’ t let me find a trace of you in my room ! kindli leav at onc , and everyth is at an end between us ! when i think of the troubl i ’ ve been take , the way i ’ ve been expound ... all thi fortnight ! ” “ i told you myself to-day that i wa go , when you tri to keep me ; now i will simpli add that you are a fool . i advis you to see a doctor for your brain and your short sight . let me pass , gentlemen ! ” he forc hi way through . but the commissariat clerk wa unwil to let him off so easili : he pick up a glass from the tabl , brandish it in the air and flung it at pyotr petrovitch ; but the glass flew straight at amalia ivanovna . she scream , and the clerk , overbalanc , fell heavili under the tabl . pyotr petrovitch made hi way to hi room and half an hour later had left the hous . sonia , timid by natur , had felt befor that day that she could be ill-treat more easili than anyon , and that she could be wrong with impun . yet till that moment she had fanci that she might escap misfortun by care , gentl and submiss befor everyon . her disappoint wa too great . she could , of cours , bear with patienc and almost without murmur anyth , even thi . but for the first minut she felt it too bitter . in spite of her triumph and her justif -- when her first terror and stupefact had pass and she could understand it all clearli -- the feel of her helpless and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she wa overcom with hyster weep . at last , unabl to bear ani more , she rush out of the room and ran home , almost immedi after luzhin ’ s departur . when amidst loud laughter the glass flew at amalia ivanovna , it wa more than the landladi could endur . with a shriek she rush like a furi at katerina ivanovna , consid her to blame for everyth . “ out of my lodg ! at onc ! quick march ! ” and with these word she began snatch up everyth she could lay her hand on that belong to katerina ivanovna , and throw it on the floor . katerina ivanovna , pale , almost faint , and gasp for breath , jump up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaust and dart at amalia ivanovna . but the battl wa too unequ : the landladi wave her away like a feather . “ what ! as though that godless calumni wa not enough -- thi vile creatur attack me ! what ! on the day of my husband ’ s funer i am turn out of my lodg ! after eat my bread and salt she turn me into the street , with my orphan ! where am i to go ? ” wail the poor woman , sob and gasp . “ good god ! ” she cri with flash eye , “ is there no justic upon earth ? whom should you protect if not us orphan ? we shall see ! there is law and justic on earth , there is , i will find it ! wait a bit , godless creatur ! polenka , stay with the children , i ’ ll come back . wait for me , if you have to wait in the street . we will see whether there is justic on earth ! ” and throw over her head that green shawl which marmeladov had mention to raskolnikov , katerina ivanovna squeez her way through the disorderli and drunken crowd of lodger who still fill the room , and , wail and tear , she ran into the street -- with a vagu intent of go at onc somewher to find justic . polenka with the two littl one in her arm crouch , terrifi , on the trunk in the corner of the room , where she wait trembl for her mother to come back . amalia ivanovna rage about the room , shriek , lament and throw everyth she came across on the floor . the lodger talk incoher , some comment to the best of their abil on what had happen , other quarrel and swore at one anoth , while other struck up a song .... “ now it ’ s time for me to go , ” thought raskolnikov . “ well , sofya semyonovna , we shall see what you ’ ll say now ! ” and he set off in the direct of sonia ’ s lodg . chapter iv raskolnikov had been a vigor and activ champion of sonia against luzhin , although he had such a load of horror and anguish in hi own heart . but have gone through so much in the morn , he found a sort of relief in a chang of sensat , apart from the strong person feel which impel him to defend sonia . he wa agit too , especi at some moment , by the thought of hi approach interview with sonia : he _had_ to tell her who had kill lizaveta . he knew the terribl suffer it would be to him and , as it were , brush away the thought of it . so when he cri as he left katerina ivanovna ’ s , “ well , sofya semyonovna , we shall see what you ’ ll say now ! ” he wa still superfici excit , still vigor and defiant from hi triumph over luzhin . but , strang to say , by the time he reach sonia ’ s lodg , he felt a sudden impot and fear . he stood still in hesit at the door , ask himself the strang question : “ must he tell her who kill lizaveta ? ” it wa a strang question becaus he felt at the veri time not onli that he could not help tell her , but also that he could not put off the tell . he did not yet know whi it must be so , he onli _felt_ it , and the agonis sens of hi impot befor the inevit almost crush him . to cut short hi hesit and suffer , he quickli open the door and look at sonia from the doorway . she wa sit with her elbow on the tabl and her face in her hand , but see raskolnikov she got up at onc and came to meet him as though she were expect him . “ what would have becom of me but for you ? ” she said quickli , meet him in the middl of the room . evid she wa in hast to say thi to him . it wa what she had been wait for . raskolnikov went to the tabl and sat down on the chair from which she had onli just risen . she stood face him , two step away , just as she had done the day befor . “ well , sonia ? ” he said , and felt that hi voic wa trembl , “ it wa all due to ‘ your social posit and the habit associ with it. ’ did you understand that just now ? ” her face show her distress . “ onli don ’ t talk to me as you did yesterday , ” she interrupt him . “ pleas don ’ t begin it . there is miseri enough without that. ” she made hast to smile , afraid that he might not like the reproach . “ i wa silli to come away from there . what is happen there now ? i want to go back directli , but i kept think that ... you would come. ” he told her that amalia ivanovna wa turn them out of their lodg and that katerina ivanovna had run off somewher “ to seek justice. ” “ my god !

” “ but i can ’ t know the divin provid .... and whi do you ask what can ’ t be answer ? what ’ s the use of such foolish question ? how could it happen that it should depend on my decis -- who ha made me a judg to decid who is to live and who is not to live ? ” “ oh , if the divin provid is to be mix up in it , there is no do anyth , ” raskolnikov grumbl moros . “ you ’ d better say straight out what you want !

” she mutter in distress , look intent at him . “ it ’ s all nonsens .... listen , sonia. ” he suddenli smile , a pale helpless smile for two second . “ you rememb what i meant to tell you yesterday ? ” sonia wait uneasili . “ i said as i went away that perhap i wa say good-by for ever , but that if i came to-day i would tell you who ... who kill lizaveta. ” she began trembl all over . “ well , here i ’ ve come to tell you. ” “ then you realli meant it yesterday ? ” she whisper with difficulti . “ how do you know ? ” she ask quickli , as though suddenli regain her reason . sonia ’ s face grew paler and paler , and she breath pain . “ i know. ” she paus a minut . “ have they found him ? ” she ask timidli . “ no. ” “ then how do you know about _it_ ? ” she ask again , hardli audibl and again after a minut ’ s paus . he turn to her and look veri intent at her . “ guess , ” he said , with the same distort helpless smile . a shudder pass over her . “ but you ... whi do you frighten me like thi ? ” she said , smile like a child . “ i must be a great friend of _his_ ... sinc i know , ” raskolnikov went on , still gaze into her face , as though he could not turn hi eye away . “ he ... did not mean to kill that lizaveta ... he ... kill her accident .... he meant to kill the old woman when she wa alon and he went there ... and then lizaveta came in ... he kill her too. ” anoth aw moment pass . both still gaze at one anoth . “ you can ’ t guess , then ? ” he ask suddenli , feel as though he were fling himself down from a steepl . “ n-no ... ” whisper sonia . “ take a good look. ” as soon as he had said thi again , the same familiar sensat froze hi heart . he look at her and all at onc seem to see in her face the face of lizaveta . he rememb clearli the express in lizaveta ’ s face , when he approach her with the axe and she step back to the wall , put out her hand , with childish terror in her face , look as littl children do when they begin to be frighten of someth , look intent and uneasili at what frighten them , shrink back and hold out their littl hand on the point of cri . almost the same thing happen now to sonia . with the same helpless and the same terror , she look at him for a while and , suddenli put out her left hand , press her finger faintli against hi breast and slowli began to get up from the bed , move further from him and keep her eye fix even more immov on him . her terror infect him . the same fear show itself on hi face . in the same way he stare at her and almost with the same _childish_ smile . “ have you guess ? ” he whisper at last . “ good god ! ” broke in an aw wail from her bosom . she sank helplessli on the bed with her face in the pillow , but a moment later she got up , move quickli to him , seiz both hi hand and , grip them tight in her thin finger , began look into hi face again with the same intent stare . in thi last desper look she tri to look into him and catch some last hope . but there wa no hope ; there wa no doubt remain ; it wa all true ! later on , inde , when she recal that moment , she thought it strang and wonder whi she had seen at onc that there wa no doubt . she could not have said , for instanc , that she had foreseen someth of the sort -- and yet now , as soon as he told her , she suddenli fanci that she had realli foreseen thi veri thing . “ stop , sonia , enough ! don ’ t tortur me , ” he beg her miser . it wa not at all , not at all like thi he had thought of tell her , but thi is how it happen . she jump up , seem not to know what she wa do , and , wring her hand , walk into the middl of the room ; but quickli went back and sat down again besid him , her shoulder almost touch hi . all of a sudden she start as though she had been stab , utter a cri and fell on her knee befor him , she did not know whi . “ what have you done -- what have you done to yourself ? ” she said in despair , and , jump up , she flung herself on hi neck , threw her arm round him , and held him tightli . raskolnikov drew back and look at her with a mourn smile . “ you are a strang girl , sonia -- you kiss me and hug me when i tell you about that .... you don ’ t think what you are doing. ” “ there is no one -- no one in the whole world now so unhappi as you ! ” she cri in a frenzi , not hear what he said , and she suddenli broke into violent hyster weep . a feel long unfamiliar to him flood hi heart and soften it at onc . he did not struggl against it . two tear start into hi eye and hung on hi eyelash . “ then you won ’ t leav me , sonia ? ” he said , look at her almost with hope . “ no , no , never , nowher ! ” cri sonia . “ i will follow you , i will follow you everywher . oh , my god ! oh , how miser i am ! ... whi , whi didn ’ t i know you befor ! whi didn ’ t you come befor ? oh , dear ! ” “ here i have come. ” “ ye , now !

could it be true ? ” “ what ’ s the mean of it ? where am i ? ” she said in complet bewilder , as though still unabl to recov herself . “ how could you , you , a man like you .... how could you bring yourself to it ? ... what doe it mean ? ” “ oh , well -- to plunder . leav off , sonia , ” he answer wearili , almost with vexat . sonia stood as though struck dumb , but suddenli she cri : “ you were hungri ! it wa ... to help your mother ? ye ? ” “ no , sonia , no , ” he mutter , turn away and hang hi head . “ i wa not so hungri .... i certainli did want to help my mother , but ... that ’ s not the real thing either .... don ’ t tortur me , sonia. ” sonia clasp her hand . “ could it , could it all be true ? good god , what a truth ! who could believ it ? and how could you give away your last farth and yet rob and murder ! ah , ” she cri suddenli , “ that money you gave katerina ivanovna ... that money .... can that money ... ” “ no , sonia , ” he broke in hurriedli , “ that money wa not it . don ’ t worri yourself ! that money my mother sent me and it came when i wa ill , the day i gave it to you .... razumihin saw it ... he receiv it for me .... that money wa mine -- my own. ” sonia listen to him in bewilder and did her utmost to comprehend . “ and _that_ money .... i don ’ t even know realli whether there wa ani money , ” he ad softli , as though reflect . “ i took a purs off her neck , made of chamoi leather ... a purs stuf full of someth ... but i didn ’ t look in it ; i suppos i hadn ’ t time .... and the thing -- chain and trinket -- i buri under a stone with the purs next morn in a yard off the v -- -- prospect . they are all there now .... ” sonia strain everi nerv to listen . “ then whi ... whi , you said you did it to rob , but you took noth ? ” she ask quickli , catch at a straw . “ i don ’ t know .... i haven ’ t yet decid whether to take that money or not , ” he said , muse again ; and , seem to wake up with a start , he gave a brief iron smile . “ ach , what silli stuff i am talk , eh ? ” the thought flash through sonia ’ s mind , wasn ’ t he mad ? but she dismiss it at onc . “ no , it wa someth else. ” she could make noth of it , noth . “ do you know , sonia , ” he said suddenli with convict , “ let me tell you : if i ’ d simpli kill becaus i wa hungri , ” lay stress on everi word and look enigmat but sincer at her , “ i should be _happy_ now . you must believ that ! what would it matter to you , ” he cri a moment later with a sort of despair , “ what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong ? what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me ? ah , sonia , wa it for that i ’ ve come to you to-day ? ” again sonia tri to say someth , but did not speak . “ i ask you to go with me yesterday becaus you are all i have left. ” “ go where ? ” ask sonia timidli . “ not to steal and not to murder , don ’ t be anxiou , ” he smile bitterli . “ we are so differ .... and you know , sonia , it ’ s onli now , onli thi moment that i understand _where_ i ask you to go with me yesterday ! yesterday when i said it i did not know where . i ask you for one thing , i came to you for one thing -- not to leav me . you won ’ t leav me , sonia ? ” she squeez hi hand . “ and whi , whi did i tell her ? whi did i let her know ? ” he cri a minut later in despair , look with infinit anguish at her . “ here you expect an explan from me , sonia ; you are sit and wait for it , i see that . but what can i tell you ? you won ’ t understand and will onli suffer miseri ... on my account ! well , you are cri and embrac me again . whi do you do it ? becaus i couldn ’ t bear my burden and have come to throw it on anoth : you suffer too , and i shall feel better ! and can you love such a mean wretch ? ” “ but aren ’ t you suffer , too ? ” cri sonia . again a wave of the same feel surg into hi heart , and again for an instant soften it . “ sonia , i have a bad heart , take note of that . it may explain a great deal . i have come becaus i am bad . there are men who wouldn ’ t have come . but i am a coward and ... a mean wretch . but ... never mind ! that ’ s not the point . i must speak now , but i don ’ t know how to begin. ” he paus and sank into thought . “ ach , we are so differ , ” he cri again , “ we are not alik . and whi , whi did i come ? i shall never forgiv myself that. ” “ no , no , it wa a good thing you came , ” cri sonia . “ it ’ s better i should know , far better ! ” he look at her with anguish . “ what if it were realli that ? ” he said , as though reach a conclus . “ ye , that ’ s what it wa ! i want to becom a napoleon , that is whi i kill her .... do you understand now ? ” “ n-no , ” sonia whisper naïv and timidli . “ onli speak , speak , i shall understand , i shall understand _in myself_ ! ” she kept beg him . “ you ’ ll understand ? veri well , we shall see ! ” he paus and wa for some time lost in medit . “ it wa like thi : i ask myself one day thi question -- what if napoleon , for instanc , had happen to be in my place , and if he had not had toulon nor egypt nor the passag of mont blanc to begin hi career with , but instead of all those picturesqu and monument thing , there had simpli been some ridicul old hag , a pawnbrok , who had to be murder too to get money from her trunk ( for hi career , you understand ) . well , would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other mean ? wouldn ’ t he have felt a pang at it be so far from monument and ... and sin , too ? well , i must tell you that i worri myself fear over that ‘ question ’ so that i wa aw asham when i guess at last ( all of a sudden , somehow ) that it would not have given him the least pang , that it would not even have struck him that it wa not monument ... that he would not have seen that there wa anyth in it to paus over , and that , if he had had no other way , he would have strangl her in a minut without think about it ! well , i too ... left off think about it ... murder her , follow hi exampl . and that ’ s exactli how it wa ! do you think it funni ? ye , sonia , the funniest thing of all is that perhap that ’ s just how it was. ” sonia did not think it at all funni . “ you had better tell me straight out ... without exampl , ” she beg , still more timidli and scarc audibl . he turn to her , look sadli at her and took her hand . “ you are right again , sonia . of cours that ’ s all nonsens , it ’ s almost all talk ! you see , you know of cours that my mother ha scarc anyth , my sister happen to have a good educ and wa condemn to drudg as a gover . all their hope were center on me . i wa a student , but i couldn ’ t keep myself at the univers and wa forc for a time to leav it . even if i had linger on like that , in ten or twelv year i might ( with luck ) hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salari of a thousand roubl ” ( he repeat it as though it were a lesson ) “ and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxieti and i could not succeed in keep her in comfort while my sister ... well , my sister might well have fare wors ! and it ’ s a hard thing to pass everyth by all one ’ s life , to turn one ’ s back upon everyth , to forget one ’ s mother and decor accept the insult inflict on one ’ s sister . whi should one ? when one ha buri them to burden oneself with other -- wife and children -- and to leav them again without a farth ? so i resolv to gain possess of the old woman ’ s money and to use it for my first year without worri my mother , to keep myself at the univers and for a littl while after leav it -- and to do thi all on a broad , thorough scale , so as to build up a complet new career and enter upon a new life of independ .... well ... that ’ s all .... well , of cours in kill the old woman i did wrong .... well , that ’ s enough. ” he struggl to the end of hi speech in exhaust and let hi head sink . “ oh , that ’ s not it , that ’ s not it , ” sonia cri in distress . “ how could one ... no , that ’ s not right , not right. ” “ you see yourself that it ’ s not right . but i ’ ve spoken truli , it ’ s the truth. ” “ as though that could be the truth ! good god ! ” “ i ’ ve onli kill a lous , sonia , a useless , loathsom , harm creature. ” “ a human be -- a lous ! ” “ i too know it wasn ’ t a lous , ” he answer , look strang at her . “ but i am talk nonsens , sonia , ” he ad . “ i ’ ve been talk nonsens a long time .... that ’ s not it , you are right there . there were quit , quit other caus for it !

good god ! ” and she wrung her hand in despair . “ no , sonia , that ’ s not it , ” he began again suddenli , rais hi head , as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were rous him -- “ that ’ s not it !

it lay there by the pillow ; raskolnikov saw it . he walk away to the window . lebeziatnikov skip up to him . “ she is dead , ” he said . “ rodion romanovitch , i must have two word with you , ” said svidrigaïlov , come up to them . lebeziatnikov at onc made room for him and delic withdrew . svidrigaïlov drew raskolnikov further away . “ i will undertak all the arrang , the funer and that . you know it ’ s a question of money and , as i told you , i have plenti to spare . i will put those two littl one and polenka into some good orphan asylum , and i will settl fifteen hundr roubl to be paid to each on come of age , so that sofya semyonovna need have no anxieti about them . and i will pull her out of the mud too , for she is a good girl , isn ’ t she ? so tell avdotya romanovna that that is how i am spend her ten thousand. ” “ what is your motiv for such benevol ? ” ask raskolnikov . “ ah ! you sceptic person ! ” laugh svidrigaïlov . “ i told you i had no need of that money . won ’ t you admit that it ’ s simpli done from human ? she wasn ’ t ‘ a lous , ’ you know ” ( he point to the corner where the dead woman lay ) , “ wa she , like some old pawnbrok woman ? come , you ’ ll agre , is luzhin to go on live , and do wick thing or is she to die ? and if i didn ’ t help them , polenka would go the same way. ” he said thi with an air of a sort of gay wink slyness , keep hi eye fix on raskolnikov , who turn white and cold , hear hi own phrase , spoken to sonia . he quickli step back and look wildli at svidrigaïlov . “ how do you know ? ” he whisper , hardli abl to breath . “ whi , i lodg here at madam resslich ’ s , the other side of the wall . here is kapernaumov , and there live madam resslich , an old and devot friend of mine . i am a neighbour. ” “ you ? ” “ ye , ” continu svidrigaïlov , shake with laughter . “ i assur you on my honour , dear rodion romanovitch , that you have interest me enorm . i told you we should becom friend , i foretold it . well , here we have . and you will see what an accommod person i am . you ’ ll see that you can get on with me ! ” part vi chapter i a strang period began for raskolnikov : it wa as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrap him in a dreari solitud from which there wa no escap . recal that period long after , he believ that hi mind had been cloud at time , and that it had continu so , with interv , till the final catastroph . he wa convinc that he had been mistaken about mani thing at that time , for instanc as to the date of certain event . anyway , when he tri later on to piec hi recollect togeth , he learnt a great deal about himself from what other peopl told him . he had mix up incid and had explain event as due to circumst which exist onli in hi imagin . at time he wa a prey to agoni of morbid uneasi , amount sometim to panic . but he rememb , too , moment , hour , perhap whole day , of complet apathi , which came upon him as a reaction from hi previou terror and might be compar with the abnorm insens , sometim seen in the die . he seem to be tri in that latter stage to escap from a full and clear understand of hi posit . certain essenti fact which requir immedi consider were particularli irksom to him . how glad he would have been to be free from some care , the neglect of which would have threaten him with complet , inevit ruin . he wa particularli worri about svidrigaïlov , he might be said to be perman think of svidrigaïlov . from the time of svidrigaïlov ’ s too menac and unmistak word in sonia ’ s room at the moment of katerina ivanovna ’ s death , the normal work of hi mind seem to break down . but although thi new fact caus him extrem uneasi , raskolnikov wa in no hurri for an explan of it . at time , find himself in a solitari and remot part of the town , in some wretch eating-hous , sit alon lost in thought , hardli know how he had come there , he suddenli thought of svidrigaïlov . he recognis suddenli , clearli , and with dismay that he ought at onc to come to an understand with that man and to make what term he could . walk outsid the citi gate one day , he posit fanci that they had fix a meet there , that he wa wait for svidrigaïlov . anoth time he woke up befor daybreak lie on the ground under some bush and could not at first understand how he had come there . but dure the two or three day after katerina ivanovna ’ s death , he had two or three time met svidrigaïlov at sonia ’ s lodg , where he had gone aimlessli for a moment . they exchang a few word and made no refer to the vital subject , as though they were tacitli agre not to speak of it for a time . katerina ivanovna ’ s bodi wa still lie in the coffin , svidrigaïlov wa busi make arrang for the funer . sonia too wa veri busi . at their last meet svidrigaïlov inform raskolnikov that he had made an arrang , and a veri satisfactori one , for katerina ivanovna ’ s children ; that he had , through certain connect , succeed in get hold of certain personag by whose help the three orphan could be at onc place in veri suitabl institut ; that the money he had settl on them had been of great assist , as it is much easier to place orphan with some properti than destitut one . he said someth too about sonia and promis to come himself in a day or two to see raskolnikov , mention that “ he would like to consult with him , that there were thing they must talk over .... ” thi convers took place in the passag on the stair . svidrigaïlov look intent at raskolnikov and suddenli , after a brief paus , drop hi voic , ask : “ but how is it , rodion romanovitch ; you don ’ t seem yourself ? you look and you listen , but you don ’ t seem to understand . cheer up ! we ’ ll talk thing over ; i am onli sorri , i ’ ve so much to do of my own busi and other peopl ’ s . ah , rodion romanovitch , ” he ad suddenli , “ what all men need is fresh air , fresh air ... more than anyth ! ” he move to one side to make way for the priest and server , who were come up the stair . they had come for the requiem servic . by svidrigaïlov ’ s order it wa sung twice a day punctual . svidrigaïlov went hi way . raskolnikov stood still a moment , thought , and follow the priest into sonia ’ s room . he stood at the door . they began quietli , slowli and mourn sing the servic . from hi childhood the thought of death and the presenc of death had someth oppress and mysteri aw ; and it wa long sinc he had heard the requiem servic . and there wa someth els here as well , too aw and disturb . he look at the children : they were all kneel by the coffin ; polenka wa weep . behind them sonia pray , softli and , as it were , timidli weep . “ these last two day she hasn ’ t said a word to me , she hasn ’ t glanc at me , ” raskolnikov thought suddenli . the sunlight wa bright in the room ; the incens rose in cloud ; the priest read , “ give rest , oh lord .... ” raskolnikov stay all through the servic . as he bless them and took hi leav , the priest look round strang . after the servic , raskolnikov went up to sonia . she took both hi hand and let her head sink on hi shoulder . thi slight friendli gestur bewild raskolnikov . it seem strang to him that there wa no trace of repugn , no trace of disgust , no tremor in her hand . it wa the furthest limit of self-abneg , at least so he interpret it . sonia said noth . raskolnikov press her hand and went out . he felt veri miser . if it had been possibl to escap to some solitud , he would have thought himself lucki , even if he had to spend hi whole life there . but although he had almost alway been by himself of late , he had never been abl to feel alon . sometim he walk out of the town on to the high road , onc he had even reach a littl wood , but the loneli the place wa , the more he seem to be awar of an uneasi presenc near him . it did not frighten him , but greatli annoy him , so that he made hast to return to the town , to mingl with the crowd , to enter restaur and tavern , to walk in busi thoroughfar . there he felt easier and even more solitari . one day at dusk he sat for an hour listen to song in a tavern and he rememb that he posit enjoy it . but at last he had suddenli felt the same uneasi again , as though hi conscienc smote him . “ here i sit listen to sing , is that what i ought to be do ? ” he thought . yet he felt at onc that that wa not the onli caus of hi uneasi ; there wa someth requir immedi decis , but it wa someth he could not clearli understand or put into word . it wa a hopeless tangl . “ no , better the struggl again ! better porfiri again ... or svidrigaïlov .... better some challeng again ... some attack . ye , ye ! ” he thought . he went out of the tavern and rush away almost at a run . the thought of dounia and hi mother suddenli reduc him almost to a panic . that night he woke up befor morn among some bush in krestovski island , trembl all over with fever ; he walk home , and it wa earli morn when he arriv . after some hour ’ sleep the fever left him , but he woke up late , two o ’ clock in the afternoon . he rememb that katerina ivanovna ’ s funer had been fix for that day , and wa glad that he wa not present at it . nastasya brought him some food ; he ate and drank with appetit , almost with greedi . hi head wa fresher and he wa calmer than he had been for the last three day . he even felt a pass wonder at hi previou attack of panic . the door open and razumihin came in . “ ah , he ’ s eat , then he ’ s not ill , ” said razumihin . he took a chair and sat down at the tabl opposit raskolnikov . he wa troubl and did not attempt to conceal it . he spoke with evid annoy , but without hurri or rais hi voic . he look as though he had some special fix determin . “ listen , ” he began resolut . “ as far as i am concern , you may all go to hell , but from what i see , it ’ s clear to me that i can ’ t make head or tail of it ; pleas don ’ t think i ’ ve come to ask you question . i don ’ t want to know , hang it ! if you begin tell me your secret , i dare say i shouldn ’ t stay to listen , i should go away curs . i have onli come to find out onc for all whether it ’ s a fact that you are mad ? there is a convict in the air that you are mad or veri nearli so . i admit i ’ ve been dispos to that opinion myself , judg from your stupid , repuls and quit inexplic action , and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister . onli a monster or a madman could treat them as you have ; so you must be mad. ” “ when did you see them last ? ” “ just now . haven ’ t you seen them sinc then ? what have you been do with yourself ? tell me , pleas . i ’ ve been to you three time alreadi . your mother ha been serious ill sinc yesterday . she had made up her mind to come to you ; avdotya romanovna tri to prevent her ; she wouldn ’ t hear a word . ‘ if he is ill , if hi mind is give way , who can look after him like hi mother ? ’ she said . we all came here togeth , we couldn ’ t let her come alon all the way . we kept beg her to be calm . we came in , you weren ’ t here ; she sat down , and stay ten minut , while we stood wait in silenc . she got up and said : ‘ if he ’ s gone out , that is , if he is well , and ha forgotten hi mother , it ’ s humili and unseemli for hi mother to stand at hi door beg for kindness. ’ she return home and took to her bed ; now she is in a fever . ‘ i see , ’ she said , ‘ that he ha time for _hi girl_. ’ she mean by _your girl_ sofya semyonovna , your betroth or your mistress , i don ’ t know . i went at onc to sofya semyonovna ’ s , for i want to know what wa go on . i look round , i saw the coffin , the children cri , and sofya semyonovna tri them on mourn dress . no sign of you . i apologis , came away , and report to avdotya romanovna . so that ’ s all nonsens and you haven ’ t got a girl ; the most like thing is that you are mad . but here you sit , guzzl boil beef as though you ’ d not had a bite for three day . though as far as that goe , madmen eat too , but though you have not said a word to me yet ... you are not mad ! that i ’ d swear ! abov all , you are not mad ! so you may go to hell , all of you , for there ’ s some mysteri , some secret about it , and i don ’ t intend to worri my brain over your secret . so i ’ ve simpli come to swear at you , ” he finish , get up , “ to reliev my mind . and i know what to do now. ” “ what do you mean to do now ? ” “ what busi is it of your what i mean to do ? ” “ you are go in for a drink bout. ” “ how ... how did you know ? ” “ whi , it ’ s pretti plain. ” razumihin paus for a minut . “ you alway have been a veri ration person and you ’ ve never been mad , never , ” he observ suddenli with warmth . “ you ’ re right : i shall drink . good-by ! ” and he move to go out . “ i wa talk with my sister -- the day befor yesterday , i think it wa -- about you , razumihin. ” “ about me ! but ... where can you have seen her the day befor yesterday ? ” razumihin stop short and even turn a littl pale . one could see that hi heart wa throb slowli and violent . “ she came here by herself , sat there and talk to me. ” “ she did ! ” “ yes. ” “ what did you say to her ... i mean , about me ?

” “ she got a letter to-day . it upset her veri much -- veri much inde . too much so . i began speak of you , she beg me not to . then ... then she said that perhap we should veri soon have to part ... then she began warmli thank me for someth ; then she went to her room and lock herself in. ” “ she got a letter ? ” raskolnikov ask thought . “ ye , and you didn ’ t know ? hm ... ” they were both silent . “ good-by , rodion . there wa a time , brother , when i .... never mind , good-by . you see , there wa a time .... well , good-by ! i must be off too . i am not go to drink . there ’ s no need now .... that ’ s all stuff ! ” he hurri out ; but when he had almost close the door behind him , he suddenli open it again , and said , look away : “ oh , by the way , do you rememb that murder , you know porfiri ’ s , that old woman ? do you know the murder ha been found , he ha confess and given the proof . it ’ s one of those veri workmen , the painter , onli fanci ! do you rememb i defend them here ? would you believ it , all that scene of fight and laugh with hi companion on the stair while the porter and the two wit were go up , he got up on purpos to disarm suspicion . the cun , the presenc of mind of the young dog ! one can hardli credit it ; but it ’ s hi own explan , he ha confess it all . and what a fool i wa about it ! well , he ’ s simpli a geniu of hypocrisi and resourc in disarm the suspicion of the lawyer -- so there ’ s noth much to wonder at , i suppos ! of cours peopl like that are alway possibl . and the fact that he couldn ’ t keep up the charact , but confess , make him easier to believ in . but what a fool i wa ! i wa frantic on their side ! ” “ tell me , pleas , from whom did you hear that , and whi doe it interest you so ? ” raskolnikov ask with unmistak agit . “ what next ? you ask me whi it interest me ! ... well , i heard it from porfiri , among other ... it wa from him i heard almost all about it. ” “ from porfiri ? ” “ from porfiry. ” “ what ... what did he say ? ” raskolnikov ask in dismay . “ he gave me a capit explan of it . psycholog , after hi fashion. ” “ he explain it ? explain it himself ? ” “ ye , ye ; good-by . i ’ ll tell you all about it anoth time , but now i ’ m busi . there wa a time when i fanci ... but no matter , anoth time ! ... what need is there for me to drink now ? you have made me drunk without wine . i am drunk , rodya ! good-by , i ’ m go . i ’ ll come again veri soon. ” he went out . “ he ’ s a polit conspir , there ’ s not a doubt about it , ” razumihin decid , as he slowli descend the stair . “ and he ’ s drawn hi sister in ; that ’ s quit , quit in keep with avdotya romanovna ’ s charact . there are interview between them ! ... she hint at it too ... so mani of her word .... and hint ... bear that mean ! and how els can all thi tangl be explain ? hm ! and i wa almost think ... good heaven , what i thought ! ye , i took leav of my sens and i wrong him ! it wa hi do , under the lamp in the corridor that day . pfoo ! what a crude , nasti , vile idea on my part ! nikolay is a brick , for confess .... and how clear it all is now ! hi ill then , all hi strang action ... befor thi , in the univers , how moros he use to be , how gloomi .... but what ’ s the mean now of that letter ? there ’ s someth in that , too , perhap . whom wa it from ? i suspect ... ! no , i must find out ! ” he thought of dounia , realis all he had heard and hi heart throb , and he suddenli broke into a run . as soon as razumihin went out , raskolnikov got up , turn to the window , walk into one corner and then into anoth , as though forget the small of hi room , and sat down again on the sofa . he felt , so to speak , renew ; again the struggl , so a mean of escap had come . “ ye , a mean of escap had come ! it had been too stifl , too cramp , the burden had been too agonis . a lethargi had come upon him at time . from the moment of the scene with nikolay at porfiri ’ s he had been suffoc , pen in without hope of escap . after nikolay ’ s confess , on that veri day had come the scene with sonia ; hi behaviour and hi last word had been utterli unlik anyth he could have imagin beforehand ; he had grown feebler , instantli and fundament ! and he had agre at the time with sonia , he had agre in hi heart he could not go on live alon with such a thing on hi mind ! “ and svidrigaïlov wa a riddl ... he worri him , that wa true , but somehow not on the same point . he might still have a struggl to come with svidrigaïlov . svidrigaïlov , too , might be a mean of escap ; but porfiri wa a differ matter . “ and so porfiri himself had explain it to razumihin , had explain it _psychologically_ . he had begun bring in hi damn psycholog again ! porfiri ? but to think that porfiri should for one moment believ that nikolay wa guilti , after what had pass between them befor nikolay ’ s appear , after that tête-à-têt interview , which could have onli _one_ explan ? ( dure those day raskolnikov had often recal passag in that scene with porfiri ; he could not bear to let hi mind rest on it . ) such word , such gestur had pass between them , they had exchang such glanc , thing had been said in such a tone and had reach such a pass , that nikolay , whom porfiri had seen through at the first word , at the first gestur , could not have shaken hi convict . “ and to think that even razumihin had begun to suspect ! the scene in the corridor under the lamp had produc it effect then . he had rush to porfiri .... but what had induc the latter to receiv him like that ? what had been hi object in put razumihin off with nikolay ? he must have some plan ; there wa some design , but what wa it ? it wa true that a long time had pass sinc that morn -- too long a time -- and no sight nor sound of porfiri . well , that wa a bad sign .... ” raskolnikov took hi cap and went out of the room , still ponder . it wa the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in hi mind , at least . “ i must settl svidrigaïlov , ” he thought , “ and as soon as possibl ; he , too , seem to be wait for me to come to him of my own accord. ” and at that moment there wa such a rush of hate in hi weari heart that he might have kill either of those two -- porfiri or svidrigaïlov . at least he felt that he would be capabl of do it later , if not now . “ we shall see , we shall see , ” he repeat to himself . but no sooner had he open the door than he stumbl upon porfiri himself in the passag . he wa come in to see him . raskolnikov wa dumbfound for a minut , but onli for one minut . strang to say , he wa not veri much astonish at see porfiri and scarc afraid of him . he wa simpli startl , but wa quickli , instantli , on hi guard . “ perhap thi will mean the end ? but how could porfiri have approach so quietli , like a cat , so that he had heard noth ? could he have been listen at the door ? ” “ you didn ’ t expect a visitor , rodion romanovitch , ” porfiri explain , laugh . “ i ’ ve been mean to look in a long time ; i wa pass by and thought whi not go in for five minut . are you go out ? i won ’ t keep you long . just let me have one cigarette. ” “ sit down , porfiri petrovitch , sit down. ” raskolnikov gave hi visitor a seat with so pleas and friendli an express that he would have marvel at himself , if he could have seen it . the last moment had come , the last drop had to be drain ! so a man will sometim go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand , yet when the knife is at hi throat at last , he feel no fear . raskolnikov seat himself directli face porfiri , and look at him without flinch . porfiri screw up hi eye and began light a cigarett . “ speak , speak , ” seem as though it would burst from raskolnikov ’ s heart . “ come , whi don ’ t you speak ? ” chapter ii “ ah these cigarett ! ” porfiri petrovitch ejacul at last , have light one . “ they are pernici , posit pernici , and yet i can ’ t give them up ! i cough , i begin to have tickl in my throat and a difficulti in breath . you know i am a coward , i went late to dr. b -- -- n ; he alway give at least half an hour to each patient . he posit laugh look at me ; he sound me : ‘ tobacco ’ s bad for you , ’ he said , ‘ your lung are affected. ’ but how am i to give it up ? what is there to take it place ? i don ’ t drink , that ’ s the mischief , he-he-h , that i don ’ t . everyth is rel , rodion romanovitch , everyth is rel ! ” “ whi , he ’ s play hi profession trick again , ” raskolnikov thought with disgust . all the circumst of their last interview suddenli came back to him , and he felt a rush of the feel that had come upon him then . “ i came to see you the day befor yesterday , in the even ; you didn ’ t know ? ” porfiri petrovitch went on , look round the room . “ i came into thi veri room . i wa pass by , just as i did to-day , and i thought i ’ d return your call . i walk in as your door wa wide open , i look round , wait and went out without leav my name with your servant . don ’ t you lock your door ? ” raskolnikov ’ s face grew more and more gloomi . porfiri seem to guess hi state of mind . “ i ’ ve come to have it out with you , rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow ! i owe you an explan and must give it to you , ” he continu with a slight smile , just pat raskolnikov ’ s knee . but almost at the same instant a seriou and careworn look came into hi face ; to hi surpris raskolnikov saw a touch of sad in it . he had never seen and never suspect such an express in hi face . “ a strang scene pass between us last time we met , rodion romanovitch . our first interview , too , wa a strang one ; but then ... and one thing after anoth ! thi is the point : i have perhap act unfairli to you ; i feel it . do you rememb how we part ? your nerv were unhing and your knee were shake and so were mine . and , you know , our behaviour wa unseemli , even ungentlemanli . and yet we are gentlemen , abov all , in ani case , gentlemen ; that must be understood . do you rememb what we came to ? ... and it wa quit indecorous. ” “ what is he up to , what doe he take me for ? ” raskolnikov ask himself in amaz , rais hi head and look with open eye on porfiri . “ i ’ ve decid open is better between us , ” porfiri petrovitch went on , turn hi head away and drop hi eye , as though unwil to disconcert hi former victim and as though disdain hi former wile . “ ye , such suspicion and such scene can not continu for long . nikolay put a stop to it , or i don ’ t know what we might not have come to . that damn workman wa sit at the time in the next room -- can you realis that ? you know that , of cours ; and i am awar that he came to you afterward . but what you suppos then wa not true : i had not sent for anyon , i had made no kind of arrang . you ask whi i hadn ’ t ? what shall i say to you ? it had all come upon me so suddenli . i had scarc sent for the porter ( you notic them as you went out , i dare say ) . an idea flash upon me ; i wa firmli convinc at the time , you see , rodion romanovitch . come , i thought -- even if i let one thing slip for a time , i shall get hold of someth els -- i shan ’ t lose what i want , anyway . you are nervous irrit , rodion romanovitch , by tempera ; it ’ s out of proport with other qualiti of your heart and charact , which i flatter myself i have to some extent divin . of cours i did reflect even then that it doe not alway happen that a man get up and blurt out hi whole stori . it doe happen sometim , if you make a man lose all patienc , though even then it ’ s rare . i wa capabl of realis that . if i onli had a fact , i thought , the least littl fact to go upon , someth i could lay hold of , someth tangibl , not mere psycholog . for if a man is guilti , you must be abl to get someth substanti out of him ; one may reckon upon most surpris result inde . i wa reckon on your tempera , rodion romanovitch , on your tempera abov all thing ! i had great hope of you at that time. ” “ but what are you drive at now ? ” raskolnikov mutter at last , ask the question without think . “ what is he talk about ? ” he wonder distractedli , “ doe he realli take me to be innoc ? ” “ what am i drive at ? i ’ ve come to explain myself , i consid it my duti , so to speak . i want to make clear to you how the whole busi , the whole misunderstand aros . i ’ ve caus you a great deal of suffer , rodion romanovitch . i am not a monster . i understand what it must mean for a man who ha been unfortun , but who is proud , imperi and abov all , impati , to have to bear such treatment ! i regard you in ani case as a man of nobl charact and not without element of magnanim , though i don ’ t agre with all your convict . i want to tell you thi first , frankli and quit sincer , for abov all i don ’ t want to deceiv you . when i made your acquaint , i felt attract by you . perhap you will laugh at my say so . you have a right to . i know you dislik me from the first and inde you ’ ve no reason to like me . you may think what you like , but i desir now to do all i can to effac that impress and to show that i am a man of heart and conscienc . i speak sincerely. ” porfiri petrovitch made a dignifi paus . raskolnikov felt a rush of renew alarm . the thought that porfiri believ him to be innoc began to make him uneasi . “ it ’ s scarc necessari to go over everyth in detail , ” porfiri petrovitch went on . “ inde , i could scarc attempt it . to begin with there were rumour . through whom , how , and when those rumour came to me ... and how they affect you , i need not go into . my suspicion were arous by a complet accid , which might just as easili not have happen . what wa it ? hm ! i believ there is no need to go into that either . those rumour and that accid led to one idea in my mind . i admit it openli -- for one may as well make a clean breast of it -- i wa the first to pitch on you . the old woman ’ s note on the pledg and the rest of it -- that all came to noth . your wa one of a hundr . i happen , too , to hear of the scene at the offic , from a man who describ it capit , unconsci reproduc the scene with great vivid . it wa just one thing after anoth , rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow ! how could i avoid be brought to certain idea ? from a hundr rabbit you can ’ t make a hors , a hundr suspicion don ’ t make a proof , as the english proverb say , but that ’ s onli from the ration point of view -- you can ’ t help be partial , for after all a lawyer is onli human . i thought , too , of your articl in that journal , do you rememb , on your first visit we talk of it ? i jeer at you at the time , but that wa onli to lead you on . i repeat , rodion romanovitch , you are ill and impati . that you were bold , headstrong , in earnest and ... had felt a great deal i recognis long befor . i , too , have felt the same , so that your articl seem familiar to me . it wa conceiv on sleepless night , with a throb heart , in ecstasi and suppress enthusiasm . and that proud suppress enthusiasm in young peopl is danger ! i jeer at you then , but let me tell you that , as a literari amateur , i am aw fond of such first essay , full of the heat of youth . there is a misti and a chord vibrat in the mist . your articl is absurd and fantast , but there ’ s a transpar sincer , a youth incorrupt pride and the dare of despair in it . it ’ s a gloomi articl , but that ’ s what ’ s fine in it . i read your articl and put it asid , think as i did so ‘ that man won ’ t go the common way. ’ well , i ask you , after that as a preliminari , how could i help be carri away by what follow ? oh , dear , i am not say anyth , i am not make ani statement now . i simpli note it at the time . what is there in it ? i reflect . there ’ s noth in it , that is realli noth and perhap absolut noth . and it ’ s not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carri away by notion : here i have nikolay on my hand with actual evid against him -- you may think what you like of it , but it ’ s evid . he bring in hi psycholog , too ; one ha to consid him , too , for it ’ s a matter of life and death . whi am i explain thi to you ? that you may understand , and not blame my malici behaviour on that occas . it wa not malici , i assur you , he-h ! do you suppos i didn ’ t come to search your room at the time ? i did , i did , he-h ! i wa here when you were lie ill in bed , not offici , not in my own person , but i wa here . your room wa search to the last thread at the first suspicion ; but _umsonst_ ! i thought to myself , now that man will come , will come of himself and quickli , too ; if he ’ s guilti , he ’ s sure to come . anoth man wouldn ’ t , but he will . and you rememb how mr. razumihin began discuss the subject with you ? we arrang that to excit you , so we purpos spread rumour , that he might discuss the case with you , and razumihin is not a man to restrain hi indign . mr. zametov wa tremend struck by your anger and your open dare . think of blurt out in a restaur ‘ i kill her. ’ it wa too dare , too reckless . i thought so myself , if he is guilti he will be a formid oppon . that wa what i thought at the time . i wa expect you . but you simpli bowl zametov over and ... well , you see , it all lie in thi -- that thi damnabl psycholog can be taken two way ! well , i kept expect you , and so it wa , you came ! my heart wa fairli throb . ach ! “ now , whi need you have come ? your laughter , too , as you came in , do you rememb ? i saw it all plain as daylight , but if i hadn ’ t expect you so special , i should not have notic anyth in your laughter . you see what influenc a mood ha ! mr. razumihin then -- ah , that stone , that stone under which the thing were hidden ! i seem to see it somewher in a kitchen garden . it wa in a kitchen garden , you told zametov and afterward you repeat that in my offic ? and when we began pick your articl to piec , how you explain it ! one could take everi word of your in two sens , as though there were anoth mean hidden . “ so in thi way , rodion romanovitch , i reach the furthest limit , and knock my head against a post , i pull myself up , ask myself what i wa about . after all , i said , you can take it all in anoth sens if you like , and it ’ s more natur so , inde . i couldn ’ t help admit it wa more natur . i wa bother ! ‘ no , i ’ d better get hold of some littl fact ’ i said . so when i heard of the bell-ring , i held my breath and wa all in a tremor . ‘ here is my littl fact , ’ thought i , and i didn ’ t think it over , i simpli wouldn ’ t . i would have given a thousand roubl at that minut to have seen you with my own eye , when you walk a hundr pace besid that workman , after he had call you murder to your face , and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way . and then what about your trembl , what about your bell-ring in your ill , in semi-delirium ? “ and so , rodion romanovitch , can you wonder that i play such prank on you ? and what made you come at that veri minut ? someon seem to have sent you , by jove ! and if nikolay had not part us ... and do you rememb nikolay at the time ? do you rememb him clearli ? it wa a thunderbolt , a regular thunderbolt ! and how i met him ! i didn ’ t believ in the thunderbolt , not for a minut . you could see it for yourself ; and how could i ? even afterward , when you had gone and he began make veri , veri plausibl answer on certain point , so that i wa surpris at him myself , even then i didn ’ t believ hi stori ! you see what it is to be as firm as a rock ! no , thought i , _morgenfrüh_ . what ha nikolay got to do with it ! ” “ razumihin told me just now that you think nikolay guilti and had yourself assur him of it .... ” hi voic fail him , and he broke off . he had been listen in indescrib agit , as thi man who had seen through and through him , went back upon himself . he wa afraid of believ it and did not believ it . in those still ambigu word he kept eagerli look for someth more definit and conclus . “ mr . razumihin ! ” cri porfiri petrovitch , seem glad of a question from raskolnikov , who had till then been silent . “ he-he-h ! but i had to put mr. razumihin off ; two is compani , three is none . mr. razumihin is not the right man , besid he is an outsid . he came run to me with a pale face .... but never mind him , whi bring him in ? to return to nikolay , would you like to know what sort of a type he is , how i understand him , that is ? to begin with , he is still a child and not exactli a coward , but someth by way of an artist . realli , don ’ t laugh at my describ him so . he is innoc and respons to influenc . he ha a heart , and is a fantast fellow . he sing and danc , he tell stori , they say , so that peopl come from other villag to hear him . he attend school too , and laugh till he cri if you hold up a finger to him ; he will drink himself senseless -- not as a regular vice , but at time , when peopl treat him , like a child . and he stole , too , then , without know it himself , for ‘ how can it be steal , if one pick it up ? ’ and do you know he is an old believ , or rather a dissent ? there have been wander [ * ] in hi famili , and he wa for two year in hi villag under the spiritu guidanc of a certain elder . i learnt all thi from nikolay and from hi fellow villag . and what ’ s more , he want to run into the wilder ! he wa full of fervour , pray at night , read the old book , ‘ the true ’ one , and read himself crazi . [ * ] a religi sect. -- translat ’ s note . “ petersburg had a great effect upon him , especi the women and the wine . he respond to everyth and he forgot the elder and all that . i learnt that an artist here took a fanci to him , and use to go and see him , and now thi busi came upon him . “ well , he wa frighten , he tri to hang himself ! he ran away ! how can one get over the idea the peopl have of russian legal proceed ? the veri word ‘ trial ’ frighten some of them . whose fault is it ? we shall see what the new juri will do . god grant they do good ! well , in prison , it seem , he rememb the vener elder ; the bibl , too , made it appear again . do you know , rodion romanovitch , the forc of the word ‘ suffer ’ among some of these peopl ! it ’ s not a question of suffer for someon ’ s benefit , but simpli , ‘ one must suffer. ’ if they suffer at the hand of the author , so much the better . in my time there wa a veri meek and mild prison who spent a whole year in prison alway read hi bibl on the stove at night and he read himself crazi , and so crazi , do you know , that one day , apropo of noth , he seiz a brick and flung it at the governor ; though he had done him no harm . and the way he threw it too : aim it a yard on one side on purpos , for fear of hurt him . well , we know what happen to a prison who assault an offic with a weapon . so ‘ he took hi suffering. ’ “ so i suspect now that nikolay want to take hi suffer or someth of the sort . i know it for certain from fact , inde . onli he doesn ’ t know that i know . what , you don ’ t admit that there are such fantast peopl among the peasant ? lot of them . the elder now ha begun influenc him , especi sinc he tri to hang himself . but he ’ ll come and tell me all himself . you think he ’ ll hold out ? wait a bit , he ’ ll take hi word back . i am wait from hour to hour for him to come and abjur hi evid . i have come to like that nikolay and am studi him in detail . and what do you think ? he-h ! he answer me veri plausibl on some point , he obvious had collect some evid and prepar himself cleverli . but on other point he is simpli at sea , know noth and doesn ’ t even suspect that he doesn ’ t know ! “ no , rodion romanovitch , nikolay doesn ’ t come in ! thi is a fantast , gloomi busi , a modern case , an incid of to-day when the heart of man is troubl , when the phrase is quot that blood ‘ renew , ’ when comfort is preach as the aim of life . here we have bookish dream , a heart unhing by theori . here we see resolut in the first stage , but resolut of a special kind : he resolv to do it like jump over a precipic or from a bell tower and hi leg shook as he went to the crime . he forgot to shut the door after him , and murder two peopl for a theori . he commit the murder and couldn ’ t take the money , and what he did manag to snatch up he hid under a stone . it wasn ’ t enough for him to suffer agoni behind the door while they batter at the door and rung the bell , no , he had to go to the empti lodg , half deliri , to recal the bell-ring , he want to feel the cold shiver over again .... well , that we grant , wa through ill , but consid thi : he is a murder , but look upon himself as an honest man , despis other , pose as injur innoc . no , that ’ s not the work of a nikolay , my dear rodion romanovitch ! ” all that had been said befor had sound so like a recant that these word were too great a shock . raskolnikov shudder as though he had been stab . “ then ... who then ... is the murder ? ” he ask in a breathless voic , unabl to restrain himself . porfiri petrovitch sank back in hi chair , as though he were amaz at the question . “ who is the murder ? ” he repeat , as though unabl to believ hi ear . “ whi , _you_ , rodion romanovitch ! you are the murder , ” he ad , almost in a whisper , in a voic of genuin convict . raskolnikov leapt from the sofa , stood up for a few second and sat down again without utter a word . hi face twitch convuls . “ your lip is twitch just as it did befor , ” porfiri petrovitch observ almost sympathet . “ you ’ ve been misunderstand me , i think , rodion romanovitch , ” he ad after a brief paus , “ that ’ s whi you are so surpris . i came on purpos to tell you everyth and deal openli with you. ” “ it wa not i murder her , ” raskolnikov whisper like a frighten child caught in the act . “ no , it wa you , you rodion romanovitch , and no one els , ” porfiri whisper sternli , with convict . they were both silent and the silenc last strang long , about ten minut . raskolnikov put hi elbow on the tabl and pass hi finger through hi hair . porfiri petrovitch sat quietli wait . suddenli raskolnikov look scorn at porfiri . “ you are at your old trick again , porfiri petrovitch ! your old method again . i wonder you don ’ t get sick of it ! ” “ oh , stop that , what doe that matter now ? it would be a differ matter if there were wit present , but we are whisper alon . you see yourself that i have not come to chase and captur you like a hare . whether you confess it or not is noth to me now ; for myself , i am convinc without it. ” “ if so , what did you come for ? ” raskolnikov ask irrit . “ i ask you the same question again : if you consid me guilti , whi don ’ t you take me to prison ? ” “ oh , that ’ s your question ! i will answer you , point for point . in the first place , to arrest you so directli is not to my interest. ” “ how so ? if you are convinc you ought .... ” “ ach , what if i am convinc ? that ’ s onli my dream for the time . whi should i put you in safeti ? you know that ’ s it , sinc you ask me to do it . if i confront you with that workman for instanc and you say to him ‘ were you drunk or not ? who saw me with you ? i simpli took you to be drunk , and you were drunk , too. ’ well , what could i answer , especi as your stori is a more like one than hi ? for there ’ s noth but psycholog to support hi evid -- that ’ s almost unseemli with hi ugli mug , while you hit the mark exactli , for the rascal is an inveter drunkard and notori so . and i have myself admit candidli sever time alreadi that that psycholog can be taken in two way and that the second way is stronger and look far more probabl , and that apart from that i have as yet noth against you . and though i shall put you in prison and inde have come -- quit contrari to etiquett -- to inform you of it beforehand , yet i tell you frankli , also contrari to etiquett , that it won ’ t be to my advantag . well , secondli , i ’ ve come to you becaus ... ” “ ye , ye , secondli ? ” raskolnikov wa listen breathless . “ becaus , as i told you just now , i consid i owe you an explan . i don ’ t want you to look upon me as a monster , as i have a genuin like for you , you may believ me or not . and in the third place i ’ ve come to you with a direct and open proposit -- that you should surrend and confess . it will be infinit more to your advantag and to my advantag too , for my task will be done . well , is thi open on my part or not ? ” raskolnikov thought a minut . “ listen , porfiri petrovitch . you said just now you have noth but psycholog to go on , yet now you ’ ve gone on mathemat . well , what if you are mistaken yourself , now ? ” “ no , rodion romanovitch , i am not mistaken . i have a littl fact even then , provid sent it me. ” “ what littl fact ? ” “ i won ’ t tell you what , rodion romanovitch . and in ani case , i haven ’ t the right to put it off ani longer , i must arrest you . so think it over : it make no differ to me _now_ and so i speak onli for your sake . believ me , it will be better , rodion romanovitch. ” raskolnikov smile malignantli . “ that ’ s not simpli ridicul , it ’ s posit shameless . whi , even if i were guilti , which i don ’ t admit , what reason should i have to confess , when you tell me yourself that i shall be in greater safeti in prison ? ” “ ah , rodion romanovitch , don ’ t put too much faith in word , perhap prison will not be altogeth a rest place . that ’ s onli theori and my theori , and what author am i for you ? perhap , too , even now i am hide someth from you ? i can ’ t lay bare everyth , he-h ! and how can you ask what advantag ? don ’ t you know how it would lessen your sentenc ? you would be confess at a moment when anoth man ha taken the crime on himself and so ha muddl the whole case . consid that ! i swear befor god that i will so arrang that your confess shall come as a complet surpris . we will make a clean sweep of all these psycholog point , of a suspicion against you , so that your crime will appear to have been someth like an aberr , for in truth it wa an aberr . i am an honest man , rodion romanovitch , and will keep my word. ” raskolnikov maintain a mourn silenc and let hi head sink dejectedli . he ponder a long while and at last smile again , but hi smile wa sad and gentl . “ no ! ” he said , appar abandon all attempt to keep up appear with porfiri , “ it ’ s not worth it , i don ’ t care about lessen the sentenc ! ” “ that ’ s just what i wa afraid of ! ” porfiri cri warmli and , as it seem , involuntarili . “ that ’ s just what i fear , that you wouldn ’ t care about the mitig of sentence. ” raskolnikov look sadli and express at him . “ ah , don ’ t disdain life ! ” porfiri went on . “ you have a great deal of it still befor you . how can you say you don ’ t want a mitig of sentenc ? you are an impati fellow ! ” “ a great deal of what lie befor me ? ” “ of life . what sort of prophet are you , do you know much about it ? seek and ye shall find . thi may be god ’ s mean for bring you to him . and it ’ s not for ever , the bondag .... ” “ the time will be shorten , ” laugh raskolnikov . “ whi , is it the bourgeoi disgrac you are afraid of ? it may be that you are afraid of it without know it , becaus you are young ! but anyway _you_ shouldn ’ t be afraid of give yourself up and confessing. ” “ ach , hang it ! ” raskolnikov whisper with loath and contempt , as though he did not want to speak aloud . he got up again as though he meant to go away , but sat down again in evid despair . “ hang it , if you like ! you ’ ve lost faith and you think that i am grossli flatter you ; but how long ha your life been ? how much do you understand ? you made up a theori and then were asham that it broke down and turn out to be not at all origin ! it turn out someth base , that ’ s true , but you are not hopelessli base . by no mean so base ! at least you didn ’ t deceiv yourself for long , you went straight to the furthest point at one bound . how do i regard you ? i regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their tortur while he cut their entrail out , if onli they have found faith or god . find it and you will live . you have long need a chang of air . suffer , too , is a good thing . suffer ! mayb nikolay is right in want to suffer . i know you don ’ t believ in it -- but don ’ t be over-wis ; fling yourself straight into life , without deliber ; don ’ t be afraid -- the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again . what bank ? how can i tell ? i onli believ that you have long life befor you . i know that you take all my word now for a set speech prepar beforehand , but mayb you will rememb them after . they may be of use some time . that ’ s whi i speak . it ’ s as well that you onli kill the old woman . if you ’ d invent anoth theori you might perhap have done someth a thousand time more hideou . you ought to thank god , perhap . how do you know ? perhap god is save you for someth . but keep a good heart and have less fear ! are you afraid of the great expiat befor you ? no , it would be shame to be afraid of it . sinc you have taken such a step , you must harden your heart . there is justic in it . you must fulfil the demand of justic . i know that you don ’ t believ it , but inde , life will bring you through . you will live it down in time . what you need now is fresh air , fresh air , fresh air ! ” raskolnikov posit start . “ but who are you ? what prophet are you ? from the height of what majest calm do you proclaim these word of wisdom ? ” “ who am i ? i am a man with noth to hope for , that ’ s all . a man perhap of feel and sympathi , mayb of some knowledg too , but my day is over . but you are a differ matter , there is life wait for you . though , who know ? mayb your life , too , will pass off in smoke and come to noth . come , what doe it matter , that you will pass into anoth class of men ? it ’ s not comfort you regret , with your heart ! what of it that perhap no one will see you for so long ? it ’ s not time , but yourself that will decid that . be the sun and all will see you . the sun ha befor all to be the sun . whi are you smile again ? at my be such a schiller ? i bet you ’ re imagin that i am tri to get round you by flatteri . well , perhap i am , he-he-h ! perhap you ’ d better not believ my word , perhap you ’ d better never believ it altogeth -- i ’ m made that way , i confess it . but let me add , you can judg for yourself , i think , how far i am a base sort of man and how far i am honest. ” “ when do you mean to arrest me ? ” “ well , i can let you walk about anoth day or two . think it over , my dear fellow , and pray to god . it ’ s more in your interest , believ me. ” “ and what if i run away ? ” ask raskolnikov with a strang smile . “ no , you won ’ t run away . a peasant would run away , a fashion dissent would run away , the flunkey of anoth man ’ s thought , for you ’ ve onli to show him the end of your littl finger and he ’ ll be readi to believ in anyth for the rest of hi life . but you ’ ve ceas to believ in your theori alreadi , what will you run away with ? and what would you do in hide ? it would be hate and difficult for you , and what you need more than anyth in life is a definit posit , an atmospher to suit you . and what sort of atmospher would you have ? if you ran away , you ’ d come back to yourself . _you can ’ t get on without us._ and if i put you in prison -- say you ’ ve been there a month , or two , or three -- rememb my word , you ’ ll confess of yourself and perhap to your own surpris . you won ’ t know an hour beforehand that you are come with a confess . i am convinc that you will decid , ‘ to take your suffering. ’ you don ’ t believ my word now , but you ’ ll come to it of yourself . for suffer , rodion romanovitch , is a great thing . never mind my have grown fat , i know all the same . don ’ t laugh at it , there ’ s an idea in suffer , nikolay is right . no , you won ’ t run away , rodion romanovitch. ” raskolnikov got up and took hi cap . porfiri petrovitch also rose . “ are you go for a walk ? the even will be fine , if onli we don ’ t have a storm . though it would be a good thing to freshen the air. ” he , too , took hi cap . “ porfiri petrovitch , pleas don ’ t take up the notion that i have confess to you to-day , ” raskolnikov pronounc with sullen insist . “ you ’ re a strang man and i have listen to you from simpl curios . but i have admit noth , rememb that ! ” “ oh , i know that , i ’ ll rememb . look at him , he ’ s trembl ! don ’ t be uneasi , my dear fellow , have it your own way . walk about a bit , you won ’ t be abl to walk too far . if anyth happen , i have one request to make of you , ” he ad , drop hi voic . “ it ’ s an awkward one , but import . if anyth were to happen ( though inde i don ’ t believ in it and think you quit incap of it ) , yet in case you were taken dure these forti or fifti hour with the notion of put an end to the busi in some other way , in some fantast fashion -- lay hand on yourself -- ( it ’ s an absurd proposit , but you must forgiv me for it ) do leav a brief but precis note , onli two line , and mention the stone . it will be more gener . come , till we meet ! good thought and sound decis to you ! ” porfiri went out , stoop and avoid look at raskolnikov . the latter went to the window and wait with irrit impati till he calcul that porfiri had reach the street and move away . then he too went hurriedli out of the room . chapter iii he hurri to svidrigaïlov ’ s . what he had to hope from that man he did not know . but that man had some hidden power over him . have onc recognis thi , he could not rest , and now the time had come . on the way , one question particularli worri him : had svidrigaïlov been to porfiri ’ s ? as far as he could judg , he would swear to it , that he had not . he ponder again and again , went over porfiri ’ s visit ; no , he hadn ’ t been , of cours he hadn ’ t . but if he had not been yet , would he go ? meanwhil , for the present he fanci he couldn ’ t . whi ? he could not have explain , but if he could , he would not have wast much thought over it at the moment . it all worri him and at the same time he could not attend to it . strang to say , none would have believ it perhap , but he onli felt a faint vagu anxieti about hi immedi futur . anoth , much more import anxieti torment him -- it concern himself , but in a differ , more vital way . moreov , he wa consciou of immens moral fatigu , though hi mind wa work better that morn than it had done of late . and wa it worth while , after all that had happen , to contend with these new trivial difficulti ? wa it worth while , for instanc , to manoeuvr that svidrigaïlov should not go to porfiri ’ s ? wa it worth while to investig , to ascertain the fact , to wast time over anyon like svidrigaïlov ? oh , how sick he wa of it all ! and yet he wa hasten to svidrigaïlov ; could he be expect someth _new_ from him , inform , or mean of escap ? men will catch at straw ! wa it destini or some instinct bring them togeth ? perhap it wa onli fatigu , despair ; perhap it wa not svidrigaïlov but some other whom he need , and svidrigaïlov had simpli present himself by chanc . sonia ? but what should he go to sonia for now ? to beg her tear again ? he wa afraid of sonia , too . sonia stood befor him as an irrevoc sentenc . he must go hi own way or her . at that moment especi he did not feel equal to see her . no , would it not be better to tri svidrigaïlov ? and he could not help inwardli own that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason . but what could they have in common ? their veri evil-do could not be of the same kind . the man , moreov , wa veri unpleas , evid deprav , undoubtedli cun and deceit , possibl malign . such stori were told about him . it is true he wa befriend katerina ivanovna ’ s children , but who could tell with what motiv and what it meant ? the man alway had some design , some project . there wa anoth thought which had been continu hover of late about raskolnikov ’ s mind , and caus him great uneasi . it wa so pain that he made distinct effort to get rid of it . he sometim thought that svidrigaïlov wa dog hi footstep . svidrigaïlov had found out hi secret and had had design on dounia . what if he had them still ? wasn ’ t it practic certain that he had ? and what if , have learnt hi secret and so have gain power over him , he were to use it as a weapon against dounia ? thi idea sometim even torment hi dream , but it had never present itself so vividli to him as on hi way to svidrigaïlov . the veri thought move him to gloomi rage . to begin with , thi would transform everyth , even hi own posit ; he would have at onc to confess hi secret to dounia . would he have to give himself up perhap to prevent dounia from take some rash step ? the letter ? thi morn dounia had receiv a letter . from whom could she get letter in petersburg ? luzhin , perhap ? it ’ s true razumihin wa there to protect her , but razumihin knew noth of the posit . perhap it wa hi duti to tell razumihin ? he thought of it with repugn . in ani case he must see svidrigaïlov as soon as possibl , he decid final . thank god , the detail of the interview were of littl consequ , if onli he could get at the root of the matter ; but if svidrigaïlov were capabl ... if he were intrigu against dounia -- then ... raskolnikov wa so exhaust by what he had pass through that month that he could onli decid such question in one way ; “ then i shall kill him , ” he thought in cold despair . a sudden anguish oppress hi heart , he stood still in the middl of the street and began look about to see where he wa and which way he wa go . he found himself in x . prospect , thirti or forti pace from the hay market , through which he had come . the whole second storey of the hous on the left wa use as a tavern . all the window were wide open ; judg from the figur move at the window , the room were full to overflow . there were sound of sing , of clarionet and violin , and the boom of a turkish drum . he could hear women shriek . he wa about to turn back wonder whi he had come to the x . prospect , when suddenli at one of the end window he saw svidrigaïlov , sit at a tea-tabl right in the open window with a pipe in hi mouth . raskolnikov wa dread taken aback , almost terrifi . svidrigaïlov wa silent watch and scrutinis him and , what struck raskolnikov at onc , seem to be mean to get up and slip away unobserv . raskolnikov at onc pretend not to have seen him , but to be look absent-mindedli away , while he watch him out of the corner of hi eye . hi heart wa beat violent . yet , it wa evid that svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen . he took the pipe out of hi mouth and wa on the point of conceal himself , but as he got up and move back hi chair , he seem to have becom suddenli awar that raskolnikov had seen him , and wa watch him . what had pass between them wa much the same as what happen at their first meet in raskolnikov ’ s room . a sli smile came into svidrigaïlov ’ s face and grew broader and broader . each knew that he wa seen and watch by the other . at last svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh . “ well , well , come in if you want me ; i am here ! ” he shout from the window . raskolnikov went up into the tavern . he found svidrigaïlov in a tini back room , adjoin the saloon in which merchant , clerk and number of peopl of all sort were drink tea at twenti littl tabl to the desper bawl of a choru of singer . the click of billiard ball could be heard in the distanc . on the tabl befor svidrigaïlov stood an open bottl and a glass half full of champagn . in the room he found also a boy with a littl hand organ , a healthy-look red-cheek girl of eighteen , wear a tucked-up stripe skirt , and a tyroles hat with ribbon . in spite of the choru in the other room , she wa sing some servant ’ hall song in a rather huski contralto , to the accompani of the organ . “ come , that ’ s enough , ” svidrigaïlov stop her at raskolnikov ’ s entranc . the girl at onc broke off and stood wait respect . she had sung her guttur rhyme , too , with a seriou and respect express in her face . “ hey , philip , a glass ! ” shout svidrigaïlov . “ i won ’ t drink anyth , ” said raskolnikov . “ as you like , i didn ’ t mean it for you . drink , katia ! i don ’ t want anyth more to-day , you can go. ” he pour her out a full glass , and laid down a yellow note . katia drank off her glass of wine , as women do , without put it down , in twenti gulp , took the note and kiss svidrigaïlov ’ s hand , which he allow quit serious . she went out of the room and the boy trail after her with the organ . both had been brought in from the street . svidrigaïlov had not been a week in petersburg , but everyth about him wa alreadi , so to speak , on a patriarch foot ; the waiter , philip , wa by now an old friend and veri obsequi . the door lead to the saloon had a lock on it . svidrigaïlov wa at home in thi room and perhap spent whole day in it . the tavern wa dirti and wretch , not even second-r . “ i wa go to see you and look for you , ” raskolnikov began , “ but i don ’ t know what made me turn from the hay market into the x . prospect just now . i never take thi turn . i turn to the right from the hay market . and thi isn ’ t the way to you . i simpli turn and here you are . it is strang ! ” “ whi don ’ t you say at onc ‘ it ’ s a miracl ’ ? ” “ becaus it may be onli chance. ” “ oh , that ’ s the way with all you folk , ” laugh svidrigaïlov . “ you won ’ t admit it , even if you do inwardli believ it a miracl ! here you say that it may be onli chanc . and what coward they all are here , about have an opinion of their own , you can ’ t fanci , rodion romanovitch . i don ’ t mean you , you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it . that ’ s how it wa you attract my curiosity. ” “ noth els ? ” “ well , that ’ s enough , you know , ” svidrigaïlov wa obvious exhilar , but onli slightli so , he had not had more than half a glass of wine . “ i fanci you came to see me befor you knew that i wa capabl of have what you call an opinion of my own , ” observ raskolnikov . “ oh , well , it wa a differ matter . everyon ha hi own plan . and apropo of the miracl let me tell you that i think you have been asleep for the last two or three day . i told you of thi tavern myself , there is no miracl in your come straight here . i explain the way myself , told you where it wa , and the hour you could find me here . do you rememb ? ” “ i don ’ t rememb , ” answer raskolnikov with surpris . “ i believ you . i told you twice . the address ha been stamp mechan on your memori . you turn thi way mechan and yet precis accord to the direct , though you are not awar of it . when i told you then , i hardli hope you understood me . you give yourself away too much , rodion romanovitch . and anoth thing , i ’ m convinc there are lot of peopl in petersburg who talk to themselv as they walk . thi is a town of crazi peopl . if onli we had scientif men , doctor , lawyer and philosoph might make most valuabl investig in petersburg each in hi own line . there are few place where there are so mani gloomi , strong and queer influenc on the soul of man as in petersburg . the mere influenc of climat mean so much . and it ’ s the administr centr of all russia and it charact must be reflect on the whole countri . but that is neither here nor there now . the point is that i have sever time watch you . you walk out of your hous -- hold your head high -- twenti pace from home you let it sink , and fold your hand behind your back . you look and evid see noth befor nor besid you . at last you begin move your lip and talk to yourself , and sometim you wave one hand and declaim , and at last stand still in the middl of the road . that ’ s not at all the thing . someon may be watch you besid me , and it won ’ t do you ani good . it ’ s noth realli to do with me and i can ’ t cure you , but , of cours , you understand me. ” “ do you know that i am be follow ? ” ask raskolnikov , look inquisit at him . “ no , i know noth about it , ” said svidrigaïlov , seem surpris . “ well , then , let us leav me alon , ” raskolnikov mutter , frown . “ veri good , let us leav you alone. ” “ you had better tell me , if you come here to drink , and direct me twice to come here to you , whi did you hide , and tri to get away just now when i look at the window from the street ? i saw it. ” “ he-h ! and whi wa it you lay on your sofa with close eye and pretend to be asleep , though you were wide awak while i stood in your doorway ? i saw it. ” “ i may have had ... reason . you know that yourself. ” “ and i may have had my reason , though you don ’ t know them. ” raskolnikov drop hi right elbow on the tabl , lean hi chin in the finger of hi right hand , and stare intent at svidrigaïlov . for a full minut he scrutinis hi face , which had impress him befor . it wa a strang face , like a mask ; white and red , with bright red lip , with a flaxen beard , and still thick flaxen hair . hi eye were somehow too blue and their express somehow too heavi and fix . there wa someth aw unpleas in that handsom face , which look so wonder young for hi age . svidrigaïlov wa smartli dress in light summer cloth and wa particularli dainti in hi linen . he wore a huge ring with a preciou stone in it . “ have i got to bother myself about you , too , now ? ” said raskolnikov suddenli , come with nervou impati straight to the point . “ even though perhap you are the most danger man if you care to injur me , i don ’ t want to put myself out ani more . i will show you at onc that i don ’ t prize myself as you probabl think i do . i ’ ve come to tell you at onc that if you keep to your former intent with regard to my sister and if you think to deriv ani benefit in that direct from what ha been discov of late , i will kill you befor you get me lock up . you can reckon on my word . you know that i can keep it . and in the second place if you want to tell me anyth -- for i keep fanci all thi time that you have someth to tell me -- make hast and tell it , for time is preciou and veri like it will soon be too late. ” “ whi in such hast ? ” ask svidrigaïlov , look at him curious . “ everyon ha hi plan , ” raskolnikov answer gloomili and impati . “ you urg me yourself to frank just now , and at the first question you refus to answer , ” svidrigaïlov observ with a smile . “ you keep fanci that i have aim of my own and so you look at me with suspicion . of cours it ’ s perfectli natur in your posit . but though i should like to be friend with you , i shan ’ t troubl myself to convinc you of the contrari . the game isn ’ t worth the candl and i wasn ’ t intend to talk to you about anyth special. ” “ what did you want me , for , then ?

ha-ha-ha ! still i must admit that your question is rather complex , and is difficult for me to answer . here , you , for instanc , have come to me not onli for a definit object , but for the sake of hear someth new . isn ’ t that so ? isn ’ t that so ? ” persist svidrigaïlov with a sli smile . “ well , can ’ t you fanci then that i , too , on my way here in the train wa reckon on you , on your tell me someth new , and on my make some profit out of you ! you see what rich men we are ! ” “ what profit could you make ? ” “ how can i tell you ? how do i know ? you see in what a tavern i spend all my time and it ’ s my enjoy , that ’ s to say it ’ s no great enjoy , but one must sit somewher ; that poor katia now -- you saw her ? ... if onli i had been a glutton now , a club gourmand , but you see i can eat this. ” he point to a littl tabl in the corner where the remnant of a terrible-look beef-steak and potato lay on a tin dish . “ have you dine , by the way ? i ’ ve had someth and want noth more . i don ’ t drink , for instanc , at all . except for champagn i never touch anyth , and not more than a glass of that all the even , and even that is enough to make my head ach . i order it just now to wind myself up , for i am just go off somewher and you see me in a peculiar state of mind . that wa whi i hid myself just now like a schoolboy , for i wa afraid you would hinder me . but i believ , ” he pull out hi watch , “ i can spend an hour with you . it ’ s half-past four now . if onli i ’ d been someth , a landown , a father , a cavalri offic , a photograph , a journalist ... i am noth , no specialti , and sometim i am posit bore . i realli thought you would tell me someth new. ” “ but what are you , and whi have you come here ?

” “ whi , you might have challeng them ... altogeth it must have been lively. ” “ i won ’ t contradict you , and besid i am no hand at philosophi . i confess that i hasten here for the sake of the women. ” “ as soon as you buri marfa petrovna ? ” “ quit so , ” svidrigaïlov smile with engag candour . “ what of it ? you seem to find someth wrong in my speak like that about women ? ” “ you ask whether i find anyth wrong in vice ? ” “ vice ! oh , that ’ s what you are after ! but i ’ ll answer you in order , first about women in gener ; you know i am fond of talk . tell me , what should i restrain myself for ? whi should i give up women , sinc i have a passion for them ? it ’ s an occup , anyway. ” “ so you hope for noth here but vice ? ” “ oh , veri well , for vice then . you insist on it be vice . but anyway i like a direct question . in thi vice at least there is someth perman , found inde upon natur and not depend on fantasi , someth present in the blood like an ever-burn ember , for ever set one on fire and , mayb , not to be quickli extinguish , even with year . you ’ ll agre it ’ s an occup of a sort. ” “ that ’ s noth to rejoic at , it ’ s a diseas and a danger one. ” “ oh , that ’ s what you think , is it ! i agre , that it is a diseas like everyth that exce moder . and , of cours , in thi one must exceed moder . but in the first place , everybodi doe so in one way or anoth , and in the second place , of cours , one ought to be moder and prudent , howev mean it may be , but what am i to do ? if i hadn ’ t thi , i might have to shoot myself . i am readi to admit that a decent man ought to put up with be bore , but yet ... ” “ and could you shoot yourself ? ” “ oh , come ! ” svidrigaïlov parri with disgust . “ pleas don ’ t speak of it , ” he ad hurriedli and with none of the brag tone he had shown in all the previou convers . hi face quit chang . “ i admit it ’ s an unpardon weak , but i can ’ t help it . i am afraid of death and i dislik it be talk of . do you know that i am to a certain extent a mystic ? ” “ ah , the apparit of marfa petrovna ! do they still go on visit you ? ” “ oh , don ’ t talk of them ; there have been no more in petersburg , confound them ! ” he cri with an air of irrit . “ let ’ s rather talk of that ... though ... h ’ m ! i have not much time , and can ’ t stay long with you , it ’ s a piti ! i should have found plenti to tell you. ” “ what ’ s your engag , a woman ? ” “ ye , a woman , a casual incid .... no , that ’ s not what i want to talk of. ” “ and the hideous , the filthi of all your surround , doesn ’ t that affect you ? have you lost the strength to stop yourself ? ” “ and do you pretend to strength , too ? he-he-h ! you surpris me just now , rodion romanovitch , though i knew beforehand it would be so . you preach to me about vice and æsthetic ! you -- a schiller , you -- an idealist ! of cours that ’ s all as it should be and it would be surpris if it were not so , yet it is strang in realiti .... ah , what a piti i have no time , for you ’ re a most interest type ! and , by-the-way , are you fond of schiller ? i am aw fond of him. ” “ but what a braggart you are , ” raskolnikov said with some disgust . “ upon my word , i am not , ” answer svidrigaïlov laugh . “ howev , i won ’ t disput it , let me be a braggart , whi not brag , if it hurt no one ? i spent seven year in the countri with marfa petrovna , so now when i come across an intellig person like you -- intellig and highli interest -- i am simpli glad to talk and , besid , i ’ ve drunk that half-glass of champagn and it ’ s gone to my head a littl . and besid , there ’ s a certain fact that ha wound me up tremend , but about that i ... will keep quiet . where are you off to ? ” he ask in alarm . raskolnikov had begun get up . he felt oppress and stifl and , as it were , ill at eas at have come here . he felt convinc that svidrigaïlov wa the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth . “ a-ach ! sit down , stay a littl ! ” svidrigaïlov beg . “ let them bring you some tea , anyway . stay a littl , i won ’ t talk nonsens , about myself , i mean . i ’ ll tell you someth . if you like i ’ ll tell you how a woman tri ‘ to save ’ me , as you would call it ? it will be an answer to your first question inde , for the woman wa your sister . may i tell you ? it will help to spend the time. ” “ tell me , but i trust that you ... ” “ oh , don ’ t be uneasi . besid , even in a worthless low fellow like me , avdotya romanovna can onli excit the deepest respect. ” chapter iv “ you know perhap -- ye , i told you myself , ” began svidrigaïlov , “ that i wa in the debtor ’ prison here , for an immens sum , and had not ani expect of be abl to pay it . there ’ s no need to go into particular how marfa petrovna bought me out ; do you know to what a point of insan a woman can sometim love ? she wa an honest woman , and veri sensibl , although complet uneduc . would you believ that thi honest and jealou woman , after mani scene of hyster and reproach , condescend to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept throughout our marri life ? she wa consider older than i , and besid , she alway kept a clove or someth in her mouth . there wa so much swinish in my soul and honesti too , of a sort , as to tell her straight out that i couldn ’ t be absolut faith to her . thi confess drove her to frenzi , but yet she seem in a way to have like my brutal frank . she thought it show i wa unwil to deceiv her if i warn her like thi beforehand and for a jealou woman , you know , that ’ s the first consider . after mani tear an unwritten contract wa drawn up between us : first , that i would never leav marfa petrovna and would alway be her husband ; secondli , that i would never absent myself without her permiss ; thirdli , that i would never set up a perman mistress ; fourthli , in return for thi , marfa petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidserv , but onli with her secret knowledg ; fifthli , god forbid my fall in love with a woman of our class ; sixthli , in case i -- which god forbid -- should be visit by a great seriou passion i wa bound to reveal it to marfa petrovna . on thi last score , howev , marfa petrovna wa fairli at eas . she wa a sensibl woman and so she could not help look upon me as a dissolut proflig incap of real love . but a sensibl woman and a jealou woman are two veri differ thing , and that ’ s where the troubl came in . but to judg some peopl imparti we must renounc certain preconceiv opinion and our habitu attitud to the ordinari peopl about us . i have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyon ’ s . perhap you have alreadi heard a great deal that wa ridicul and absurd about marfa petrovna . she certainli had some veri ridicul way , but i tell you frankli that i feel realli sorri for the innumer woe of which i wa the caus . well , and that ’ s enough , i think , by way of a decor _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife of a most tender husband . when we quarrel , i usual held my tongu and did not irrit her and that gentlemanli conduct rare fail to attain it object , it influenc her , it pleas her , inde . these were time when she wa posit proud of me . but your sister she couldn ’ t put up with , anyway . and howev she came to risk take such a beauti creatur into her hous as a gover . my explan is that marfa petrovna wa an ardent and impression woman and simpli fell in love herself -- liter fell in love -- with your sister . well , littl wonder -- look at avdotya romanovna ! i saw the danger at the first glanc and what do you think , i resolv not to look at her even . but avdotya romanovna herself made the first step , would you believ it ? would you believ it too that marfa petrovna wa posit angri with me at first for my persist silenc about your sister , for my careless recept of her continu ador prais of avdotya romanovna . i don ’ t know what it wa she want ! well , of cours , marfa petrovna told avdotya romanovna everi detail about me . she had the unfortun habit of tell liter everyon all our famili secret and continu complain of me ; how could she fail to confid in such a delight new friend ? i expect they talk of noth els but me and no doubt avdotya romanovna heard all those dark mysteri rumour that were current about me .... i don ’ t mind bet that you too have heard someth of the sort alreadi ? ” “ i have . luzhin charg you with have caus the death of a child . is that true ? ” “ don ’ t refer to those vulgar tale , i beg , ” said svidrigaïlov with disgust and annoy . “ if you insist on want to know about all that idioci , i will tell you one day , but now ... ” “ i wa told too about some footman of your in the countri whom you treat badly. ” “ i beg you to drop the subject , ” svidrigaïlov interrupt again with obviou impati . “ wa that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe ? ... you told me about it yourself. ” raskolnikov felt more and more irrit . svidrigaïlov look at him attent and raskolnikov fanci he caught a flash of spite mockeri in that look . but svidrigaïlov restrain himself and answer veri civilli : “ ye , it wa . i see that you , too , are extrem interest and shall feel it my duti to satisfi your curios at the first opportun . upon my soul ! i see that i realli might pass for a romant figur with some peopl . judg how grate i must be to marfa petrovna for have repeat to avdotya romanovna such mysteri and interest gossip about me . i dare not guess what impress it made on her , but in ani case it work in my interest . with all avdotya romanovna ’ s natur avers and in spite of my invari gloomi and repel aspect -- she did at least feel piti for me , piti for a lost soul . and if onc a girl ’ s heart is move to _pity_ , it ’ s more danger than anyth . she is bound to want to ‘ save him , ’ to bring him to hi sens , and lift him up and draw him to nobler aim , and restor him to new life and use -- well , we all know how far such dream can go . i saw at onc that the bird wa fli into the cage of herself . and i too made readi . i think you are frown , rodion romanovitch ? there ’ s no need . as you know , it all end in smoke . ( hang it all , what a lot i am drink ! ) do you know , i alway , from the veri begin , regret that it wasn ’ t your sister ’ s fate to be born in the second or third centuri a.d. , as the daughter of a reign princ or some governor or pro-consul in asia minor . she would undoubtedli have been one of those who would endur martyrdom and would have smile when they brand her bosom with hot pincer . and she would have gone to it of herself . and in the fourth or fifth centuri she would have walk away into the egyptian desert and would have stay there thirti year live on root and ecstasi and vision . she is simpli thirst to face some tortur for someon , and if she can ’ t get her tortur , she ’ ll throw herself out of a window . i ’ ve heard someth of a mr. razumihin -- he ’ s said to be a sensibl fellow ; hi surnam suggest it , inde . he ’ s probabl a divin student . well , he ’ d better look after your sister ! i believ i understand her , and i am proud of it . but at the begin of an acquaint , as you know , one is apt to be more heedless and stupid . one doesn ’ t see clearli . hang it all , whi is she so handsom ? it ’ s not my fault . in fact , it began on my side with a most irresist physic desir . avdotya romanovna is aw chast , incred and phenomen so . take note , i tell you thi about your sister as a fact . she is almost morbidli chast , in spite of her broad intellig , and it will stand in her way . there happen to be a girl in the hous then , parasha , a black-ey wench , whom i had never seen befor -- she had just come from anoth villag -- veri pretti , but incred stupid : she burst into tear , wail so that she could be heard all over the place and caus scandal . one day after dinner avdotya romanovna follow me into an avenu in the garden and with flash eye _insisted_ on my leav poor parasha alon . it wa almost our first convers by ourselv . i , of cours , wa onli too pleas to obey her wish , tri to appear disconcert , embarrass , in fact play my part not badli . then came interview , mysteri convers , exhort , entreati , supplic , even tear -- would you believ it , even tear ? think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girl to ! i , of cours , threw it all on my destini , pose as hunger and thirst for light , and final resort to the most power weapon in the subject of the femal heart , a weapon which never fail one . it ’ s the well-known resourc -- flatteri . noth in the world is harder than speak the truth and noth easier than flatteri . if there ’ s the hundredth part of a fals note in speak the truth , it lead to a discord , and that lead to troubl . but if all , to the last note , is fals in flatteri , it is just as agreeabl , and is heard not without satisfact . it may be a coars satisfact , but still a satisfact . and howev coars the flatteri , at least half will be sure to seem true . that ’ s so for all stage of develop and class of societi . a vestal virgin might be seduc by flatteri . i can never rememb without laughter how i onc seduc a ladi who wa devot to her husband , her children , and her principl . what fun it wa and how littl troubl ! and the ladi realli had principl -- of her own , anyway . all my tactic lay in simpli be utterli annihil and prostrat befor her puriti . i flatter her shamelessli , and as soon as i succeed in get a pressur of the hand , even a glanc from her , i would reproach myself for have snatch it by forc , and would declar that she had resist , so that i could never have gain anyth but for my be so unprincipl . i maintain that she wa so innoc that she could not forese my treacheri , and yield to me unconsci , unawar , and so on . in fact , i triumph , while my ladi remain firmli convinc that she wa innoc , chast , and faith to all her duti and oblig and had succumb quit by accid . and how angri she wa with me when i explain to her at last that it wa my sincer convict that she wa just as eager as i . poor marfa petrovna wa aw weak on the side of flatteri , and if i had onli care to , i might have had all her properti settl on me dure her lifetim . ( i am drink an aw lot of wine now and talk too much . ) i hope you won ’ t be angri if i mention now that i wa begin to produc the same effect on avdotya romanovna . but i wa stupid and impati and spoil it all . avdotya romanovna had sever time -- and one time in particular -- been greatli displeas by the express of my eye , would you believ it ? there wa sometim a light in them which frighten her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguard till it wa hate to her . no need to go into detail , but we part . there i act stupidli again . i fell to jeer in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and effort to convert me ; parasha came on to the scene again , and not she alon ; in fact there wa a tremend to-do . ah , rodion romanovitch , if you could onli see how your sister ’ s eye can flash sometim ! never mind my be drunk at thi moment and have had a whole glass of wine . i am speak the truth . i assur you that thi glanc ha haunt my dream ; the veri rustl of her dress wa more than i could stand at last . i realli began to think that i might becom epilept . i could never have believ that i could be move to such a frenzi . it wa essenti , inde , to be reconcil , but by then it wa imposs . and imagin what i did then ! to what a pitch of stupid a man can be brought by frenzi ! never undertak anyth in a frenzi , rodion romanovitch . i reflect that avdotya romanovna wa after all a beggar ( ach , excus me , that ’ s not the word ... but doe it matter if it express the mean ? ) , that she live by her work , that she had her mother and you to keep ( ach , hang it , you are frown again ) , and i resolv to offer her all my money -- thirti thousand roubl i could have realis then -- if she would run away with me here , to petersburg . of cours i should have vow etern love , raptur , and so on . do you know , i wa so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison marfa petrovna or to cut her throat and to marri herself , it would have been done at onc ! but it end in the catastroph of which you know alreadi . you can fanci how frantic i wa when i heard that marfa petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelli attorney , luzhin , and had almost made a match between them -- which would realli have been just the same thing as i wa propos . wouldn ’ t it ? wouldn ’ t it ? i notic that you ’ ve begun to be veri attent ... you interest young man .... ” svidrigaïlov struck the tabl with hi fist impati . he wa flush . raskolnikov saw clearli that the glass or glass and a half of champagn that he had sip almost unconsci wa affect him -- and he resolv to take advantag of the opportun . he felt veri suspici of svidrigaïlov . “ well , after what you have said , i am fulli convinc that you have come to petersburg with design on my sister , ” he said directli to svidrigaïlov , in order to irrit him further . “ oh , nonsens , ” said svidrigaïlov , seem to rous himself . “ whi , i told you ... besid your sister can ’ t endur me. ” “ ye , i am certain that she can ’ t , but that ’ s not the point. ” “ are you so sure that she can ’ t ? ” svidrigaïlov screw up hi eye and smile mockingli . “ you are right , she doesn ’ t love me , but you can never be sure of what ha pass between husband and wife or lover and mistress . there ’ s alway a littl corner which remain a secret to the world and is onli known to those two . will you answer for it that avdotya romanovna regard me with avers ? ” “ from some word you ’ ve drop , i notic that you still have design -- and of cours evil one -- on dounia and mean to carri them out promptly. ” “ what , have i drop word like that ? ” svidrigaïlov ask in naïv dismay , take not the slightest notic of the epithet bestow on hi design . “ whi , you are drop them even now . whi are you so frighten ? what are you so afraid of now ? ” “ me -- afraid ? afraid of you ? you have rather to be afraid of me , _cher ami_ . but what nonsens .... i ’ ve drunk too much though , i see that . i wa almost say too much again . damn the wine ! hi ! there , water ! ” he snatch up the champagn bottl and flung it without ceremoni out of the window . philip brought the water . “ that ’ s all nonsens ! ” said svidrigaïlov , wet a towel and put it to hi head . “ but i can answer you in one word and annihil all your suspicion . do you know that i am go to get marri ? ” “ you told me so before. ” “ did i ? i ’ ve forgotten . but i couldn ’ t have told you so for certain for i had not even seen my betroth ; i onli meant to . but now i realli have a betroth and it ’ s a settl thing , and if it weren ’ t that i have busi that can ’ t be put off , i would have taken you to see them at onc , for i should like to ask your advic . ach , hang it , onli ten minut left ! see , look at the watch . but i must tell you , for it ’ s an interest stori , my marriag , in it own way . where are you off to ? go again ? ” “ no , i ’ m not go away now. ” “ not at all ? we shall see . i ’ ll take you there , i ’ ll show you my betroth , onli not now . for you ’ ll soon have to be off . you have to go to the right and i to the left . do you know that madam resslich , the woman i am lodg with now , eh ? i know what you ’ re think , that she ’ s the woman whose girl they say drown herself in the winter . come , are you listen ? she arrang it all for me . you ’ re bore , she said , you want someth to fill up your time . for , you know , i am a gloomi , depress person . do you think i ’ m light-heart ? no , i ’ m gloomi . i do no harm , but sit in a corner without speak a word for three day at a time . and that resslich is a sli hussi , i tell you . i know what she ha got in her mind ; she think i shall get sick of it , abandon my wife and depart , and she ’ ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her -- in our class , of cours , or higher . she told me the father wa a broken-down retir offici , who ha been sit in a chair for the last three year with hi leg paralys . the mamma , she said , wa a sensibl woman . there is a son serv in the provinc , but he doesn ’ t help ; there is a daughter , who is marri , but she doesn ’ t visit them . and they ’ ve two littl nephew on their hand , as though their own children were not enough , and they ’ ve taken from school their youngest daughter , a girl who ’ ll be sixteen in anoth month , so that then she can be marri . she wa for me . we went there . how funni it wa ! i present myself -- a landown , a widow , of a well-known name , with connect , with a fortun . what if i am fifti and she is not sixteen ? who think of that ? but it ’ s fascin , isn ’ t it ? it is fascin , ha-ha ! you should have seen how i talk to the papa and mamma . it wa worth pay to have seen me at that moment . she come in , curtsey , you can fanci , still in a short frock -- an unopen bud ! flush like a sunset -- she had been told , no doubt . i don ’ t know how you feel about femal face , but to my mind these sixteen year , these childish eye , shyness and tear of bash are better than beauti ; and she is a perfect littl pictur , too . fair hair in littl curl , like a lamb ’ s , full littl rosi lip , tini feet , a charmer ! ... well , we made friend . i told them i wa in a hurri owe to domest circumst , and the next day , that is the day befor yesterday , we were betroth . when i go now i take her on my knee at onc and keep her there .... well , she flush like a sunset and i kiss her everi minut . her mamma of cours impress on her that thi is her husband and that thi must be so . it ’ s simpli delici ! the present betroth condit is perhap better than marriag . here you have what is call _la natur et la vérité_ , ha-ha ! i ’ ve talk to her twice , she is far from a fool . sometim she steal a look at me that posit scorch me . her face is like raphael ’ s madonna . you know , the sistin madonna ’ s face ha someth fantast in it , the face of mourn religi ecstasi . haven ’ t you notic it ? well , she ’ s someth in that line . the day after we ’ d been betroth , i bought her present to the valu of fifteen hundr roubl -- a set of diamond and anoth of pearl and a silver dressing-cas as larg as thi , with all sort of thing in it , so that even my madonna ’ s face glow . i sat her on my knee , yesterday , and i suppos rather too unceremoni -- she flush crimson and the tear start , but she didn ’ t want to show it . we were left alon , she suddenli flung herself on my neck ( for the first time of her own accord ) , put her littl arm round me , kiss me , and vow that she would be an obedi , faith , and good wife , would make me happi , would devot all her life , everi minut of her life , would sacrific everyth , everyth , and that all she ask in return is my _respect_ , and that she want ‘ noth , noth more from me , no presents. ’ you ’ ll admit that to hear such a confess , alon , from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock , with littl curl , with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheek and tear of enthusiasm in her eye is rather fascin ! isn ’ t it fascin ? it ’ s worth pay for , isn ’ t it ? well ... listen , we ’ ll go to see my betroth , onli not just now ! ” “ the fact is thi monstrou differ in age and develop excit your sensual ! will you realli make such a marriag ? ” “ whi , of cours . everyon think of himself , and he live most gaili who know best how to deceiv himself . ha-ha ! but whi are you

moment , and now you tell me not to listen at door . if that ’ s how you feel , go and inform the polic that you had thi mischanc : you made a littl mistak in your theori . but if you are convinc that one mustn ’ t listen at door , but one may murder old women at one ’ s pleasur , you ’ d better be off to america and make hast . run , young man ! there may still be time . i ’ m speak sincer . haven ’ t you the money ? i ’ ll give you the fare. ” “ i ’ m not think of that at all , ” raskolnikov interrupt with disgust . “ i understand ( but don ’ t put yourself out , don ’ t discuss it if you don ’ t want to ) . i understand the question you are worri over -- moral one , aren ’ t they ? duti of citizen and man ? lay them all asid . they are noth to you now , ha-ha ! you ’ ll say you are still a man and a citizen . if so you ought not to have got into thi coil . it ’ s no use take up a job you are not fit for . well , you ’ d better shoot yourself , or don ’ t you want to ? ” “ you seem tri to enrag me , to make me leav you. ” “ what a queer fellow ! but here we are . welcom to the staircas . you see , that ’ s the way to sofya semyonovna . look , there is no one at home . don ’ t you believ me ? ask kapernaumov . she leav the key with him . here is madam de kapernaumov herself . hey , what ? she is rather deaf . ha she gone out ? where ? did you hear ? she is not in and won ’ t be till late in the even probabl . well , come to my room ; you want to come and see me , didn ’ t you ? here we are . madam resslich ’ s not at home . she is a woman who is alway busi , an excel woman i assur you .... she might have been of use to you if you had been a littl more sensibl . now , see ! i take thi five-per-c bond out of the bureau -- see what a lot i ’ ve got of them still -- thi one will be turn into cash to-day . i mustn ’ t wast ani more time . the bureau is lock , the flat is lock , and here we are again on the stair . shall we take a cab ? i ’ m go to the island . would you like a lift ? i ’ ll take thi carriag . ah , you refus ? you are tire of it ! come for a drive ! i believ it will come on to rain . never mind , we ’ ll put down the hood .... ” svidrigaïlov wa alreadi in the carriag . raskolnikov decid that hi suspicion were at least for that moment unjust . without answer a word he turn and walk back toward the hay market . if he had onli turn round on hi way he might have seen svidrigaïlov get out not a hundr pace off , dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement . but he had turn the corner and could see noth . intens disgust drew him away from svidrigaïlov . “ to think that i could for one instant have look for help from that coars brute , that deprav sensualist and blackguard ! ” he cri . raskolnikov ’ s judgment wa utter too lightli and hastili : there wa someth about svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain origin , even a mysteri charact . as concern hi sister , raskolnikov wa convinc that svidrigaïlov would not leav her in peac . but it wa too tiresom and unbear to go on think and think about thi . when he wa alon , he had not gone twenti pace befor he sank , as usual , into deep thought . on the bridg he stood by the rail and began gaze at the water . and hi sister wa stand close by him . he met her at the entranc to the bridg , but pass by without see her . dounia had never met him like thi in the street befor and wa struck with dismay . she stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not . suddenli she saw svidrigaïlov come quickli from the direct of the hay market . he seem to be approach cautious . he did not go on to the bridg , but stood asid on the pavement , do all he could to avoid raskolnikov ’ s see him . he had observ dounia for some time and had been make sign to her . she fanci he wa signal to beg her not to speak to her brother , but to come to him . that wa what dounia did . she stole by her brother and went up to svidrigaïlov . “ let us make hast away , ” svidrigaïlov whisper to her , “ i don ’ t want rodion romanovitch to know of our meet . i must tell you i ’ ve been sit with him in the restaur close by , where he look me up and i had great difficulti in get rid of him . he ha somehow heard of my letter to you and suspect someth . it wasn ’ t you who told him , of cours , but if not you , who then ? ” “ well , we ’ ve turn the corner now , ” dounia interrupt , “ and my brother won ’ t see us . i have to tell you that i am go no further with you . speak to me here . you can tell it all in the street. ” “ in the first place , i can ’ t say it in the street ; secondli , you must hear sofya semyonovna too ; and , thirdli , i will show you some paper .... oh well , if you won ’ t agre to come with me , i shall refus to give ani explan and go away at onc . but i beg you not to forget that a veri curiou secret of your belov brother ’ s is entir in my keeping. ” dounia stood still , hesit , and look at svidrigaïlov with search eye . “ what are you afraid of ? ” he observ quietli . “ the town is not the countri . and even in the countri you did me more harm than i did you. ” “ have you prepar sofya semyonovna ? ” “ no , i have not said a word to her and am not quit certain whether she is at home now . but most like she is . she ha buri her stepmoth to-day : she is not like to go visit on such a day . for the time i don ’ t want to speak to anyon about it and i half regret have spoken to you . the slightest indiscret is as bad as betray in a thing like thi . i live there in that hous , we are come to it . that ’ s the porter of our hous -- he know me veri well ; you see , he ’ s bow ; he see i ’ m come with a ladi and no doubt he ha notic your face alreadi and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspici . excus my put thing so coars . i haven ’ t a flat to myself ; sofya semyonovna ’ s room is next to mine -- she lodg in the next flat . the whole floor is let out in lodg . whi are you frighten like a child ? am i realli so terribl ? ” svidrigaïlov ’ s lip were twist in a condescend smile ; but he wa in no smile mood . hi heart wa throb and he could scarc breath . he spoke rather loud to cover hi grow excit . but dounia did not notic thi peculiar excit , she wa so irrit by hi remark that she wa frighten of him like a child and that he wa so terribl to her . “ though i know that you are not a man ... of honour , i am not in the least afraid of you . lead the way , ” she said with appar composur , but her face wa veri pale . svidrigaïlov stop at sonia ’ s room . “ allow me to inquir whether she is at home .... she is not . how unfortun ! but i know she may come quit soon . if she ’ s gone out , it can onli be to see a ladi about the orphan . their mother is dead .... i ’ ve been meddl and make arrang for them . if sofya semyonovna doe not come back in ten minut , i will send her to you , to-day if you like . thi is my flat . these are my two room . madam resslich , my landladi , ha the next room . now , look thi way . i will show you my chief piec of evid : thi door from my bedroom lead into two perfectli empti room , which are to let . here they are ... you must look into them with some attention. ” svidrigaïlov occupi two fairli larg furnish room . dounia wa look about her mistrust , but saw noth special in the furnitur or posit of the room . yet there wa someth to observ , for instanc , that svidrigaïlov ’ s flat wa exactli between two set of almost uninhabit apart . hi room were not enter directli from the passag , but through the landladi ’ s two almost empti room . unlock a door lead out of hi bedroom , svidrigaïlov show dounia the two empti room that were to let . dounia stop in the doorway , not know what she wa call to look upon , but svidrigaïlov hasten to explain . “ look here , at thi second larg room . notic that door , it ’ s lock . by the door stand a chair , the onli one in the two room . i brought it from my room so as to listen more conveni . just the other side of the door is sofya semyonovna ’ s tabl ; she sat there talk to rodion romanovitch . and i sat here listen on two success even , for two hour each time -- and of cours i wa abl to learn someth , what do you think ? ” “ you listen ? ” “ ye , i did . now come back to my room ; we can ’ t sit down here. ” he brought avdotya romanovna back into hi sitting-room and offer her a chair . he sat down at the opposit side of the tabl , at least seven feet from her , but probabl there wa the same glow in hi eye which had onc frighten dounia so much . she shudder and onc more look about her distrust . it wa an involuntari gestur ; she evid did not wish to betray her uneasi . but the seclud posit of svidrigaïlov ’ s lodg had suddenli struck her . she want to ask whether hi landladi at least were at home , but pride kept her from ask . moreov , she had anoth troubl in her heart incompar greater than fear for herself . she wa in great distress . “ here is your letter , ” she said , lay it on the tabl . “ can it be true what you write ? you hint at a crime commit , you say , by my brother . you hint at it too clearli ; you daren ’ t deni it now . i must tell you that i ’ d heard of thi stupid stori befor you wrote and don ’ t believ a word of it . it ’ s a disgust and ridicul suspicion . i know the stori and whi and how it wa invent . you can have no proof . you promis to prove it . speak ! but let me warn you that i don ’ t believ you ! i don ’ t believ you ! ” dounia said thi , speak hurriedli , and for an instant the colour rush to her face . “ if you didn ’ t believ it , how could you risk come alon to my room ? whi have you come ? simpli from curios ? ” “ don ’ t torment me . speak , speak ! ” “ there ’ s no deni that you are a brave girl . upon my word , i thought you would have ask mr. razumihin to escort you here . but he wa not with you nor anywher near . i wa on the look-out . it ’ s spirit of you , it prove you want to spare rodion romanovitch . but everyth is divin in you .... about your brother , what am i to say to you ? you ’ ve just seen him yourself . what did you think of him ? ” “ sure that ’ s not the onli thing you are build on ? ” “ no , not on that , but on hi own word . he came here on two success even to see sofya semyonovna . i ’ ve shown you where they sat . he made a full confess to her . he is a murder . he kill an old woman , a pawnbrok , with whom he had pawn thing himself . he kill her sister too , a pedlar woman call lizaveta , who happen to come in while he wa murder her sister . he kill them with an axe he brought with him . he murder them to rob them and he did rob them . he took money and variou thing .... he told all thi , word for word , to sofya semyonovna , the onli person who know hi secret . but she ha had no share by word or deed in the murder ; she wa as horrifi at it as you are now . don ’ t be anxiou , she won ’ t betray him. ” “ it can not be , ” mutter dounia , with white lip . she gasp for breath . “ it can not be . there wa not the slightest caus , no sort of ground .... it ’ s a lie , a lie ! ” “ he rob her , that wa the caus , he took money and thing . it ’ s true that by hi own admiss he made no use of the money or thing , but hid them under a stone , where they are now . but that wa becaus he dare not make use of them. ” “ but how could he steal , rob ? how could he dream of it ? ” cri dounia , and she jump up from the chair . “ whi , you know him , and you ’ ve seen him , can he be a thief ? ” she seem to be implor svidrigaïlov ; she had entir forgotten her fear . “ there are thousand and million of combin and possibl , avdotya romanovna . a thief steal and know he is a scoundrel , but i ’ ve heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail . who know , veri like he thought he wa do a gentlemanli thing ! of cours i should not have believ it myself if i ’ d been told of it as you have , but i believ my own ear . he explain all the caus of it to sofya semyonovna too , but she did not believ her ear at first , yet she believ her own eye at last. ” “ what ... were the caus ? ” “ it ’ s a long stori , avdotya romanovna . here ’ s ... how shall i tell you ? -- a theori of a sort , the same one by which i for instanc consid that a singl misde is permiss if the princip aim is right , a solitari wrongdo and hundr of good deed ! it ’ s gall too , of cours , for a young man of gift and overween pride to know that if he had , for instanc , a paltri three thousand , hi whole career , hi whole futur would be differ shape and yet not to have that three thousand . add to that , nervou irrit from hunger , from lodg in a hole , from rag , from a vivid sens of the charm of hi social posit and hi sister ’ s and mother ’ s posit too . abov all , vaniti , pride and vaniti , though good know he may have good qualiti too .... i am not blame him , pleas don ’ t think it ; besid , it ’ s not my busi . a special littl theori came in too -- a theori of a sort -- divid mankind , you see , into materi and superior person , that is person to whom the law doe not appli owe to their superior , who make law for the rest of mankind , the materi , that is . it ’ s all right as a theori , _une théori comm une autre_ . napoleon attract him tremend , that is , what affect him wa that a great mani men of geniu have not hesit at wrongdo , but have overstep the law without think about it . he seem to have fanci that he wa a geniu too -- that is , he wa convinc of it for a time . he ha suffer a great deal and is still suffer from the idea that he could make a theori , but wa incap of boldli overstep the law , and so he is not a man of geniu . and that ’ s humili for a young man of ani pride , in our day especi .... ” “ but remors ? you deni him ani moral feel then ? is he like that ? ” “ ah , avdotya romanovna , everyth is in a muddl now ; not that it wa ever in veri good order . russian in gener are broad in their idea , avdotya romanovna , broad like their land and exceedingli dispos to the fantast , the chaotic . but it ’ s a misfortun to be broad without a special geniu . do you rememb what a lot of talk we had togeth on thi subject , sit in the even on the terrac after supper ? whi , you use to reproach me with breadth ! who know , perhap we were talk at the veri time when he wa lie here think over hi plan . there are no sacr tradit amongst us , especi in the educ class , avdotya romanovna . at the best someon will make them up somehow for himself out of book or from some old chronicl . but those are for the most part the learn and all old fogey , so that it would be almost ill-br in a man of societi . you know my opinion in gener , though . i never blame anyon . i do noth at all , i persever in that . but we ’ ve talk of thi more than onc befor . i wa so happi inde as to interest you in my opinion .... you are veri pale , avdotya romanovna. ” “ i know hi theori . i read that articl of hi about men to whom all is permit . razumihin brought it to me. ” “ mr . razumihin ? your brother ’ s articl ? in a magazin ? is there such an articl ? i didn ’ t know . it must be interest . but where are you go , avdotya romanovna ? ” “ i want to see sofya semyonovna , ” dounia articul faintli . “ how do i go to her ? she ha come in , perhap . i must see her at onc . perhap she ... ” avdotya romanovna could not finish . her breath liter fail her . “ sofya semyonovna will not be back till night , at least i believ not . she wa to have been back at onc , but if not , then she will not be in till quit late. ” “ ah , then you are lie ! i see ... you were lie ... lie all the time .... i don ’ t believ you ! i don ’ t believ you ! ” cri dounia , complet lose her head . almost faint , she sank on to a chair which

such thing , ” he smile . “ i know you will shoot , you pretti wild creatur . well , shoot away ! ” dounia rais the revolv , and deadli pale , gaze at him , measur the distanc and await the first movement on hi part . her lower lip wa white and quiver and her big black eye flash like fire . he had never seen her so handsom . the fire glow in her eye at the moment she rais the revolv seem to kindl him and there wa a pang of anguish in hi heart . he took a step forward and a shot rang out . the bullet graze hi hair and flew into the wall behind . he stood still and laugh softli . “ the wasp ha stung me . she aim straight at my head . what ’ s thi ? blood ? ” he pull out hi handkerchief to wipe the blood , which flow in a thin stream down hi right templ . the bullet seem to have just graze the skin . dounia lower the revolv and look at svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amaz . she seem not to understand what she wa do and what wa go on . “ well , you miss !

kill him , at two pace ! ” suddenli she flung away the revolv . “ she ’ s drop it ! ” said svidrigaïlov with surpris , and he drew a deep breath . a weight seem to have roll from hi heart -- perhap not onli the fear of death ; inde he may scarc have felt it at that moment . it wa the deliver from anoth feel , darker and more bitter , which he could not himself have defin . he went to dounia and gentli put hi arm round her waist . she did not resist , but , trembl like a leaf , look at him with suppliant eye . he tri to say someth , but hi lip move without be abl to utter a sound . “ let me go , ” dounia implor . svidrigaïlov shudder . her voic now wa quit differ . “ then you don ’ t love me ? ” he ask softli . dounia shook her head . “ and ... and you can ’ t ? never ? ” he whisper in despair . “ never ! ” there follow a moment of terribl , dumb struggl in the heart of svidrigaïlov . he look at her with an indescrib gaze . suddenli he withdrew hi arm , turn quickli to the window and stood face it . anoth moment pass . “ here ’ s the key. ” he took it out of the left pocket of hi coat and laid it on the tabl behind him , without turn or look at dounia . “ take it ! make hast ! ” he look stubbornli out of the window . dounia went up to the tabl to take the key . “ make hast ! make hast ! ” repeat svidrigaïlov , still without turn or move . but there seem a terribl signific in the tone of that “ make haste. ” dounia understood it , snatch up the key , flew to the door , unlock it quickli and rush out of the room . a minut later , besid herself , she ran out on to the canal bank in the direct of x. bridg . svidrigaïlov remain three minut stand at the window . at last he slowli turn , look about him and pass hi hand over hi forehead . a strang smile contort hi face , a piti , sad , weak smile , a smile of despair . the blood , which wa alreadi get dri , smear hi hand . he look angrili at it , then wet a towel and wash hi templ . the revolv which dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenli caught hi eye . he pick it up and examin it . it wa a littl pocket three-barrel revolv of old-fashion construct . there were still two charg and one capsul left in it . it could be fire again . he thought a littl , put the revolv in hi pocket , took hi hat and went out . chapter vi he spent that even till ten o ’ clock go from one low haunt to anoth . katia too turn up and sang anoth gutter song , how a certain “ villain and tyrant , ” “ began kiss katia. ” svidrigaïlov treat katia and the organ-grind and some singer and the waiter and two littl clerk . he wa particularli drawn to these clerk by the fact that they both had crook nose , one bent to the left and the other to the right . they took him final to a pleasur garden , where he paid for their entranc . there wa one lanki three-year-old pine-tre and three bush in the garden , besid a “ vauxhal , ” which wa in realiti a drinking-bar where tea too wa serv , and there were a few green tabl and chair stand round it . a choru of wretch singer and a drunken but exceedingli depress german clown from munich with a red nose entertain the public . the clerk quarrel with some other clerk and a fight seem immin . svidrigaïlov wa chosen to decid the disput . he listen to them for a quarter of an hour , but they shout so loud that there wa no possibl of understand them . the onli fact that seem certain wa that one of them had stolen someth and had even succeed in sell it on the spot to a jew , but would not share the spoil with hi companion . final it appear that the stolen object wa a teaspoon belong to the vauxhal . it wa miss and the affair began to seem troublesom . svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon , got up , and walk out of the garden . it wa about six o ’ clock . he had not drunk a drop of wine all thi time and had order tea more for the sake of appear than anyth . it wa a dark and stifl even . threaten storm-cloud came over the sky about ten o ’ clock . there wa a clap of thunder , and the rain came down like a waterfal . the water fell not in drop , but beat on the earth in stream . there were flash of lightn everi minut and each flash last while one could count five . drench to the skin , he went home , lock himself in , open the bureau , took out all hi money and tore up two or three paper . then , put the money in hi pocket , he wa about to chang hi cloth , but , look out of the window and listen to the thunder and the rain , he gave up the idea , took up hi hat and went out of the room without lock the door . he went straight to sonia . she wa at home . she wa not alon : the four kapernaumov children were with her . she wa give them tea . she receiv svidrigaïlov in respect silenc , look wonderingli at hi soak cloth . the children all ran away at onc in indescrib terror . svidrigaïlov sat down at the tabl and ask sonia to sit besid him . she timidli prepar to listen . “ i may be go to america , sofya semyonovna , ” said svidrigaïlov , “ and as i am probabl see you for the last time , i have come to make some arrang . well , did you see the ladi to-day ? i know what she said to you , you need not tell me. ” ( sonia made a movement and blush . ) “ those peopl have their own way of do thing . as to your sister and your brother , they are realli provid for and the money assign to them i ’ ve put into safe keep and have receiv acknowledg . you had better take charg of the receipt , in case anyth happen . here , take them ! well now , that ’ s settl . here are three 5-per-cent bond to the valu of three thousand roubl . take those for

is bad , and besid there is no need for it now. ” “ i am so much indebt to you , and so are the children and my stepmoth , ” said sonia hurriedli , “ and if i ’ ve said so littl ... pleas don ’ t consid ... ” “ that ’ s enough ! that ’ s enough ! ” “ but as for the money , arkadi ivanovitch , i am veri grate to you , but i don ’ t need it now . i can alway earn my own live . don ’ t think me ungrat . if you are so charit , that money .... ” “ it ’ s for you , for you , sofya semyonovna , and pleas don ’ t wast word over it . i haven ’ t time for it . you will want it . rodion romanovitch ha two altern : a bullet in the brain or siberia. ” ( sonia look wildli at him , and start . ) “ don ’ t be uneasi , i know all about it from himself and i am not a gossip ; i won ’ t tell anyon . it wa good advic when you told him to give himself up and confess . it would be much better for him . well , if it turn out to be siberia , he will go and you will follow him . that ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? and if so , you ’ ll need money . you ’ ll need it for him , do you understand ? give it to you is the same as my give it to him . besid , you promis amalia ivanovna to pay what ’ s owe . i heard you

razumihin ? of cours you do . he ’ s not a bad fellow . take it to him to-morrow or ... when the time come . and till then , hide it carefully. ” sonia too jump up from her chair and look in dismay at svidrigaïlov . she long to speak , to ask a question , but for the first moment she did not dare and did not know how to begin . “ how can you ... how can you be go now , in such rain ? ” “ whi , be start for america , and be stop by rain ! ha , ha ! good-by , sofya semyonovna , my dear ! live and live long , you will be of use to other . by the way ... tell mr. razumihin i send my greet to him . tell him arkadi ivanovitch svidrigaïlov send hi greet . be sure to. ” he went out , leav sonia in a state of wonder anxieti and vagu apprehens . it appear afterward that on the same even , at twenti past eleven , he made anoth veri eccentr and unexpect visit . the rain still persist . drench to the skin , he walk into the littl flat where the parent of hi betroth live , in third street in vassilyevski island . he knock some time befor he wa admit , and hi visit at first caus great perturb ; but svidrigaïlov could be veri fascin when he like , so that the first , and inde veri intellig surmis of the sensibl parent that svidrigaïlov had probabl had so much to drink that he did not know what he wa do vanish immedi . the decrepit father wa wheel in to see svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensibl mother , who as usual began the convers with variou irrelev question . she never ask a direct question , but began by smile and rub her hand and then , if she were oblig to ascertain someth -- for instanc , when svidrigaïlov would like to have the wed -- she would begin by interest and almost eager question about pari and the court life there , and onli by degre brought the convers round to third street . on other occas thi had of cours been veri impress , but thi time arkadi ivanovitch seem particularli impati , and insist on see hi betroth at onc , though he had been inform , to begin with , that she had alreadi gone to bed . the girl of cours appear . svidrigaïlov inform her at onc that he wa oblig by veri import affair to leav petersburg for a time , and therefor brought her fifteen thousand roubl and beg her accept them as a present from him , as he had long been intend to make her thi trifl present befor their wed . the logic connect of the present with hi immedi departur and the absolut necess of visit them for that purpos in pour rain at midnight wa not made clear . but it all went off veri well ; even the inevit ejacul of wonder and regret , the inevit question were extraordinarili few and restrain . on the other hand , the gratitud express wa most glow and wa reinforc by tear from the most sensibl of mother . svidrigaïlov got up , laugh , kiss hi betroth , pat her cheek , declar he would soon come back , and notic in her eye , togeth with childish curios , a sort of earnest dumb inquiri , reflect and kiss her again , though he felt sincer anger inwardli at the thought that hi present would be immedi lock up in the keep of the most sensibl of mother . he went away , leav them all in a state of extraordinari excit , but the tender mamma , speak quietli in a half whisper , settl some of the most import of their doubt , conclud that svidrigaïlov wa a great man , a man of great affair and connect and of great wealth -- there wa no know what he had in hi mind . he would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fanci took him , so that there wa noth surpris about it . of cours it wa strang that he wa wet through , but englishmen , for instanc , are even more eccentr , and all these peopl of high societi didn ’ t think of what wa said of them and didn ’ t stand on ceremoni . possibl , inde , he came like that on purpos to show that he wa not afraid of anyon . abov all , not a word should be said about it , for god know what might come of it , and the money must be lock up , and it wa most fortun that fedosya , the cook , had not left the kitchen . and abov all not a word must be said to that old cat , madam resslich , and so on and so on . they sat up whisper till two o ’ clock , but the girl went to bed much earlier , amaz and rather sorrow . svidrigaïlov meanwhil , exactli at midnight , cross the bridg on the way back to the mainland . the rain had ceas and there wa a roar wind . he began shiver , and for one moment he gaze at the black water of the littl neva with a look of special interest , even inquiri . but he soon felt it veri cold , stand by the water ; he turn and went toward y . prospect . he walk along that endless street for a long time , almost half an hour , more than onc stumbl in the dark on the wooden pavement , but continu look for someth on the right side of the street . he had notic pass through thi street late that there wa a hotel somewher toward the end , built of wood , but fairli larg , and it name he rememb wa someth like adrianopl . he wa not mistaken : the hotel wa so conspicu in that god-forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark . it wa a long , blacken wooden build , and in spite of the late hour there were light in the window and sign of life within . he went in and ask a rag fellow who met him in the corridor for a room . the latter , scan svidrigaïlov , pull himself togeth and led him at onc to a close and tini room in the distanc , at the end of the corridor , under the stair . there wa no other , all were occupi . the rag fellow look inquiringli . “ is there tea ? ” ask svidrigaïlov . “ ye , sir. ” “ what els is there ? ” “ veal , vodka , savouries. ” “ bring me tea and veal. ” “ and you want noth els ? ” he ask with appar surpris . “ noth , nothing. ” the rag man went away , complet disillus . “ it must be a nice place , ” thought svidrigaïlov . “ how wa it i didn ’ t know it ? i expect i look as if i came from a café chantant and have had some adventur on the way . it would be interest to know who stay here ? ” he light the candl and look at the room more care . it wa a room so low-pitch that svidrigaïlov could onli just stand up in it ; it had one window ; the bed , which wa veri dirti , and the plain-stain chair and tabl almost fill it up . the wall look as though they were made of plank , cover with shabbi paper , so torn and dusti that the pattern wa indistinguish , though the gener colour -- yellow -- could still be made out . one of the wall wa cut short by the slope ceil , though the room wa not an attic but just under the stair . svidrigaïlov set down the candl , sat down on the bed and sank into thought . but a strang persist murmur which sometim rose to a shout in the next room attract hi attent . the murmur had not ceas from the moment he enter the room . he listen : someon wa upbraid and almost tear scold , but he heard onli one voic . svidrigaïlov got up , shade the light with hi hand and at onc he saw light through a crack in the wall ; he went up and peep through . the room , which wa somewhat larger than hi , had two occup . one of them , a veri curly-head man with a red inflam face , wa stand in the pose of an orat , without hi coat , with hi leg wide apart to preserv hi balanc , and smite himself on the breast . he reproach the other with be a beggar , with have no stand whatev . he declar that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he like , and that onli the finger of provid see it all . the object of hi reproach wa sit in a chair , and had the air of a man who want dread to sneez , but can ’ t . he sometim turn sheepish and befog eye on the speaker , but obvious had not the slightest idea what he wa talk about and scarc heard it . a candl wa burn down on the tabl ; there were wine-glass , a nearli empti bottl of vodka , bread and cucumb , and glass with the dreg of stale tea . after gaze attent at thi , svidrigaïlov turn away indiffer and sat down on the bed . the rag attend , return with the tea , could not resist ask him again whether he didn ’ t want anyth more , and again receiv a neg repli , final withdrew . svidrigaïlov made hast to drink a glass of tea to warm himself , but could not eat anyth . he began to feel feverish . he took off hi coat and , wrap himself in the blanket , lay down on the bed . he wa annoy . “ it would have been better to be well for the occas , ” he thought with a smile . the room wa close , the candl burnt dimli , the wind wa roar outsid , he heard a mous scratch in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather . he lay in a sort of reveri : one thought follow anoth . he felt a long to fix hi imagin on someth . “ it must be a garden under the window , ” he thought . “ there ’ s a sound of tree . how i dislik the sound of tree on a stormi night , in the dark ! they give one a horrid feeling. ” he rememb how he had dislik it when he pass petrovski park just now . thi remind him of the bridg over the littl neva and he felt cold again as he had when stand there . “ i never have like water , ” he thought , “ even in a landscap , ” and he suddenli smile again at a strang idea : “ sure now all these question of tast and comfort ought not to matter , but i ’ ve becom more particular , like an anim that pick out a special place ... for such an occas . i ought to have gone into the petrovski park ! i suppos it seem dark , cold , ha-ha ! as though i were seek pleasant sensat ! ... by the way , whi haven ’ t i put out the candl ? ” he blew it out . “ they ’ ve gone to bed next door , ” he thought , not see the light at the crack . “ well , now , marfa petrovna , now is the time for you to turn up ; it ’ s dark , and the veri time and place for you . but now you won ’ t come ! ” he suddenli recal how , an hour befor carri out hi design on dounia , he had recommend raskolnikov to trust her to razumihin ’ s keep . “ i suppos i realli did say it , as raskolnikov guess , to teas myself . but what a rogu that raskolnikov is ! he ’ s gone through a good deal . he may be a success rogu in time when he ’ s got over hi nonsens . but now he ’ s _too_ eager for life . these young men are contempt on that point . but , hang the fellow ! let him pleas himself , it ’ s noth to do with me. ” he could not get to sleep . by degre dounia ’ s imag rose befor him , and a shudder ran over him . “ no , i must give up all that now , ” he thought , rous himself . “ i must think of someth els . it ’ s queer and funni . i never had a great hatr for anyon , i never particularli desir to aveng myself even , and that ’ s a bad sign , a bad sign , a bad sign . i never like quarrel either , and never lost my temper -- that ’ s a bad sign too . and the promis i made her just now , too -- damnat ! but -- who know ? -- perhap she would have made a new man of me somehow .... ” he ground hi teeth and sank into silenc again . again dounia ’ s imag rose befor him , just as she wa when , after shoot the first time , she had lower the revolv in terror and gaze blankli at him , so that he might have seiz her twice over and she would not have lift a hand to defend herself if he had not remind her . he recal how at that instant he felt almost sorri for her , how he had felt a pang at hi heart ... “ aïe ! damnat , these thought again ! i must put it away ! ” he wa doze off ; the feverish shiver had ceas , when suddenli someth seem to run over hi arm and leg under the bedcloth . he start . “ ugh ! hang it ! i believ it ’ s a mous , ” he thought , “ that ’ s the veal i left on the table. ” he felt fear disinclin to pull off the blanket , get up , get cold , but all at onc someth unpleas ran over hi leg again . he pull off the blanket and light the candl . shake with feverish chill he bent down to examin the bed : there wa noth . he shook the blanket and suddenli a mous jump out on the sheet . he tri to catch it , but the mous ran to and fro in zigzag without leav the bed , slip between hi finger , ran over hi hand and suddenli dart under the pillow . he threw down the pillow , but in one instant felt someth leap on hi chest and dart over hi bodi and down hi back under hi shirt . he trembl nervous and woke up . the room wa dark . he wa lie on the bed and wrap up in the blanket as befor . the wind wa howl under the window . “ how disgust , ” he thought with annoy . he got up and sat on the edg of the bedstead with hi back to the window . “ it ’ s better not to sleep at all , ” he decid . there wa a cold damp draught from the window , howev ; without get up he drew the blanket over him and wrap himself in it . he wa not think of anyth and did not want to think . but one imag rose after anoth , incoher scrap of thought without begin or end pass through hi mind . he sank into drowsi . perhap the cold , or the damp , or the dark , or the wind that howl under the window and toss the tree rous a sort of persist crave for the fantast . he kept dwell on imag of flower , he fanci a charm flower garden , a bright , warm , almost hot day , a holiday -- triniti day . a fine , sumptuou countri cottag in the english tast overgrown with fragrant flower , with flower bed go round the hous ; the porch , wreath in climber , wa surround with bed of rose . a light , cool staircas , carpet with rich rug , wa decor with rare plant in china pot . he notic particularli in the window nosegay of tender , white , heavili fragrant narcissu bend over their bright , green , thick long stalk . he wa reluct to move away from them , but he went up the stair and came into a larg , high drawing-room and again everywher -- at the window , the door on to the balconi , and on the balconi itself -- were flower . the floor were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay , the window were open , a fresh , cool , light air came into the room . the bird were chirrup under the window , and in the middl of the room , on a tabl cover with a white satin shroud , stood a coffin . the coffin wa cover with white silk and edg with a thick white frill ; wreath of flower surround it on all side . among the flower lay a girl in a white muslin dress , with her arm cross and press on her bosom , as though carv out of marbl . but her loos fair hair wa wet ; there wa a wreath of rose on her head . the stern and alreadi rigid profil of her face look as though chisel of marbl too , and the smile on her pale lip wa full of an immens unchildish miseri and sorrow appeal . svidrigaïlov knew that girl ; there wa no holi imag , no burn candl besid the coffin ; no sound of prayer : the girl had drown herself . she wa onli fourteen , but her heart wa broken . and she had destroy herself , crush by an insult that had appal and amaz that childish soul , had smirch that angel puriti with unmerit disgrac and torn from her a last scream of despair , unheed and brutal disregard , on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howl .... svidrigaïlov came to himself , got up from the bed and went to the window . he felt for the latch and open it . the wind lash furious into the littl room and stung hi face and hi chest , onli cover with hi shirt , as though with frost . under the window there must have been someth like a garden , and appar a pleasur garden . there , too , probabl there were tea-tabl and sing in the daytim . now drop of rain flew in at the window from the tree and bush ; it wa dark as in a cellar , so that he could onli just make out some dark blur of object . svidrigaïlov , bend down with elbow on the window-sil , gaze for five minut into the dark ; the boom of a cannon , follow by a second one , resound in the dark of the night . “ ah , the signal ! the river is overflow , ” he thought . “ by morn it will be swirl down the street in the lower part , flood the basement and cellar . the cellar rat will swim out , and men will curs in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storey . what time is it now ? ” and he had hardli thought it when , somewher near , a clock on the wall , tick away hurriedli , struck three . “ aha ! it will be light in an hour ! whi wait ? i ’ ll go out at onc straight to the park . i ’ ll choos a great bush there drench with rain , so that as soon as one ’ s shoulder touch it , million of drop drip on one ’ s head. ” he move away from the window , shut it , light the candl , put on hi waistcoat , hi overcoat and hi hat and went out , carri the candl , into the passag to look for the rag attend who would be asleep somewher in the midst of candle-end and all sort of rubbish , to pay him for the room and leav the hotel . “ it ’ s the best minut ; i couldn ’ t choos a better. ” he walk for some time through a long narrow corridor without find anyon and wa just go to call out , when suddenli in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strang object which seem to be aliv . he bent down with the candl and saw a littl girl , not more than five year old , shiver and cri , with her cloth as wet as a soak house-flannel . she did not seem afraid of svidrigaïlov , but look at him with blank amaz out of her big black eye . now and then she sob as children do when they have been cri a long time , but are begin to be comfort . the child ’ s face wa pale and tire , she wa numb with cold . “ how can she have come here ? she must have hidden here and not slept all night. ” he began question her . the child suddenli becom anim , chatter away in her babi languag , someth about “ mammi ” and that “ mammi would beat her , ” and about some cup that she had “ bwoken. ” the child chatter on without stop . he could onli guess from what she said that she wa a neglect child , whose mother , probabl a drunken cook , in the servic of the hotel , whip and frighten her ; that the child had broken a cup of her mother ’ s and wa so frighten that she had run away the even befor , had hidden for a long while somewher outsid in the rain , at last had made her way in here , hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there , cri and trembl from the damp , the dark and the fear that she would be badli beaten for it . he took her in hi arm , went back to hi room , sat her on the bed , and began undress her . the torn shoe which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been stand in a puddl all night . when he had undress her , he put her on the bed , cover her up and wrap her in the blanket from her head downward . she fell asleep at onc . then he sank into dreari muse again . “ what folli to troubl myself , ” he decid suddenli with an oppress feel of annoy . “ what idioci ! ” in vexat he took up the candl to go and look for the rag attend again and make hast to go away . “ damn the child ! ” he thought as he open the door , but he turn again to see whether the child wa asleep . he rais the blanket care . the child wa sleep soundli , she had got warm under the blanket , and her pale cheek were flush . but strang to say that flush seem brighter and coarser than the rosi cheek of childhood . “ it ’ s a flush of fever , ” thought svidrigaïlov . it wa like the flush from drink , as though she had been given a full glass to drink . her crimson lip were hot and glow ; but what wa thi ? he suddenli fanci that her long black eyelash were quiver , as though the lid were open and a sli crafti eye peep out with an unchildlik wink , as though the littl girl were not asleep , but pretend . ye , it wa so . her lip part in a smile . the corner of her mouth quiver , as though she were tri to control them . but now she quit gave up all effort , now it wa a grin , a broad grin ; there wa someth shameless , provoc in that quit unchildish face ; it wa deprav , it wa the face of a harlot , the shameless face of a french harlot . now both eye open wide ; they turn a glow , shameless glanc upon him ; they laugh , invit him .... there wa someth infinit hideou and shock in that laugh , in those eye , in such nasti in the face of a child . “ what , at five year old ? ” svidrigaïlov mutter in genuin horror . “ what doe it mean ? ” and now she turn to him , her littl face all aglow , hold out her arm .... “ accurs child ! ” svidrigaïlov cri , rais hi hand to strike her , but at that moment he woke up . he wa in the same bed , still wrap in the blanket . the candl had not been light , and daylight wa stream in at the window . “ i ’ ve had nightmar all night ! ” he got up angrili , feel utterli shatter ; hi bone ach . there wa a thick mist outsid and he could see noth . it wa nearli five . he had overslept himself ! he got up , put on hi still damp jacket and overcoat . feel the revolv in hi pocket , he took it out and then he sat down , took a notebook out of hi pocket and in the most conspicu place on the titl page wrote a few line in larg letter . read them over , he sank into thought with hi elbow on the tabl . the revolv and the notebook lay besid him . some fli woke up and settl on the untouch veal , which wa still on the tabl . he stare at them and at last with hi free right hand began tri to catch one . he tri till he wa tire , but could not catch it . at last , realis that he wa engag in thi interest pursuit , he start , got up and walk resolut out of the room . a minut later he wa in the street . a thick milki mist hung over the town . svidrigaïlov walk along the slipperi dirti wooden pavement toward the littl neva . he wa pictur the water of the littl neva swollen in the night , petrovski island , the wet path , the wet grass , the wet tree and bush and at last the bush .... he began ill-humouredli stare at the hous , tri to think of someth els . there wa not a cabman or a passer-bi in the street . the bright yellow , wooden , littl hous look dirti and deject with their close shutter . the cold and damp penetr hi whole bodi and he began to shiver . from time to time he came across shop sign and read each care . at last he reach the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone hous . a dirti , shiver dog cross hi path with it tail between it leg . a man in a greatcoat lay face downward ; dead drunk , across the pavement . he look at him and went on . a high tower stood up on the left . “ bah ! ” he shout , “ here is a place . whi should it be petrovski ? it will be in the presenc of an offici wit anyway .... ” he almost smile at thi new thought and turn into the street where there wa the big hous with the tower . at the great close gate of the hous , a littl man stood with hi shoulder lean against them , wrap in a grey soldier ’ s coat , with a copper achil helmet on hi head . he cast a drowsi and indiffer glanc at svidrigaïlov . hi face wore that perpetu look of peevish deject , which is so sourli print on all face of jewish race without except . they both , svidrigaïlov and achil , stare at each other for a few minut without speak . at last it struck achil as irregular for a man not drunk to be stand three step from him , stare and not say a word . “ what do you want here ? ” he said , without move or chang hi posit . “ noth , brother , good morn , ” answer svidrigaïlov . “ thi isn ’ t the place. ” “ i am go to foreign part , brother. ” “ to foreign part ? ” “ to america. ” “ america. ” svidrigaïlov took out the revolv and cock it . achil rais hi eyebrow . “ i say , thi is not the place for such joke ! ” “ whi shouldn ’ t it be the place ? ” “ becaus it isn ’ t. ” “ well , brother , i don ’ t mind that . it ’ s a good place . when you are ask , you just say he wa go , he said , to america. ” he put the revolv to hi right templ . “ you can ’ t do it here , it ’ s not the place , ” cri achil , rous himself , hi eye grow bigger and bigger . svidrigaïlov pull the trigger . chapter vii the same day , about seven o ’ clock in the even , raskolnikov wa on hi way to hi mother ’ s and sister ’ s lodg -- the lodg in bakaleyev ’ s hous which razumihin had found for them . the stair went up from the street . raskolnikov walk with lag step , as though still hesit whether to go or not . but noth would have turn him back : hi decis wa taken . “ besid , it doesn ’ t matter , they still know noth , ” he thought , “ and they are use to think of me as eccentric. ” he wa appallingli dress : hi cloth torn and dirti , soak with a night ’ s rain . hi face wa almost distort from fatigu , exposur , the inward conflict that had last for twenty-four hour . he had spent all the previou night alon , god know where . but anyway he had reach a decis . he knock at the door which wa open by hi mother . dounia wa not at home . even the servant happen to be out . at first pulcheria alexandrovna wa speechless with joy and surpris ; then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room . “ here you are ! ” she began , falter with joy . “ don ’ t be angri with me , rodya , for welcom you so foolishli with tear : i am laugh not cri . did you think i wa cri ? no , i am delight , but i ’ ve got into such a stupid habit of shed tear . i ’ ve been like that ever sinc your father ’ s death . i cri for anyth . sit down , dear boy , you must be tire ; i see you are . ah , how muddi you are. ” “ i wa in the rain yesterday , mother .... ” raskolnikov began . “ no , no , ” pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedli interrupt , “ you thought i wa go to cross-quest you in the womanish way i use to ; don ’ t be anxiou , i understand , i understand it all : now i ’ ve learn the way here and truli i see for myself that they are better . i ’ ve made up my mind onc for all : how could i understand your plan and expect you to give an account of them ? god know what concern and plan you may have , or what idea you are hatch ; so it ’ s not for me to keep nudg your elbow , ask you what you are think about ? but

he is think them over and i worri him and upset him. ’ i read it , my dear , and of cours there wa a great deal i did not understand ; but that ’ s onli natur -- how should i ? ” “ show me , mother. ” raskolnikov took the magazin and glanc at hi articl . incongru as it wa with hi mood and hi circumst , he felt that strang and bitter sweet sensat that everi author experi the first time he see himself in print ; besid , he wa onli twenty-thre . it last onli a moment . after read a few line he frown and hi heart throb with anguish . he recal all the inward conflict of the preced month . he flung the articl on the tabl with disgust and anger . “ but , howev foolish i may be , rodya , i can see for myself that you will veri soon be one of the lead -- if not the lead man -- in the world of russian thought . and they dare to think you were mad ! you don ’ t know , but they realli thought that . ah , the despic creatur , how could they understand geniu ! and dounia , dounia wa all but believ it -- what do you say to that ? your father sent twice to magazin -- the first time poem ( i ’ ve got the manuscript and will show you ) and the second time a whole novel ( i beg him to let me copi it out ) and how we pray that they should be taken -- they weren ’ t ! i wa break my heart , rodya , six or seven day ago over your food and your cloth and the way you are live . but now i see again how foolish i wa , for you can attain ani posit you like by your intellect and talent . no doubt you don ’ t care about that for the present and you are occupi with much more import matter .... ” “ dounia ’ s not at home , mother ? ” “ no , rodya . i often don ’ t see her ; she leav me alon . dmitri prokofitch come to see me , it ’ s so good of him , and he alway talk about you . he love you

about you from everyon , and sometim you ’ ll come yourself to see me . what could be better ? here you ’ ve come now to comfort your mother , i see that. ” here pulcheria alexandrovna began to cri . “ here i am again ! don ’ t mind my foolish . my good , whi am i sit here ? ” she cri , jump up . “ there is coffe and i don ’ t offer you ani . ah , that ’ s the selfish of old age . i ’ ll get it at

the matter ? how can you ask me such a question ? whi , who will tell me anyth about you ? besid , i shouldn ’ t believ anyon , i should refus to listen. ” “ i ’ ve come to assur you that i ’ ve alway love you and i am glad that we are alon , even glad dounia is out , ” he went on with the same impuls . “ i have come to tell you that though you will be unhappi , you must believ that your son love

a daughter even ... dmitri prokofitch will help us to go togeth . but ... where ... are you go ? ” “ good-by , mother. ” “ what , to-day ? ” she cri , as though lose him for ever . “ i can ’ t stay , i must go now .... ” “ and can ’ t i come with you ? ” “ no , but kneel down and pray to god for me . your prayer perhap will reach him. ” “ let me bless you and sign you with the cross . that ’ s right , that ’ s right . oh , god , what are we do ? ” ye , he wa glad , he wa veri glad that there wa no one there , that he wa alon with hi mother . for the first time after all those aw month hi heart wa soften . he fell down befor her , he kiss her feet and both wept , embrac . and she wa not surpris and did not question him thi time . for some day she had realis that someth aw wa happen to her son and that now some terribl minut had come for him . “ rodya , my darl , my first born , ” she said sob , “ now you are just as when you were littl . you would run like thi to me and hug me and kiss me . when your father wa live and we were poor , you comfort us simpli by be with us and when i buri your father , how often we wept togeth at hi grave and embrac , as now . and if i ’ ve been cri late , it ’ s that my mother ’ s heart had a forebod of troubl . the first time i saw you , that even , you rememb , as soon as we arriv here , i guess simpli from your eye . my heart sank at onc , and to-day when i open the door and look at you , i thought the fatal hour had come . rodya , rodya , you are not go away to-day ? ” “ no ! ” “ you ’ ll come again ? ” “ ye ... i ’ ll come. ” “ rodya , don ’ t be angri , i don ’ t dare to question you . i know i mustn ’ t . onli say two word to me -- is it far where you are go ? ” “ veri far. ” “ what is await you there ? some post or career for you ? ” “ what god send ... onli pray for me. ” raskolnikov went to the door , but she clutch him and gaze despairingli into hi eye . her face work with terror . “ enough , mother , ” said raskolnikov , deepli regret that he had come . “ not for ever , it ’ s not yet for ever ? you ’ ll come , you ’ ll come to-morrow ? ” “ i will , i will , good-bye. ” he tore himself away at last . it wa a warm , fresh , bright even ; it had clear up in the morn . raskolnikov went to hi lodg ; he made hast . he want to finish all befor sunset . he did not want to meet anyon till then . go up the stair he notic that nastasya rush from the samovar to watch him intent . “ can anyon have come to see me ? ” he wonder . he had a disgust vision of porfiri . but open hi door he saw dounia . she wa sit alon , plung in deep thought , and look as though she had been wait a long time . he stop short in the doorway . she rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up face him . her eye , fix upon him , betray horror and infinit grief . and from those eye alon he saw at onc that she knew . “ am i to come in or go away ? ” he ask uncertainli . “ i ’ ve been all day with sofya semyonovna . we were both wait for you . we thought that you would be sure to come there. ” raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhaust on a chair . “ i feel weak , dounia , i am veri tire ; and i should have like at thi moment to be abl to control myself. ” he glanc at her mistrust . “ where were you all night ? ” “ i don ’ t rememb clearli . you see , sister , i want to make up my mind onc for all , and sever time i walk by the neva , i rememb that i want to end it all there , but ... i couldn ’ t make up my mind , ” he whisper , look at her mistrust again . “ thank god ! that wa just what we were afraid of , sofya semyonovna and i . then you still have faith in life ? thank god , thank god ! ” raskolnikov smile bitterli . “ i haven ’ t faith , but i have just been weep in mother ’ s arm ; i haven ’ t faith , but i have just ask her to pray for me . i don ’ t know how it is , dounia , i don ’ t understand it. ” “ have you been at mother ’ s ? have you told her ? ” cri dounia , horror-stricken . “ sure you haven ’ t done that ? ” “ no , i didn ’ t tell her ... in word ; but she understood a great deal . she heard you talk in your sleep . i am sure she half understand it alreadi . perhap i did wrong in go to see her . i don ’ t know whi i did go . i am a contempt person , dounia. ” “ a contempt person , but readi to face suffer ! you are , aren ’ t you ? ” “ ye , i am go . at onc . ye , to escap the disgrac i thought of drown myself , dounia , but as i look into the water , i thought that if i had consid myself strong till now i ’ d better not be afraid of disgrac , ” he said , hurri on . “ it ’ s pride , dounia. ” “ pride , rodya. ” there wa a gleam of fire in hi lustreless eye ; he seem to be glad to think that he wa still proud . “ you don ’ t think , sister , that i wa simpli afraid of the water ? ” he ask , look into her face with a sinist smile . “ oh , rodya , hush ! ” cri dounia bitterli . silenc last for two minut . he sat with hi eye fix on the floor ; dounia stood at the other end of the tabl and look at him with anguish . suddenli he got up . “ it ’ s late , it ’ s time to go ! i am go at onc to give myself up . but i don ’ t know whi i am go to give myself up. ” big tear fell down her cheek . “ you are cri , sister , but can you hold out your hand to me ? ” “ you doubt it ? ” she threw her arm round him . “ aren ’ t you half expiat your crime by face the suffer ? ” she cri , hold him close and kiss him . “ crime ? what crime ? ” he cri in sudden furi . “ that i kill a vile noxiou insect , an old pawnbrok woman , of use to no one ! ... kill her wa aton for forti sin . she wa suck the life out of poor peopl . wa that a crime ? i am not think of it and i am not think of expiat it , and whi are you all rub it in on all side ? ‘ a crime ! a crime ! ’ onli now i see clearli the imbecil of my cowardic , now that i have decid to face thi superflu disgrac . it ’ s simpli becaus i am contempt and have noth in me that i have decid to , perhap too for my advantag , as that ... porfiri ... suggest ! ” “ brother , brother , what are you say ? whi , you have shed blood ? ” cri dounia in despair . “ which all men shed , ” he put in almost frantic , “ which flow and ha alway flow in stream , which is spilt like champagn , and for which men are crown in the capitol and are call afterward benefactor of mankind . look into it more care and understand it ! i too want to do good to men and would have done hundr , thousand of good deed to make up for that one piec of stupid , not stupid even , simpli clumsi , for the idea wa by no mean so stupid as it seem now that it ha fail .... ( everyth seem stupid when it fail . ) by that stupid i onli want to put myself into an independ posit , to take the first step , to obtain mean , and then everyth would have been smooth over by benefit immeasur in comparison .... but i ... i couldn ’ t carri out even the first step , becaus i am contempt , that ’ s what ’ s the matter ! and yet i won ’ t look at it as you do . if i had succeed i should have been crown with glori , but now i ’ m trapped. ” “ but that ’ s not so , not so ! brother , what are you say ? ” “ ah , it ’ s not picturesqu , not æsthetic attract ! i fail to understand whi bombard peopl by regular sieg is more honour . the fear of appear is the first symptom of impot . i ’ ve never , never recognis thi more clearli than now , and i am further than ever from see that what i did wa a crime . i ’ ve never , never been stronger and more convinc than now. ” the colour had rush into hi pale exhaust face , but as he utter hi last explan , he happen to meet dounia ’ s eye and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help be check . he felt that he had , anyway , made these two poor women miser , that he wa , anyway , the caus ... “ dounia darl , if i am guilti forgiv me ( though i can not be forgiven if i am guilti ) . good-by ! we won ’ t disput . it ’ s time , high time to go . don ’ t follow me , i beseech you , i have somewher els to go .... but you go at onc and sit with mother . i entreat you to ! it ’ s my last request of you . don ’ t leav her at all ; i left her in a state of anxieti , that she is not fit to bear ; she will die or go out of her mind . be with her ! razumihin will be with you . i ’ ve been talk to him .... don ’ t cri about me : i ’ ll tri to be honest and manli all my life , even if i am a murder . perhap i shall some day make a name . i won ’ t disgrac you , you will see ; i ’ ll still show .... now good-by for the present , ” he conclud hurriedli , notic again a strang express in dounia ’ s eye at hi last word and promis . “ whi are you cri ? don ’ t cri , don ’ t cri : we are not part for ever ! ah , ye ! wait a minut , i ’ d forgotten ! ” he went to the tabl , took up a thick dusti book , open it and took from between the page a littl water-colour portrait on ivori . it wa the portrait of hi landladi ’ s daughter , who had die of fever , that strang girl who had want to be a nun . for a minut he gaze at the delic express face of hi betroth , kiss the portrait and gave it to dounia . “ i use to talk a great deal about it to her , onli to her , ” he said thought . “ to her heart i confid much of what ha sinc been so hideous realis . don ’ t be uneasi , ” he return to dounia , “ she wa as much oppos to it as you , and i am glad that she is gone . the great point is that everyth now is go to be differ , is go to be broken in two , ” he cri , suddenli return to hi deject . “ everyth , everyth , and am i prepar for it ? do i want it myself ? they say it is necessari for me to suffer ! what ’ s the object of these senseless suffer ? shall i know ani better what they are for , when i am crush by hardship and idioci , and weak as an old man after twenti year ’ penal servitud ? and what shall i have to live for then ? whi am i consent to that life now ? oh , i knew i wa contempt when i stood look at the neva at daybreak to-day ! ” at last they both went out . it wa hard for dounia , but she love him . she walk away , but after go fifti pace she turn round to look at him again . he wa still in sight . at the corner he too turn and for the last time their eye met ; but notic that she wa look at him , he motion her away with impati and even vexat , and turn the corner abruptli . “ i am wick , i see that , ” he thought to himself , feel asham a moment later of hi angri gestur to dounia . “ but whi are they so fond of me if i don ’ t deserv it ? oh , if onli i were alon and no one love me and i too had never love anyon ! _noth of all thi would have happened._ but i wonder shall i in those fifteen or twenti year grow so meek that i shall humbl myself befor peopl and whimper at everi word that i am a crimin ? ye , that ’ s it , that ’ s it , that ’ s what they are send me there for , that ’ s what they want . look at them run to and fro about the street , everi one of them a scoundrel and a crimin at heart and , wors still , an idiot . but tri to get me off and they ’ d be wild with righteou indign . oh , how i hate them all ! ” he fell to muse by what process it could come to pass , that he could be humbl befor all of them , indiscrimin -- humbl by convict . and yet whi not ? it must be so . would not twenti year of continu bondag crush him utterli ? water wear out a stone . and whi , whi should he live after that ? whi should he go now when he knew that it would be so ? it wa the hundredth time perhap that he had ask himself that question sinc the previou even , but still he went . chapter viii when he went into sonia ’ s room , it wa alreadi get dark . all day sonia had been wait for him in terribl anxieti . dounia had been wait with her . she had come to her that morn , rememb svidrigaïlov ’ s word that sonia knew . we will not describ the convers and tear of the two girl , and how friendli they becam . dounia gain one comfort at least from that interview , that her brother would not be alon . he had gone to her , sonia , first with hi confess ; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he need it ; she would go with him wherev fate might send him . dounia did not ask , but she knew it wa so . she look at sonia almost with rever and at first almost embarrass her by it . sonia wa almost on the point of tear . she felt herself , on the contrari , hardli worthi to look at dounia . dounia ’ s graciou imag when she had bow to her so attent and respect at their first meet in raskolnikov ’ s room had remain in her mind as one of the fairest vision of her life . dounia at last becam impati and , leav sonia , went to her brother ’ s room to await him there ; she kept think that he would come there first . when she had gone , sonia began to be tortur by the dread of hi commit suicid , and dounia too fear it . but they had spent the day tri to persuad each other that that could not be , and both were less anxiou while they were togeth . as soon as they part , each thought of noth els . sonia rememb how svidrigaïlov had said to her the day befor that raskolnikov had two altern -- siberia or ... besid she knew hi vaniti , hi pride and hi lack of faith . “ is it possibl that he ha noth but cowardic and fear of death to make him live ? ” she thought at last in despair . meanwhil the sun wa set . sonia wa stand in deject , look intent out of the window , but from it she could see noth but the unwhitewash blank wall of the next hous . at last when she began to feel sure of hi death -- he walk into the room . she gave a cri of joy , but look care into hi face she turn pale . “ ye , ” said raskolnikov , smile . “ i have come for your cross , sonia . it wa you told me to go to the cross-road ; whi is it you are frighten now it ’ s come to that ? ” sonia gaze at him astonish . hi tone seem strang to her ; a cold shiver ran over her , but in a moment she guess that the tone and the word were a mask . he spoke to her look away , as though to avoid meet her eye . “ you see , sonia , i ’ ve decid that it will be better so . there is one fact .... but it ’ s a long stori and there ’ s no need to discuss it . but do you know what anger me ? it annoy me that all those stupid brutish face will be gape at me directli , pester me with their stupid question , which i shall have to answer -- they ’ ll point their finger at me .... tfoo ! you know i am not go to porfiri , i am sick of him . i ’ d rather go to my friend , the explos lieuten ; how i shall surpris him , what a sensat i shall make ! but i must be cooler ; i ’ ve becom too irrit of late . you know i wa nearli shake my fist at my sister just now , becaus she turn to take a last look at me . it ’ s a brutal state to be in ! ah ! what am i come to ! well , where are the cross ? ” he seem hardli to know what he wa do . he could not stay still or concentr hi attent on anyth ; hi idea seem to gallop after one anoth , he talk incoher , hi hand trembl slightli . without a word sonia took out of the drawer two cross , one of cypress wood and one of copper . she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him , and put the wooden cross on hi neck . “ it ’ s the symbol of my take up the cross , ” he laugh . “ as though i had not suffer much till now ! the wooden cross , that is the peasant one ; the copper one , that is lizaveta ’ s -- you will wear yourself , show me ! so she had it on ... at that moment ? i rememb two thing like these too , a silver one and a littl ikon . i threw them back on the old woman ’ s neck . those would be appropri now , realli , those are what i ought to put on now .... but i am talk nonsens and forget what matter ; i ’ m somehow forget .... you see i have come to warn you , sonia , so that you might know ... that ’ s all -- that ’ s all i came for . but i thought i had more to say . you want me to go yourself . well , now i am go to prison and you ’ ll have your wish . well , what are you cri for ? you too ? don ’ t . leav off ! oh , how i hate it all ! ” but hi feel wa stir ; hi heart ach , as he look at her . “ whi is she griev too ? ” he thought to himself . “ what am i to her ? whi doe she weep ? whi is she look after me , like my mother or dounia ? she ’ ll be my nurse. ” “ cross yourself , say at least one prayer , ” sonia beg in a timid broken voic . “ oh certainli , as much as you like ! and sincer , sonia , sincer .... ” but he want to say someth quit differ . he cross himself sever time . sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head . it wa the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which marmeladov had spoken , “ the famili shawl. ” raskolnikov thought of that look at it , but he did not ask . he began to feel himself that he wa certainli forget thing and wa disgustingli agit . he wa frighten at thi . he wa suddenli struck too by the thought that sonia meant to go with him . “ what are you do ? where are you go ? stay here , stay ! i ’ ll go alon , ” he cri in cowardli vexat , and almost resent , he move toward the door . “ what ’ s the use of go in process ? ” he mutter go out . sonia remain stand in the middl of the room . he had not even said good-by to her ; he had forgotten her . a poignant and rebelli doubt surg in hi heart . “ wa it right , wa it right , all thi ? ” he thought again as he went down the stair . “ couldn ’ t he stop and retract it all ... and not go ? ” but still he went . he felt suddenli onc for all that he mustn ’ t ask himself question . as he turn into the street he rememb that he had not said good-by to sonia , that he had left her in the middl of the room in her green shawl , not dare to stir after he had shout at her , and he stop short for a moment . at the same instant , anoth thought dawn upon him , as though it had been lie in wait to strike him then . “ whi , with what object did i go to her just now ? i told her -- on busi ; on what busi ? i had no sort of busi ! to tell her i wa _going_ ; but where wa the need ? do i love her ? no , no , i drove her away just now like a dog . did i want her cross ? oh , how low i ’ ve sunk ! no , i want her tear , i want to see her terror , to see how her heart ach ! i had to have someth to cling to , someth to delay me , some friendli face to see ! and i dare to believ in myself , to dream of what i would do ! i am a beggarli contempt wretch , contempt ! ” he walk along the canal bank , and he had not much further to go . but on reach the bridg he stop and turn out of hi way along it went to the hay market . he look eagerli to right and left , gaze intent at everi object and could not fix hi attent on anyth ; everyth slip away . “ in anoth week , anoth month i shall be driven in a prison van over thi bridg , how shall i look at the canal then ? i should like to rememb thi ! ” slip into hi mind . “ look at thi sign ! how shall i read those letter then ? it ’ s written here ‘ campani , ’ that ’ s a thing to rememb , that letter _a_ , and to look at it again in a month -- how shall i look at it then ? what shall i be feel and think then ? ... how trivial it all must be , what i am fret about now ! of cours it must all be interest ... in it way ... ( ha-ha-ha ! what am i think about ? ) i am becom a babi , i am show off to myself ; whi am i asham ? foo ! how peopl shove ! that fat man -- a german he must be -- who push against me , doe he know whom he push ? there ’ s a peasant woman with a babi , beg . it ’ s curiou that she think me happier than she is . i might give her someth , for the incongru of it . here ’ s a five copeck piec left in my pocket , where did i get it ? here , here ... take it , my good woman ! ” “ god bless you , ” the beggar chant in a lachrymos voic . he went into the hay market . it wa distast , veri distast to be in a crowd , but he walk just where he saw most peopl . he would have given anyth in the world to be alon ; but he knew himself that he would not have remain alon for a moment . there wa a man drunk and disorderli in the crowd ; he kept tri to danc and fall down . there wa a ring round him . raskolnikov squeez hi way through the crowd , stare for some minut at the drunken man and suddenli gave a short jerki laugh . a minut later he had forgotten him and did not see him , though he still stare . he move away at last , not rememb where he wa ; but when he got into the middl of the squar an emot suddenli came over him , overwhelm him bodi and mind . he suddenli recal sonia ’ s word , “ go to the cross-road , bow down to the peopl , kiss the earth , for you have sin against it too , and say aloud to the whole world , ‘ i am a murderer. ’ ” he trembl , rememb that . and the hopeless miseri and anxieti of all that time , especi of the last hour , had weigh so heavili upon him that he posit clutch at the chanc of thi new unmix , complet sensat . it came over him like a fit ; it wa like a singl spark kindl in hi soul and spread fire through him . everyth in him soften at onc and the tear start into hi eye . he fell to the earth on the spot .... he knelt down in the middl of the squar , bow down to the earth , and kiss that filthi earth with bliss and raptur . he got up and bow down a second time . “ he ’ s booz , ” a youth near him observ . there wa a roar of laughter . “ he ’ s go to jerusalem , brother , and say good-by to hi children and hi countri . he ’ s bow down to all the world and kiss the great citi of st. petersburg and it pavement , ” ad a workman who wa a littl drunk . “ quit a young man , too ! ” observ a third . “ and a gentleman , ” someon observ soberli . “ there ’ s no know who ’ s a gentleman and who isn ’ t nowadays. ” these exclam and remark check raskolnikov , and the word , “ i am a murder , ” which were perhap on the point of drop from hi lip , die away . he bore these remark quietli , howev , and , without look round , he turn down a street lead to the polic offic . he had a glimps of someth on the way which did not surpris him ; he had felt that it must be so . the second time he bow down in the hay market he saw , stand fifti pace from him on the left , sonia . she wa hide from him behind one of the wooden shanti in the market-plac . she had follow him then on hi pain way ! raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew onc for all that sonia wa with him for ever and would follow him to the end of the earth , wherev fate might take him . it wrung hi heart ... but he wa just reach the fatal place . he went into the yard fairli resolut . he had to mount to the third storey . “ i shall be some time go up , ” he thought . he felt as though the fate moment wa still far off , as though he had plenti of time left for consider . again the same rubbish , the same eggshel lie about on the spiral stair , again the open door of the flat , again the same kitchen and the same fume and stench come from them . raskolnikov had not been here sinc that day . hi leg were numb and gave way under him , but still they move forward . he stop for a moment to take breath , to collect himself , so as to enter _like a man_ . “ but whi ? what for ? ” he wonder , reflect . “ if i must drink the cup what differ doe it make ? the more revolt the better. ” he imagin for an instant the figur of the “ explos lieuten , ” ilya petrovitch . wa he actual go to him ? couldn ’ t he go to someon els ? to nikodim fomitch ? couldn ’ t he turn back and go straight to nikodim fomitch ’ s lodg ? at least then it would be done privat .... no , no ! to the “ explos lieuten ” ! if he must drink it , drink it off at onc . turn cold and hardli consciou , he open the door of the offic . there were veri few peopl in it thi time -- onli a hous porter and a peasant . the doorkeep did not even peep out from behind hi screen . raskolnikov walk into the next room . “ perhap i still need not speak , ” pass through hi mind . some sort of clerk not wear a uniform wa settl himself at a bureau to write . in a corner anoth clerk wa seat himself . zametov wa not there , nor , of cours , nikodim fomitch . “ no one in ? ” raskolnikov ask , address the person at the bureau . “ whom do you want ? ” “ a-ah ! not a sound wa heard , not a sight wa seen , but i scent the russian ... how doe it go on in the fairi tale ... i ’ ve forgotten ! ‘ at your servic ! ’ ” a familiar voic cri suddenli . raskolnikov shudder . the explos lieuten stood befor him . he had just come in from the third room . “ it is the hand of fate , ” thought raskolnikov . “ whi is he here ? ” “ you ’ ve come to see us ? what about ? ” cri ilya petrovitch . he wa obvious in an exceedingli good humour and perhap a trifl exhilar . “ if it ’ s on busi you are rather earli . [ * ] it ’ s onli a chanc that i am here ... howev i ’ ll do what i can . i must admit , i ... what is it , what is it ? excus me .... ” [ * ] dostoevski appear to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time raskolnikov visit the polic offic at two in the afternoon he wa reproach for come too late. -- translat . “ raskolnikov. ” “ of cours , raskolnikov . you didn ’ t imagin i ’ d forgotten ? don ’ t think i am like that ... rodion ro -- ro -- rodionovitch , that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ? ” “ rodion romanovitch. ” “ ye , ye , of cours , rodion romanovitch ! i wa just get at it . i made mani inquiri about you . i assur you i ’ ve been genuin griev sinc that ... sinc i behav like that ... it wa explain to me afterward that you were a literari man ... and a learn one

that ’ s all ; one might have expect someth from him , but there , you know what they are , our brilliant young men . he want to go in for some examin , but it ’ s onli to talk and boast about it , it will go no further than that . of cours it ’ s a veri differ matter with you or mr. razumihin there , your friend . your career is an intellectu one and you won ’ t be deter by failur . for you , one may say , all the attract of life _nihil est_ -- you are an ascet , a monk , a hermit ! ... a book , a pen behind your ear , a learn research -- that ’ s where your spirit soar ! i am the same way

fulfil the duti of a man and a citizen , but who is he , may i ask ? i appeal to you as a man ennobl by educ ... then these midwiv , too , have becom extraordinarili numerous. ” raskolnikov rais hi eyebrow inquiringli . the word of ilya petrovitch , who had obvious been dine , were for the most part a stream of empti sound for him . but some of them he understood . he look at him inquiringli , not know how it would end . “ i mean those crop-head wench , ” the talk ilya petrovitch continu . “ midwiv is my name for them . i think it a veri satisfactori one , ha-ha ! they go to the academi , studi anatomi . if i fall ill , am i to send for a young ladi to treat me ? what do you say ? ha-ha ! ” ilya petrovitch laugh , quit pleas with hi own wit . “ it ’ s an immoder zeal for educ , but onc you ’ re educ , that ’ s enough . whi abus it ? whi insult honour peopl , as that scoundrel zametov doe ? whi did he insult me , i ask you ? look at these suicid , too , how common they are , you can ’ t fanci ! peopl spend their last halfpenni and kill themselv , boy and girl and old peopl . onli thi morn we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town . nil pavlitch , i say , what wa the name of that gentleman who shot himself ? ” “ svidrigaïlov , ” someon answer from the other room with drowsi listless . raskolnikov start . “ svidrigaïlov ! svidrigaïlov ha shot himself ! ” he cri . “ what , do you know svidrigaïlov ? ” “ ye ... i knew him .... he hadn ’ t been here long. ” “ ye , that ’ s so . he had lost hi wife , wa a man of reckless habit and all of a sudden shot himself , and in such a shock way .... he left in hi notebook a few word : that he die in full possess of hi faculti and that no one is to blame for hi death . he had money , they say . how did you come to know him ? ” “ i ... wa acquaint ... my sister wa gover in hi family. ” “ bah-bah-bah ! then no doubt you can tell us someth about him . you had no suspicion ? ” “ i saw him yesterday ... he ... wa drink wine ; i knew nothing. ” raskolnikov felt as though someth had fallen on him and wa stifl him . “ you ’ ve turn pale again . it ’ s so stuffi here ... ” “ ye , i must go , ” mutter raskolnikov . “ excus my troubl you .... ” “ oh , not at all , as often as you like . it ’ s a pleasur to see you and i am glad to say so. ” ilya petrovitch held out hi hand . “ i onli want ... i came to see zametov. ” “ i understand , i understand , and it ’ s a pleasur to see you. ” “ i ... am veri glad ... good-by , ” raskolnikov smile . he went out ; he reel , he wa overtaken with giddi and did not know what he wa do . he began go down the stair , support himself with hi right hand against the wall . he fanci that a porter push past him on hi way upstair to the polic offic , that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill bark and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shout . he went down and out into the yard . there , not far from the entranc , stood sonia , pale and horror-stricken . she look wildli at him . he stood still befor her . there wa a look of poignant agoni , of despair , in her face . she clasp her hand . hi lip work in an ugli , meaningless smile . he stood still a minut , grin and went back to the polic offic . ilya petrovitch had sat down and wa rummag among some paper . befor him stood the same peasant who had push by on the stair . “ hulloa ! back again ! have you left someth behind ? what ’ s the matter ? ” raskolnikov , with white lip and stare eye , came slowli nearer . he walk right to the tabl , lean hi hand on it , tri to say someth , but could not ; onli incoher sound were audibl . “ you are feel ill , a chair ! here , sit down ! some water ! ” raskolnikov drop on to a chair , but he kept hi eye fix on the face of ilya petrovitch , which express unpleas surpris . both look at one anoth for a minut and wait . water wa brought . “ it wa i ... ” began raskolnikov . “ drink some water. ” raskolnikov refus the water with hi hand , and softli and brokenli , but distinctli said : “ _it wa i kill the old pawnbrok woman and her sister lizaveta with an axe and rob them._ ” ilya petrovitch open hi mouth . peopl ran up on all side . raskolnikov repeat hi statement . epilogu i siberia . on the bank of a broad solitari river stand a town , one of the administr centr of russia ; in the town there is a fortress , in the fortress there is a prison . in the prison the second-class convict rodion raskolnikov ha been confin for nine month . almost a year and a half ha pass sinc hi crime . there had been littl difficulti about hi trial . the crimin adher exactli , firmli , and clearli to hi statement . he did not confus nor misrepres the fact , nor soften them in hi own interest , nor omit the smallest detail . he explain everi incid of the murder , the secret of _the pledge_ ( the piec of wood with a strip of metal ) which wa found in the murder woman ’ s hand . he describ minut how he had taken her key , what they were like , as well as the chest and it content ; he explain the mysteri of lizaveta ’ s murder ; describ how koch and , after him , the student knock , and repeat all they had said to one anoth ; how he afterward had run downstair and heard nikolay and dmitri shout ; how he had hidden in the empti flat and afterward gone home . he end by indic the stone in the yard off the voznesenski prospect under which the purs and the trinket were found . the whole thing , in fact , wa perfectli clear . the lawyer and the judg were veri much struck , among other thing , by the fact that he had hidden the trinket and the purs under a stone , without make use of them , and that , what wa more , he did not now rememb what the trinket were like , or even how mani there were . the fact that he had never open the purs and did not even know how much wa in it seem incred . there turn out to be in the purs three hundr and seventeen roubl and sixti copeck . from be so long under the stone , some of the most valuabl note lie uppermost had suffer from the damp . they were a long while tri to discov whi the accus man should tell a lie about thi , when about everyth els he had made a truth and straightforward confess . final some of the lawyer more vers in psycholog admit that it wa possibl he had realli not look into the purs , and so didn ’ t know what wa in it when he hid it under the stone . but they immedi drew the deduct that the crime could onli have been commit through temporari mental derang , through homicid mania , without object or the pursuit of gain . thi fell in with the most recent fashion theori of temporari insan , so often appli in our day in crimin case . moreov raskolnikov ’ s hypochondriac condit wa prove by mani wit , by dr. zossimov , hi former fellow student , hi landladi and her servant . all thi point strongli to the conclus that raskolnikov wa not quit like an ordinari murder and robber , but that there wa anoth element in the case . to the intens annoy of those who maintain thi opinion , the crimin scarc attempt to defend himself . to the decis question as to what motiv impel him to the murder and the robberi , he answer veri clearli with the coarsest frank that the caus wa hi miser posit , hi poverti and helpless , and hi desir to provid for hi first step in life by the help of the three thousand roubl he had reckon on find . he had been led to the murder through hi shallow and cowardli natur , exasper moreov by privat and failur . to the question what led him to confess , he answer that it wa hi heartfelt repent . all thi wa almost coars .... the sentenc howev wa more merci than could have been expect , perhap partli becaus the crimin had not tri to justifi himself , but had rather shown a desir to exagger hi guilt . all the strang and peculiar circumst of the crime were taken into consider . there could be no doubt of the abnorm and poverty-stricken condit of the crimin at the time . the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen wa put down partli to the effect of remors , partli to hi abnorm mental condit at the time of the crime . incident the murder of lizaveta serv inde to confirm the last hypothesi : a man commit two murder and forget that the door is open ! final , the confess , at the veri moment when the case wa hopelessli muddl by the fals evid given by nikolay through melancholi and fanatic , and when , moreov , there were no proof against the real crimin , no suspicion even ( porfiri petrovitch fulli kept hi word ) -- all thi did much to soften the sentenc . other circumst , too , in the prison ’ s favour came out quit unexpectedli . razumihin somehow discov and prove that while raskolnikov wa at the univers he had help a poor consumpt fellow student and had spent hi last penni on support him for six month , and when thi student die , leav a decrepit old father whom he had maintain almost from hi thirteenth year , raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospit and paid for hi funer when he die . raskolnikov ’ s landladi bore wit , too , that when they had live in anoth hous at five corner , raskolnikov had rescu two littl children from a hous on fire and wa burnt in do so . thi wa investig and fairli well confirm by mani wit . these fact made an impress in hi favour . and in the end the crimin wa , in consider of extenu circumst , condemn to penal servitud in the second class for a term of eight year onli . at the veri begin of the trial raskolnikov ’ s mother fell ill. dounia and razumihin found it possibl to get her out of petersburg dure the trial . razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from petersburg , so as to be abl to follow everi step of the trial and at the same time to see avdotya romanovna as often as possibl . pulcheria alexandrovna ’ s ill wa a strang nervou one and wa accompani by a partial derang of her intellect . when dounia return from her last interview with her brother , she had found her mother alreadi ill , in feverish delirium . that even razumihin and she agre what answer they must make to her mother ’ s question about raskolnikov and made up a complet stori for her mother ’ s benefit of hi have to go away to a distant part of russia on a busi commiss , which would bring him in the end money and reput . but they were struck by the fact that pulcheria alexandrovna never ask them anyth on the subject , neither then nor thereaft . on the contrari , she had her own version of her son ’ s sudden departur ; she told them with tear how he had come to say good-by to her , hint that she alon knew mani mysteri and import fact , and that rodya had mani veri power enemi , so that it wa necessari for him to be in hide . as for hi futur career , she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinist influenc could be remov . she assur razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman , that hi articl and brilliant literari talent prove it . thi articl she wa continu read , she even read it aloud , almost took it to bed with her , but scarc ask where rodya wa , though the subject wa obvious avoid by the other , which might have been enough to awaken her suspicion . they began to be frighten at last at pulcheria alexandrovna ’ s strang silenc on certain subject . she did not , for instanc , complain of get no letter from him , though in previou year she had onli live on the hope of letter from her belov rodya . thi wa the caus of great uneasi to dounia ; the idea occur to her that her mother suspect that there wa someth terribl in her son ’ s fate and wa afraid to ask , for fear of hear someth still more aw . in ani case , dounia saw clearli that her mother wa not in full possess of her faculti . it happen onc or twice , howev , that pulcheria alexandrovna gave such a turn to the convers that it wa imposs to answer her without mention where rodya wa , and on receiv unsatisfactori and suspici answer she becam at onc gloomi and silent , and thi mood last for a long time . dounia saw at last that it wa hard to deceiv her and came to the conclus that it wa better to be absolut silent on certain point ; but it becam more and more evid that the poor mother suspect someth terribl . dounia rememb her brother ’ s tell her that her mother had overheard her talk in her sleep on the night after her interview with svidrigaïlov and befor the fatal day of the confess : had not she made out someth from that ? sometim day and even week of gloomi silenc and tear would be succeed by a period of hyster anim , and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantli of her son , of her hope of hi futur .... her fanci were sometim veri strang . they humour her , pretend to agre with her ( she saw perhap that they were pretend ) , but she still went on talk . five month after raskolnikov ’ s confess , he wa sentenc . razumihin and sonia saw him in prison as often as it wa possibl . at last the moment of separ came . dounia swore to her brother that the separ should not be for ever , razumihin did the same . razumihin , in hi youth ardour , had firmli resolv to lay the foundat at least of a secur livelihood dure the next three or four year , and save up a certain sum , to emigr to siberia , a countri rich in everi natur resourc and in need of worker , activ men and capit . there they would settl in the town where rodya wa and all togeth would begin a new life . they all wept at part . raskolnikov had been veri dreami for a few day befor . he ask a great deal about hi mother and wa constantli anxiou about her . he worri so much about her that it alarm dounia . when he heard about hi mother ’ s ill he becam veri gloomi . with sonia he wa particularli reserv all the time . with the help of the money left to her by svidrigaïlov , sonia had long ago made her prepar to follow the parti of convict in which he wa despatch to siberia . not a word pass between raskolnikov and her on the subject , but both knew it would be so . at the final leave-tak he smile strang at hi sister ’ s and razumihin ’ s fervent anticip of their happi futur togeth when he should come out of prison . he predict that their mother ’ s ill would soon have a fatal end . sonia and he at last set off . two month later dounia wa marri to razumihin . it wa a quiet and sorrow wed ; porfiri petrovitch and zossimov were invit howev . dure all thi period razumihin wore an air of resolut determin . dounia put implicit faith in hi carri out hi plan and inde she could not but believ in him . he display a rare strength of will . among other thing he began attend univers lectur again in order to take hi degre . they were continu make plan for the futur ; both count on settl in siberia within five year at least . till then they rest their hope on sonia . pulcheria alexandrovna wa delight to give her bless to dounia ’ s marriag with razumihin ; but after the marriag she becam even more melancholi and anxiou . to give her pleasur razumihin told her how raskolnikov had look after the poor student and hi decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injur in rescu two littl children from a fire . these two piec of news excit pulcheria alexandrovna ’ s disord imagin almost to ecstasi . she wa continu talk about them , even enter into convers with stranger in the street , though dounia alway accompani her . in public convey and shop , wherev she could captur a listen , she would begin the discours about her son , hi articl , how he had help the student , how he had been burnt at the fire , and so on ! dounia did not know how to restrain her . apart from the danger of her morbid excit , there wa the risk of someon ’ s recal raskolnikov ’ s name and speak of the recent trial . pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had save and insist on go to see her . at last her restless reach an extrem point . she would sometim begin to cri suddenli and wa often ill and feverishli deliri . one morn she declar that by her reckon rodya ought soon to be home , that she rememb when he said good-by to her he said that they must expect him back in nine month . she began to prepar for hi come , began to do up her room for him , to clean the furnitur , to wash and put up new hang and so on . dounia wa anxiou , but said noth and help her to arrang the room . after a fatigu day spent in continu fanci , in joy day-dream and tear , pulcheria alexandrovna wa taken ill in the night and by morn she wa feverish and deliri . it wa brain fever . she die within a fortnight . in her delirium she drop word which show that she knew a great deal more about her son ’ s terribl fate than they had suppos . for a long time raskolnikov did not know of hi mother ’ s death , though a regular correspond had been maintain from the time he reach siberia . it wa carri on by mean of sonia , who wrote everi month to the razumihin and receiv an answer with unfail regular . at first they found sonia ’ s letter dri and unsatisfactori , but later on they came to the conclus that the letter could not be better , for from these letter they receiv a complet pictur of their unfortun brother ’ s life . sonia ’ s letter were full of the most matter-of-fact detail , the simplest and clearest descript of all raskolnikov ’ s surround as a convict . there wa no word of her own hope , no conjectur as to the futur , no descript of her feel . instead of ani attempt to interpret hi state of mind and inner life , she gave the simpl fact -- that is , hi own word , an exact account of hi health , what he ask for at their interview , what commiss he gave her and so on . all these fact she gave with extraordinari minut . the pictur of their unhappi brother stood out at last with great clear and precis . there could be no mistak , becaus noth wa given but fact . but dounia and her husband could get littl comfort out of the news , especi at first . sonia wrote that he wa constantli sullen and not readi to talk , that he scarc seem interest in the news she gave him from their letter , that he sometim ask after hi mother and that when , see that he had guess the truth , she told him at last of her death , she wa surpris to find that he did not seem greatli affect by it , not extern at ani rate . she told them that , although he seem so wrap up in himself and , as it were , shut himself off from everyon -- he took a veri direct and simpl view of hi new life ; that he understood hi posit , expect noth better for the time , had no ill-found hope ( as is so common in hi posit ) and scarc seem surpris at anyth in hi surround , so unlik anyth he had known befor . she wrote that hi health wa satisfactori ; he did hi work without shirk or seek to do more ; he wa almost indiffer about food , but except on sunday and holiday the food wa so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her , sonia , to have hi own tea everi day . he beg her not to troubl about anyth els , declar that all thi fuss about him onli annoy him . sonia wrote further that in prison he share the same room with the rest , that she had not seen the insid of their barrack , but conclud that they were crowd , miser and unhealthi ; that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and wa unwil to make ani other arrang . but that he live so poorli and roughli , not from ani plan or design , but simpli from inattent and indiffer . sonia wrote simpli that he had at first shown no interest in her visit , had almost been vex with her inde for come , unwil to talk and rude to her . but that in the end these visit had becom a habit and almost a necess for him , so that he wa posit distress when she wa ill for some day and could not visit him . she use to see him on holiday at the prison gate or in the guard-room , to which he wa brought for a few minut to see her . on work day she would go to see him at work either at the workshop or at the brick kiln , or at the shed on the bank of the irtish . about herself , sonia wrote that she had succeed in make some acquaint in the town , that she did sew , and , as there wa scarc a dressmak in the town , she wa look upon as an indispens person in mani hous . but she did not mention that the author were , through her , interest in raskolnikov ; that hi task wa lighten and so on . at last the news came ( dounia had inde notic sign of alarm and uneasi in the preced letter ) that he held aloof from everyon , that hi fellow prison did not like him , that he kept silent for day at a time and wa becom veri pale . in the last letter sonia wrote that he had been taken veri serious ill and wa in the convict ward of the hospit . ii he wa ill a long time . but it wa not the horror of prison life , not the hard labour , the bad food , the shaven head , or the patch cloth that crush him . what did he care for all those trial and hardship ! he wa even glad of the hard work . physic exhaust , he could at least reckon on a few hour of quiet sleep . and what wa the food to him -- the thin cabbag soup with beetl float in it ? in the past as a student he had often not had even that . hi cloth were warm and suit to hi manner of life . he did not even feel the fetter . wa he asham of hi shaven head and parti-colour coat ? befor whom ? befor sonia ? sonia wa afraid of him , how could he be asham befor her ? and yet he wa asham even befor sonia , whom he tortur becaus of it with hi contemptu rough manner . but it wa not hi shaven head and hi fetter he wa asham of : hi pride had been stung to the quick . it wa wound pride that made him ill. oh , how happi he would have been if he could have blame himself ! he could have born anyth then , even shame and disgrac . but he judg himself sever , and hi exasper conscienc found no particularli terribl fault in hi past , except a simpl _blunder_ which might happen to anyon . he wa asham just becaus he , raskolnikov , had so hopelessli , stupidli come to grief through some decre of blind fate , and must humbl himself and submit to “ the idioci ” of a sentenc , if he were anyhow to be at peac . vagu and objectless anxieti in the present , and in the futur a continu sacrific lead to noth -- that wa all that lay befor him . and what comfort wa it to him that at the end of eight year he would onli be thirty-two and abl to begin a new life ! what had he to live for ? what had he to look forward to ? whi should he strive ? to live in order to exist ? whi , he had been readi a thousand time befor to give up exist for the sake of an idea , for a hope , even for a fanci . mere exist had alway been too littl for him ; he had alway want more . perhap it wa just becaus of the strength of hi desir that he had thought himself a man to whom more wa permiss than to other . and if onli fate would have sent him repent -- burn repent that would have torn hi heart and rob him of sleep , that repent , the aw agoni of which bring vision of hang or drown ! oh , he would have been glad of it ! tear and agoni would at least have been life . but he did not repent of hi crime . at least he might have found relief in rage at hi stupid , as he had rage at the grotesqu blunder that had brought him to prison . but now in prison , _in freedom_ , he thought over and criticis all hi action again and by no mean found them so blunder and so grotesqu as they had seem at the fatal time . “ in what way , ” he ask himself , “ wa my theori stupid than other that have swarm and clash from the begin of the world ? one ha onli to look at the thing quit independ , broadli , and uninfluenc by commonplac idea , and my idea will by no mean seem so ... strang . oh , sceptic and halfpenni philosoph , whi do you halt half-way ! “ whi doe my action strike them as so horribl ? ” he said to himself . “ is it becaus it wa a crime ? what is meant by crime ? my conscienc is at rest . of cours , it wa a legal crime , of cours , the letter of the law wa broken and blood wa shed . well , punish me for the letter of the law ... and that ’ s enough . of cours , in that case mani of the benefactor of mankind who snatch power for themselv instead of inherit it ought to have been punish at their first step . but those men succeed and so _they were right_ , and i didn ’ t , and so i had no right to have taken that step. ” it wa onli in that that he recognis hi crimin , onli in the fact that he had been unsuccess and had confess it . he suffer too from the question : whi had he not kill himself ? whi had he stood look at the river and prefer to confess ? wa the desir to live so strong and wa it so hard to overcom it ? had not svidrigaïlov overcom it , although he wa afraid of death ? in miseri he ask himself thi question , and could not understand that , at the veri time he had been stand look into the river , he had perhap been dimli consciou of the fundament falsiti in himself and hi convict . he didn ’ t understand that that conscious might be the promis of a futur crisi , of a new view of life and of hi futur resurrect . he prefer to attribut it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over , again through weak and mean . he look at hi fellow prison and wa amaz to see how they all love life and prize it . it seem to him that they love and valu life more in prison than in freedom . what terribl agoni and privat some of them , the tramp for instanc , had endur ! could they care so much for a ray of sunshin , for the primev forest , the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot , which the tramp had mark three year befor , and long to see again , as he might to see hi sweetheart , dream of the green grass round it and the bird sing in the bush ? as he went on he saw still more inexplic exampl . in prison , of cours , there wa a great deal he did not see and did not want to see ; he live as it were with downcast eye . it wa loathsom and unbear for him to look . but in the end there wa much that surpris him and he began , as it were involuntarili , to notic much that he had not suspect befor . what surpris him most of all wa the terribl imposs gulf that lay between him and all the rest . they seem to be a differ speci , and he look at them and they at him with distrust and hostil . he felt and knew the reason of hi isol , but he would never have admit till then that those reason were so deep and strong . there were some polish exil , polit prison , among them . they simpli look down upon all the rest as ignor churl ; but raskolnikov could not look upon them like that . he saw that these ignor men were in mani respect far wiser than the pole . there were some russian who were just as contemptu , a former offic and two seminarist . raskolnikov saw their mistak as clearli . he wa dislik and avoid by everyon ; they even began to hate him at last -- whi , he could not tell . men who had been far more guilti despis and laugh at hi crime . “ you ’ re a gentleman , ” they use to say . “ you shouldn ’ t hack about with an axe ; that ’ s not a gentleman ’ s work. ” the second week in lent , hi turn came to take the sacrament with hi gang . he went to church and pray with the other . a quarrel broke out one day , he did not know how . all fell on him at onc in a furi . “ you ’ re an infidel ! you don ’ t believ in god , ” they shout . “ you ought to be killed. ” he had never talk to them about god nor hi belief , but they want to kill him as an infidel . he said noth . one of the prison rush at him in a perfect frenzi . raskolnikov await him calmli and silent ; hi eyebrow did not quiver , hi face did not flinch . the guard succeed in interven between him and hi assail , or there would have been bloodsh . there wa anoth question he could not decid : whi were they all so fond of sonia ? she did not tri to win their favour ; she rare met them , sometim onli she came to see him at work for a moment . and yet everybodi knew her , they knew that she had come out to follow _him_ , knew how and where she live . she never gave them money , did them no particular servic . onli onc at christma she sent them all present of pie and roll . but by degre closer relat sprang up between them and sonia . she would write and post letter for them to their relat . relat of the prison who visit the town , at their instruct , left with sonia present and money for them . their wive and sweetheart knew her and use to visit her . and when she visit raskolnikov at work , or met a parti of the prison on the road , they all took off their hat to her . “ littl mother sofya semyonovna , you are our dear , good littl mother , ” coars brand crimin said to that frail littl creatur . she would smile and bow to them and everyon wa delight when she smile . they even admir her gait and turn round to watch her walk ; they admir her too for be so littl , and , in fact , did not know what to admir her most for . they even came to her for help in their ill . he wa in the hospit from the middl of lent till after easter . when he wa better , he rememb the dream he had had while he wa feverish and deliri . he dreamt that the whole world wa condemn to a terribl new strang plagu that had come to europ from the depth of asia . all were to be destroy except a veri few chosen . some new sort of microb were attack the bodi of men , but these microb were endow with intellig and will . men attack by them becam at onc mad and furiou . but never had men consid themselv so intellectu and so complet in possess of the truth as these suffer , never had they consid their decis , their scientif conclus , their moral convict so infal . whole villag , whole town and peopl went mad from the infect . all were excit and did not understand one anoth . each thought that he alon had the truth and wa wretch look at the other , beat himself on the breast , wept , and wrung hi hand . they did not know how to judg and could not agre what to consid evil and what good ; they did not know whom to blame , whom to justifi . men kill each other in a sort of senseless spite . they gather togeth in armi against one anoth , but even on the march the armi would begin attack each other , the rank would be broken and the soldier would fall on each other , stab and cut , bite and devour each other . the alarm bell wa ring all day long in the town ; men rush togeth , but whi they were summon and who wa summon them no one knew . the most ordinari trade were abandon , becaus everyon propos hi own idea , hi own improv , and they could not agre . the land too wa abandon . men met in group , agre on someth , swore to keep togeth , but at onc began on someth quit differ from what they had propos . they accus one anoth , fought and kill each other . there were conflagr and famin . all men and all thing were involv in destruct . the plagu spread and move further and further . onli a few men could be save in the whole world . they were a pure chosen peopl , destin to found a new race and a new life , to renew and purifi the earth , but no one had seen these men , no one had heard their word and their voic . raskolnikov wa worri that thi senseless dream haunt hi memori so miser , the impress of thi feverish delirium persist so long . the second week after easter had come . there were warm bright spring day ; in the prison ward the grate window under which the sentinel pace were open . sonia had onli been abl to visit him twice dure hi ill ; each time she had to obtain permiss , and it wa difficult . but she often use to come to the hospit yard , especi in the even , sometim onli to stand a minut and look up at the window of the ward . one even , when he wa almost well again , raskolnikov fell asleep . on wake up he chanc to go to the window , and at onc saw sonia in the distanc at the hospit gate . she seem to be wait for someon . someth stab him to the heart at that minut . he shudder and move away from the window . next day sonia did not come , nor the day after ; he notic that he wa expect her uneasili . at last he wa discharg . on reach the prison he learnt from the convict that sofya semyonovna wa lie ill at home and wa unabl to go out . he wa veri uneasi and sent to inquir after her ; he soon learnt that her ill wa not danger . hear that he wa anxiou about her , sonia sent him a pencil note , tell him that she wa much better , that she had a slight cold and that she would soon , veri soon come and see him at hi work . hi heart throb pain as he read it . again it wa a warm bright day . earli in the morn , at six o ’ clock , he went off to work on the river bank , where they use to pound alabast and where there wa a kiln for bake it in a shed . there were onli three of them sent . one of the convict went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool ; the other began get the wood readi and lay it in the kiln . raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank , sat down on a heap of log by the shed and began gaze at the wide desert river . from the high bank a broad landscap open befor him , the sound of sing float faintli audibl from the other bank . in the vast stepp , bath in sunshin , he could just see , like black speck , the nomad ’ tent . there there wa freedom , there other men were live , utterli unlik those here ; there time itself seem to stand still , as though the age of abraham and hi flock had not pass . raskolnikov sat gaze , hi thought pass into day-dream , into contempl ; he thought of noth , but a vagu restless excit and troubl him . suddenli he found sonia besid him ; she had come up noiselessli and sat down at hi side . it wa still quit earli ; the morn chill wa still keen . she wore her poor old burnou and the green shawl ; her face still show sign of ill , it wa thinner and paler . she gave him a joy smile of welcom , but held out her hand with her usual timid . she wa alway timid of hold out her hand to him and sometim did not offer it at all , as though afraid he would repel it . he alway took her hand as though with repugn , alway seem vex to meet her and wa sometim obstin silent throughout her visit . sometim she trembl befor him and went away deepli griev . but now their hand did not part . he stole a rapid glanc at her and drop hi eye on the ground without speak . they were alon , no one had seen them . the guard had turn away for the time . how it happen he did not know . but all at onc someth seem to seiz him and fling him at her feet . he wept and threw hi arm round her knee . for the first instant she wa terribl frighten and she turn pale . she jump up and look at him trembl . but at the same moment she understood , and a light of infinit happi came into her eye . she knew and had no doubt that he love her beyond everyth and that at last the moment had come .... they want to speak , but could not ; tear stood in their eye . they were both pale and thin ; but those sick pale face were bright with the dawn of a new futur , of a full resurrect into a new life . they were renew by love ; the heart of each held infinit sourc of life for the heart of the other . they resolv to wait and be patient . they had anoth seven year to wait , and what terribl suffer and what infinit happi befor them ! but he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all hi be , while she -- she onli live in hi life . on the even of the same day , when the barrack were lock , raskolnikov lay on hi plank bed and thought of her . he had even fanci that day that all the convict who had been hi enemi look at him differ ; he had even enter into talk with them and they answer him in a friendli way . he rememb that now , and thought it wa bound to be so . wasn ’ t everyth now bound to be chang ? he thought of her . he rememb how continu he had torment her and wound her heart . he rememb her pale and thin littl face . but these recollect scarc troubl him now ; he knew with what infinit love he would now repay all her suffer . and what were all , _all_ the agoni of the past ! everyth , even hi crime , hi sentenc and imprison , seem to him now in the first rush of feel an extern , strang fact with which he had no concern . but he could not think for long togeth of anyth that even , and he could not have analys anyth conscious ; he wa simpli feel . life had step into the place of theori and someth quit differ would work itself out in hi mind . under hi pillow lay the new testament . he took it up mechan . the book belong to sonia ; it wa the one from which she had read the rais of lazaru to him . at first he wa afraid that she would worri him about religion , would talk about the gospel and pester him with book . but to hi great surpris she had not onc approach the subject and had not even offer him the testament . he had ask her for it himself not long befor hi ill and she brought him the book without a word . till now he had not open it . he did not open it now , but one thought pass through hi mind : “ can her convict not be mine now ? her feel , her aspir at least .... ” she too had been greatli agit that day , and at night she wa taken ill again . but she wa so happi -- and so unexpectedli happi -- that she wa almost frighten of her happi . seven year , _only_ seven year ! at the begin of their happi at some moment they were both readi to look on those seven year as though they were seven day . he did not know that the new life would not be given him for noth , that he would have to pay dearli for it , that it would cost him great strive , great suffer . but that is the begin of a new stori -- the stori of the gradual renew of a man , the stori of hi gradual regener , of hi pass from one world into anoth , of hi initi into a new unknown life . that might be the subject of a new stori , but our present stori is end

Dostoevsky wa the son of a doctor . His parent were very hard-working and deeply religious people , but so poor that they lived with their five child in only two room . The father and mother spent their evening in reading aloud to their child , generally from book of a serious character . Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering . There he had already begun his first work , “ Poor Folk. ” This story wa published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and wa received with acclamation . The shy , unknown youth found himself instantly something of a celebrity . A brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him , but those hope were soon dashed . In 1849 he wa arrested . Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist , Dostoevsky wa one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier and Proudhon . He wa accused of “ taking part in conversation against the censorship , of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol , and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press. ” Under Nicholas I . ( that “ stern and just man , ” a Maurice Baring call him ) this wa enough , and he wa condemned to death . After eight month ’ imprisonment he wa with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot . Writing to his brother Mihail , Dostoevsky say : “ They snapped word over our head , and they made u put on the white shirt worn by person condemned to death . Thereupon we were bound in three to stake , to suffer execution . Being the third in the row , I concluded I had only a few minute of life before me . I thought of you and your dear one and I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov , who were next to me , and to bid them farewell . Suddenly the troop beat a tattoo , we were unbound , brought back upon the scaffold , and informed that his Majesty had spared u our lives. ” The sentence wa commuted to hard labour . One of the prisoner , Grigoryev , went mad a soon a he wa untied , and never regained his sanity . The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on Dostoevsky ’ s mind . Though his religious temper led him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it a a blessing in his own case , he constantly recurs to the subject in his writing . He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture . Then followed four year of penal servitude , spent in the company of common criminal in Siberia , where he began the “ Dead House , ” and some year of service in a disciplinary battalion . He had shown sign of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest and this now developed into violent attack of epilepsy , from which he suffered for the rest of his life . The fit occurred three or four time a year and were more frequent in period of great strain . In 1859 he wa allowed to return to Russia . He started a journal -- “ Vremya , ” which wa forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding . In 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail . He wa in terrible poverty , yet he took upon himself the payment of his brother ’ s debt . He started another journal -- “ The Epoch , ” which within a few month wa also prohibited . He wa weighed down by debt , his brother ’ s family wa dependent on him , he wa forced to write at heart-breaking speed , and is said never to have corrected his work . The later year of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife . In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he wa received with extraordinary demonstration of love and honour . A few month later Dostoevsky died . He wa followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourner , who “ gave the hapless man the funeral of a king. ” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia . In the word of a Russian critic , who seek to explain the feeling inspired by Dostoevsky : “ He wa one of ourselves , a man of our blood and our bone , but one who ha suffered and ha seen so much more deeply than we have his insight impress u a wisdom ... that wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live . All his other gift came to him from nature , this he won for himself and through it he became great. ” CRIME AND PUNISHMENT PART I CHAPTER I On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly , a though in hesitation , towards K. bridge . He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase . His garret wa under the roof of a high , five-storied house and wa more like a cupboard than a room . The landlady who provided him with garret , dinner , and attendance , lived on the floor below , and every time he went out he wa obliged to pas her kitchen , the door of which invariably stood open . And each time he passed , the young man had a sick , frightened feeling , which made him scowl and feel ashamed . He wa hopelessly in debt to his landlady , and wa afraid of meeting her . This wa not because he wa cowardly and abject , quite the contrary ; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition , verging on hypochondria . He had become so completely absorbed in himself , and isolated from his fellow that he dreaded meeting , not only his landlady , but anyone at all . He wa crushed by poverty , but the anxiety of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him . He had given up attending to matter of practical importance ; he had lost all desire to do so . Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him . But to be stopped on the stair , to be forced to listen to her trivial , irrelevant gossip , to pestering demand for payment , threat and complaint , and to rack his brain for excuse , to prevaricate , to lie -- no , rather than that , he would creep down the stair like a cat and slip out unseen . This evening , however , on coming out into the street , he became acutely aware of his fear . “ I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these trifle , ” he thought , with an odd smile . “ Hm ... yes , all is in a man ’ s hand and he let it all slip from cowardice , that ’ s an axiom . It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of . Taking a new step , uttering a new word is what they fear most .... But I am talking too much . It ’ s because I chatter that I do nothing . Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing . I ’ ve learned to chatter this last month , lying for day together in my den thinking ... of Jack the Giant-killer . Why am I going there now ? Am I capable of _that_ ? Is _that_ serious ? It is not serious at all . It ’ s simply a fantasy to amuse myself ; a plaything ! Yes , maybe it is a plaything. ” The heat in the street wa terrible : and the airlessness , the bustle and the plaster , scaffolding , brick , and dust all about him , and that special Petersburg stench , so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer -- all worked painfully upon the young man ’ s already overwrought nerve . The insufferable stench from the pot-houses , which are particularly numerous in that part of the town , and the drunken men whom he met continually , although it wa a working day , completed the revolting misery of the picture . An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man ’ s refined face . He wa , by the way , exceptionally handsome , above the average in height , slim , well-built , with beautiful dark eye and dark brown hair . Soon he sank into deep thought , or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind ; he walked along not observing what wa about him and not caring to observe it . From time to time , he would mutter something , from the habit of talking to himself , to which he had just confessed . At these moment he would become conscious that his idea were sometimes in a tangle and that he wa very weak ; for two day he had scarcely tasted food . He wa so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rag . In that quarter of the town , however , scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise . Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market , the number of establishment of bad character , the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these street and alley in the heart of Petersburg , type so various were to be seen in the street that no figure , however queer , would have caused surprise . But there wa such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man ’ s heart , that , in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth , he minded his rag least of all in the street . It wa a different matter when he met with acquaintance or with former fellow student , whom , indeed , he disliked meeting at any time . And yet when a drunken man who , for some unknown reason , wa being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse , suddenly shouted at him a he drove past : “ Hey there , German hatter ” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him -- the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat . It wa a tall round hat from Zimmerman ’ s , but completely worn out , rusty with age , all torn and bespattered , brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion . Not shame , however , but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him . “ I knew it , ” he muttered in confusion , “ I thought so ! That ’ s the worst of all ! Why , a stupid thing like this , the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan . Yes , my hat is too noticeable .... It look absurd and that make it noticeable .... With my rag I ought to wear a cap , any sort of old pancake , but not this grotesque thing . Nobody wear such a hat , it would be noticed a mile off , it would be remembered .... What matter is that people would remember it , and that would give them a clue . For this business one should be a little conspicuous a possible .... Trifles , trifle are what matter ! Why , it ’ s just such trifle that always ruin everything .... ” He had not far to go ; he knew indeed how many step it wa from the gate of his lodging house : exactly seven hundred and thirty . He had counted them once when he had been lost in dream . At the time he had put no faith in those dream and wa only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness . Now , a month later , he had begun to look upon them differently , and , in spite of the monologue in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision , he had involuntarily come to regard this “ hideous ” dream a an exploit to be attempted , although he still did not realise this himself . He wa positively going now for a “ rehearsal ” of his project , and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent . With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor , he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal , and on the other into the street . This house wa let out in tiny tenement and wa inhabited by working people of all kind -- tailor , locksmith , cook , Germans of sort , girl picking up a living a best they could , petty clerk , etc . There wa a continual coming and going through the two gate and in the two courtyard of the house . Three or four door-keepers were employed on the building . The young man wa very glad to meet none of them , and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right , and up the staircase . It wa a back staircase , dark and narrow , but he wa familiar with it already , and knew his way , and he liked all these surroundings : in such darkness even the most inquisitive eye were not to be dreaded . “ If I am so scared now , what would it be if it somehow came to pas that I were really going to do it ? ” he could not help asking himself a he reached the fourth storey . There his progress wa barred by some porter who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat . He knew that the flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service , and his family . This German wa moving out then , and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman . “ That ’ s a good thing anyway , ” he thought to himself , a he rang the bell of the old woman ’ s flat . The bell gave a faint tinkle a though it were made of tin and not of copper . The little flat in such house always have bell that ring like that . He had forgotten the note of that bell , and now it peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him .... He started , his nerve were terribly overstrained by now . In a little while , the door wa opened a tiny crack : the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack , and nothing could be seen but her little eye , glittering in the darkness . But , seeing a number of people on the landing , she grew bolder , and opened the door wide . The young man stepped into the dark entry , which wa partitioned off from the tiny kitchen . The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him . She wa a diminutive , withered up old woman of sixty , with sharp malignant eye and a sharp little nose . Her colourless , somewhat grizzled hair wa thickly smeared with oil , and she wore no kerchief over it . Round her thin long neck , which looked like a hen ’ s leg , wa knotted some sort of flannel rag , and , in spite of the heat , there hung flapping on her shoulder , a mangy fur cape , yellow with age . The old woman coughed and groaned at every instant . The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression , for a gleam of mistrust came into her eye again . “ Raskolnikov , a student , I came here a month ago , ” the young man made haste to mutter , with a half bow , remembering that he ought to be more polite . “ I remember , my good sir , I remember quite well your coming here , ” the old woman said distinctly , still keeping her inquiring eye on his face . “ And here ... I am again on the same errand , ” Raskolnikov continued , a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman ’ s mistrust . “ Perhaps she is always like that though , only I did not notice it the other time , ” he thought with an uneasy feeling . The old woman paused , a though hesitating ; then stepped on one side , and pointing to the door of the room , she said , letting her visitor pas in front of her : “ Step in , my good sir. ” The little room into which the young man walked , with yellow paper on the wall , geranium and muslin curtain in the window , wa brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun . “ So the sun will shine like this _then_ too ! ” flashed a it were by chance through Raskolnikov ’ s mind , and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room , trying a far a possible to notice and remember it arrangement . But there wa nothing special in the room . The furniture , all very old and of yellow wood , consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back , an oval table in front of the sofa , a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the window , chair along the wall and two or three half-penny print in yellow frame , representing German damsel with bird in their hand -- that wa all . In the corner a light wa burning before a small ikon . Everything wa very clean ; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished ; everything shone . “ Lizaveta ’ s work , ” thought the young man . There wa not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat . “ It ’ s in the house of spiteful old widow that one find such cleanliness , ” Raskolnikov thought again , and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room , in which stood the old woman ’ s bed and chest of drawer and into which he had never looked before . These two room made up the whole flat . “ What do you want ? ” the old woman said severely , coming into the room and , a before , standing in front of him so a to look him straight in the face . “ I ’ ve brought something to pawn here , ” and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch , on the back of which wa engraved a globe ; the chain wa of steel . “ But the time is up for your last pledge . The month wa up the day before yesterday. ” “ I will bring you the interest for another month ; wait a little. ” “ But that ’ s for me to do a I please , my good sir , to wait or to sell your pledge at once. ” “ How much will you give me for the watch , Alyona Ivanovna ? ” “ You come with such trifle , my good sir , it ’ s scarcely worth anything . I gave you two rouble last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler ’ s for a rouble and a half. ” “ Give me four rouble for it , I shall redeem it , it wa my father ’ s . I shall be getting some money soon. ” “ A rouble and a half , and interest in advance , if you like ! ” “ A rouble and a half ! ” cried the young man . “ Please yourself ” -- and the old woman handed him back the watch . The young man took it , and wa so angry that he wa on the point of going away ; but checked himself at once , remembering that there wa nowhere else he could go , and that he had had another object also in coming . “ Hand it over , ” he said roughly . The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her key , and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room . The young man , left standing alone in the middle of the room , listened inquisitively , thinking . He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawer . “ It must be the top drawer , ” he reflected . “ So she carry the key in a pocket on the right . All in one bunch on a steel ring .... And there ’ s one key there , three time a big a all the others , with deep notch ; that can ’ t be the key of the chest of drawer ... then there must be some other chest or strong-box ... that ’ s worth knowing . Strong-boxes always have key like that ... but how degrading it all is. ” The old woman came back . “ Here , sir : a we say ten copeck the rouble a month , so I must take fifteen copeck from a rouble and a half for the month in advance . But for the two rouble I lent you before , you owe me now twenty copeck on the same reckoning in advance . That make thirty-five copeck altogether . So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copeck for the watch . Here it is. ” “ What ! only a rouble and fifteen copeck now ! ” “ Just so. ” The young man did not dispute it and took the money . He looked at the old woman , and wa in no hurry to get away , a though there wa still something he wanted to say or to do , but he did not himself quite know what . “ I may be bringing you something else in a day or two , Alyona Ivanovna -- a valuable thing -- silver -- a cigarette-box , a soon a I get it back from a friend ... ” he broke off in confusion . “ Well , we will talk about it then , sir. ” “ Good-bye -- are you always at home alone , your sister is not here with you ? ” He asked her a casually a possible a he went out into the passage . “ What business is she of yours , my good sir ? ” “ Oh , nothing particular , I simply asked . You are too quick .... Good-day , Alyona Ivanovna. ” Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion . This confusion became more and more intense . As he went down the stair , he even stopped short , two or three time , a though suddenly struck by some thought . When he wa in the street he cried out , “ Oh , God , how loathsome it all is ! and can I , can I possibly .... No , it ’ s nonsense , it ’ s rubbish ! ” he added resolutely . “ And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head ? What filthy thing my heart is capable of . Yes , filthy above all , disgusting , loathsome , loathsome ! -- and for a whole month I ’ ve been .... ” But no word , no exclamation , could express his agitation . The feeling of intense repulsion , which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he wa on his way to the old woman , had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness . He walked along the pavement like a drunken man , regardless of the passer-by , and jostling against them , and only came to his sens when he wa in the next street . Looking round , he noticed that he wa standing close to a tavern which wa entered by step leading from the pavement to the basement . At that instant two drunken men came out at the door , and abusing and supporting one another , they mounted the step . Without stopping to think , Raskolnikov went down the step at once . Till that moment he had never been into a tavern , but now he felt giddy and wa tormented by a burning thirst . He longed for a drink of cold beer , and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food . He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner ; ordered some beer , and eagerly drank off the first glassful . At once he felt easier ; and his thought became clear . “ All that ’ s nonsense , ” he said hopefully , “ and there is nothing in it all to worry about ! It ’ s simply physical derangement . Just a glass of beer , a piece of dry bread -- and in one moment the brain is stronger , the mind is clearer and the will is firm ! Phew , how utterly petty it all is ! ” But in spite of this scornful reflection , he wa by now looking cheerful a though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden : and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room . But even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind wa also not normal . There were few people at the time in the tavern . Besides the two drunken men he had met on the step , a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time . Their departure left the room quiet and rather empty . The person still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan , drunk , but not extremely so , sitting before a pot of beer , and his companion , a huge , stout man with a grey beard , in a short full-skirted coat . He wa very drunk : and had dropped asleep on the bench ; every now and then , he began a though in his sleep , cracking his finger , with his arm wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench , while he hummed some meaningless refrain , trying to recall some such line a these : “ His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a -- a year he -- fondly loved. ” Or suddenly waking up again : “ Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used to know. ” But no one shared his enjoyment : his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestation . There wa another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk . He wa sitting apart , now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company . He , too , appeared to be in some agitation . CHAPTER II Raskolnikov wa not used to crowd , and , a we said before , he avoided society of every sort , more especially of late . But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people . Something new seemed to be taking place within him , and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company . He wa so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest , if only for a moment , in some other world , whatever it might be ; and , in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings , he wa glad now to stay in the tavern . The master of the establishment wa in another room , but he frequently came down some step into the main room , his jaunty , tarred boot with red turn-over top coming into view each time before the rest of his person . He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat , with no cravat , and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock . At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen , and there wa another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever wa wanted . On the counter lay some sliced cucumber , some piece of dried black bread , and some fish , chopped up small , all smelling very bad . It wa insufferably close , and so heavy with the fume of spirit that five minute in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk . There are chance meeting with stranger that interest u from the first moment , before a word is spoken . Such wa the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him , who looked like a retired clerk . The young man often recalled this impression afterwards , and even ascribed it to presentiment . He looked repeatedly at the clerk , partly no doubt because the latter wa staring persistently at him , obviously anxious to enter into conversation . At the other person in the room , including the tavern-keeper , the clerk looked a though he were used to their company , and weary of it , showing a shade of condescending contempt for them a person of station and culture inferior to his own , with whom it would be useless for him to converse . He wa a man over fifty , bald and grizzled , of medium height , and stoutly built . His face , bloated from continual drinking , wa of a yellow , even greenish , tinge , with swollen eyelid out of which keen reddish eye gleamed like little chink . But there wa something very strange in him ; there wa a light in his eye a though of intense feeling -- perhaps there were even thought and intelligence , but at the same time there wa a gleam of something like madness . He wa wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat , with all it button missing except one , and that one he had buttoned , evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability . A crumpled shirt front , covered with spot and stain , protruded from his canvas waistcoat . Like a clerk , he wore no beard , nor moustache , but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush . And there wa something respectable and like an official about his manner too . But he wa restless ; he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hand dejectedly resting his ragged elbow on the stained and sticky table . At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov , and said loudly and resolutely : “ May I venture , honoured sir , to engage you in polite conversation ? Forasmuch a , though your exterior would not command respect , my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking . I have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiment , and I am besides a titular counsellor in rank . Marmeladov -- such is my name ; titular counsellor . I make bold to inquire -- have you been in the service ? ” “ No , I am studying , ” answered the young man , somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed . In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort , on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him . “ A student then , or formerly a student , ” cried the clerk . “ Just what I thought ! I ’ m a man of experience , immense experience , sir , ” and he tapped his forehead with his finger in self-approval . “ You ’ ve been a student or have attended some learned institution ! ... But allow me .... ” He got up , staggered , took up his jug and glass , and sat down beside the young man , facing him a little sideways . He wa drunk , but spoke fluently and boldly , only occasionally losing the thread of his sentence and drawling his word . He pounced upon Raskolnikov a greedily a though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month . “ Honoured sir , ” he began almost with solemnity , “ poverty is not a vice , that ’ s a true saying . Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue , and that that ’ s even truer . But beggary , honoured sir , beggary is a vice . In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul , but in beggary -- never -- no one . For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick , he is swept out with a broom , so a to make it a humiliating a possible ; and quite right , too , forasmuch a in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself . Hence the pot-house ! Honoured sir , a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating , and my wife is a very different matter from me ! Do you understand ? Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity : have you ever spent a night on a hay barge , on the Neva ? ” “ No , I have not happened to , ” answered Raskolnikov . “ What do you mean ? ” “ Well , I ’ ve just come from one and it ’ s the fifth night I ’ ve slept so .... ” He filled his glass , emptied it and paused . Bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair . It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five day . His hand , particularly , were filthy . They were fat and red , with black nail . His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest . The boy at the counter fell to sniggering . The innkeeper came down from the upper room , apparently on purpose to listen to the “ funny fellow ” and sat down at a little distance , yawning lazily , but with dignity . Evidently Marmeladov wa a familiar figure here , and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speech from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with stranger of all sort in the tavern . This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkard , and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home . Hence in the company of other drinker they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration . “ Funny fellow ! ” pronounced the innkeeper . “ And why don ’ t you work , why aren ’ t you at your duty , if you are in the service ? ” “ Why am I not at my duty , honoured sir , ” Marmeladov went on , addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov , a though it had been he who put that question to him . “ Why am I not at my duty ? Does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm I am ? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hand , and I lay drunk , didn ’ t I suffer ? Excuse me , young man , ha it ever happened to you ... hm ... well , to petition hopelessly for a loan ? ” “ Yes , it ha . But what do you mean by hopelessly ? ” “ Hopelessly in the fullest sense , when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it . You know , for instance , beforehand with positive certainty that this man , this most reputable and exemplary citizen , will on no consideration give you money ; and indeed I ask you why should he ? For he know of course that I shan ’ t pay it back . From compassion ? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keep up with modern idea explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself , and that that ’ s what is done now in England , where there is political economy . Why , I ask you , should he give it to me ? And yet though I know beforehand that he won ’ t , I set off to him and ... ” “ Why do you go ? ” put in Raskolnikov . “ Well , when one ha no one , nowhere else one can go ! For every man must have somewhere to go . Since there are time when one absolutely must go somewhere ! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket , then I had to go ... ( for my daughter ha a yellow passport ) , ” he added in parenthesis , looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man . “ No matter , sir , no matter ! ” he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boy at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled -- “ No matter , I am not confounded by the wagging of their head ; for everyone know everything about it already , and all that is secret is made open . And I accept it all , not with contempt , but with humility . So be it ! So be it ! ‘ Behold the man ! ’ Excuse me , young man , can you .... No , to put it more strongly and more distinctly ; not _can_ you but _dare_ you , looking upon me , assert that I am not a pig ? ” The young man did not answer a word . “ Well , ” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity , after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside . “ Well , so be it , I am a pig , but she is a lady ! I have the semblance of a beast , but Katerina Ivanovna , my spouse , is a person of education and an officer ’ s daughter . Granted , granted , I am a scoundrel , but she is a woman of a noble heart , full of sentiment , refined by education . And yet ... oh , if only she felt for me ! Honoured sir , honoured sir , you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him ! But Katerina Ivanovna , though she is magnanimous , she is unjust .... And yet , although I realise that when she pull my hair she only doe it out of pity -- for I repeat without being ashamed , she pull my hair , young man , ” he declared with redoubled dignity , hearing the sniggering again -- “ but , my God , if she would but once .... But no , no ! It ’ s all in vain and it ’ s no use talking ! No use talking ! For more than once , my wish did come true and more than once she ha felt for me but ... such is my fate and I am a beast by nature ! ” “ Rather ! ” assented the innkeeper yawning . Marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table . “ Such is my fate ! Do you know , sir , do you know , I have sold her very stocking for drink ? Not her shoe -- that would be more or le in the order of thing , but her stocking , her stocking I have sold for drink ! Her mohair shawl I sold for drink , a present to her long ago , her own property , not mine ; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and ha begun coughing and spitting blood too . We have three little child and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till night ; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the child , for she ’ s been used to cleanliness from a child . But her chest is weak and she ha a tendency to consumption and I feel it ! Do you suppose I don ’ t feel it ? And the more I drink the more I feel it . That ’ s why I drink too . I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink .... I drink so that I may suffer twice a much ! ” And a though in despair he laid his head down on the table . “ Young man , ” he went on , raising his head again , “ in your face I seem to read some trouble of mind . When you came in I read it , and that wa why I addressed you at once . For in unfolding to you the story of my life , I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listener , who indeed know all about it already , but I am looking for a man of feeling and education . Know then that my wife wa educated in a high-class school for the daughter of nobleman , and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personage for which she wa presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit . The medal ... well , the medal of course wa sold -- long ago , hm ... but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady . And although she is most continually on bad term with the landlady , yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honour and of the happy day that are gone . I don ’ t condemn her for it , I don ’ t blame her , for the one thing left her is recollection of the past , and all the rest is dust and ash . Yes , yes , she is a lady of spirit , proud and determined . She scrub the floor herself and ha nothing but black bread to eat , but won ’ t allow herself to be treated with disrespect . That ’ s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov ’ s rudeness to her , and so when he gave her a beating for it , she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feeling than from the blow . She wa a widow when I married her , with three child , one smaller than the other . She married her first husband , an infantry officer , for love , and ran away with him from her father ’ s house . She wa exceedingly fond of her husband ; but he gave way to card , got into trouble and with that he died . He used to beat her at the end : and although she paid him back , of which I have authentic documentary evidence , to this day she speaks of him with tear and she throw him up to me ; and I am glad , I am glad that , though only in imagination , she should think of herself a having once been happy .... And she wa left at his death with three child in a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time ; and she wa left in such hopeless poverty that , although I have seen many ups and down of all sort , I don ’ t feel equal to describing it even . Her relation had all thrown her off . And she wa proud , too , excessively proud .... And then , honoured sir , and then , I , being at the time a widower , with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife , offered her my hand , for I could not bear the sight of such suffering . You can judge the extremity of her calamity , that she , a woman of education and culture and distinguished family , should have consented to be my wife . But she did ! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hand , she married me ! For she had nowhere to turn ! Do you understand , sir , do you understand what it mean when you have absolutely nowhere to turn ? No , that you don ’ t understand yet .... And for a whole year , I performed my duty conscientiously and faithfully , and did not touch this ” ( he tapped the jug with his finger ) , “ for I have feeling . But even so , I could not please her ; and then I lost my place too , and that through no fault of mine but through change in the office ; and then I did touch it ! ... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wandering and numerous calamity in this magnificent capital , adorned with innumerable monument . Here I obtained a situation .... I obtained it and I lost it again . Do you understand ? This time it wa through my own fault I lost it : for my weakness had come out .... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel ’ s ; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with , I could not say . There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves . Dirt and disorder , a perfect Bedlam ... hm ... yes ... And meanwhile my daughter by my first wife ha grown up ; and what my daughter ha had to put up with from her step-mother whilst she wa growing up , I won ’ t speak of . For , though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feeling , she is a spirited lady , irritable and short-tempered .... Yes . But it ’ s no use going over that ! Sonia , a you may well fancy , ha had no education . I did make an effort four year ago to give her a course of geography and universal history , but a I wa not very well up in those subject myself and we had no suitable book , and what book we had ... hm , anyway we have not even those now , so all our instruction came to an end . We stopped at Cyrus of Persia . Since she ha attained year of maturity , she ha read other book of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov , Lewes ’ Physiology -- do you know it ? -- and even recounted extract from it to u : and that ’ s the whole of her education . And now may I venture to address you , honoured sir , on my own account with a private question . Do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work ? Not fifteen farthing a day can she earn , if she is respectable and ha no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant ! And what ’ s more , Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor -- have you heard of him ? -- ha not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirt she made him and drove her roughly away , stamping and reviling her , on the pretext that the shirt collar were not made like the pattern and were put in askew . And there are the little one hungry .... And Katerina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hand , her cheek flushed red , a they always are in that disease : ‘ Here you live with u , ’ say she , ‘ you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help. ’ And much she get to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little one for three day ! I wa lying at the time ... well , what of it ! I wa lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking ( she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice ... fair hair and such a pale , thin little face ) . She said : ‘ Katerina Ivanovna , am I really to do a thing like that ? ’ And Darya Frantsovna , a woman of evil character and very well known to the police , had two or three time tried to get at her through the landlady . ‘ And why not ? ’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer , ‘ you are something mighty precious to be so careful of ! ’ But don ’ t blame her , don ’ t blame her , honoured sir , don ’ t blame her ! She wa not herself when she spoke , but driven to distraction by her illness and the cry of the hungry child ; and it wa said more to wound her than anything else .... For that ’ s Katerina Ivanovna ’ s character , and when child cry , even from hunger , she fall to beating them at once . At six o ’ clock I saw Sonia get up , put on her kerchief and her cape , and go out of the room and about nine o ’ clock she came back . She walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty rouble on the table before her in silence . She did not utter a word , she did not even look at her , she simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl ( we have a shawl , made of _drap de dames_ ) , put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall ; only her little shoulder and her body kept shuddering .... And I went on lying there , just a before .... And then I saw , young man , I saw Katerina Ivanovna , in the same silence go up to Sonia ’ s little bed ; she wa on her knee all the evening kissing Sonia ’ s foot , and would not get up , and then they both fell asleep in each other ’ s arm ... together , together ... yes ... and I ... lay drunk. ” Marmeladov stopped short , a though his voice had failed him . Then he hurriedly filled his glass , drank , and cleared his throat . “ Since then , sir , ” he went on after a brief pause -- “ Since then , owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil-intentioned person -- in all which Darya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect -- since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna ha been forced to take a yellow ticket , and owing to that she is unable to go on living with u . For our landlady , Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it ( though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before ) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too ... hm .... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna wa on Sonia ’ s account . At first he wa for making up to Sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity : ‘ how , ’ said he , ‘ can a highly educated man like me live in the same room with a girl like that ? ’ And Katerina Ivanovna would not let it pas , she stood up for her ... and so that ’ s how it happened . And Sonia come to u now , mostly after dark ; she comfort Katerina Ivanovna and give her all she can .... She ha a room at the Kapernaumovs ’ the tailor , she lodge with them ; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palate too . And his wife , too , ha a cleft palate . They all live in one room , but Sonia ha her own , partitioned off .... Hm ... yes ... very poor people and all with cleft palate ... yes . Then I got up in the morning , and put on my rag , lifted up my hand to heaven and set off to his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch . His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch , do you know him ? No ? Well , then , it ’ s a man of God you don ’ t know . He is wax ... wax before the face of the Lord ; even a wax melteth ! ... His eye were dim when he heard my story . ‘ Marmeladov , once already you have deceived my expectation ... I ’ ll take you once more on my own responsibility ’ -- that ’ s what he said , ‘ remember , ’ he said , ‘ and now you can go. ’ I kissed the dust at his foot -- in thought only , for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it , being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened idea . I returned home , and when I announced that I ’ d been taken back into the service and should receive a salary , heaven , what a to-do there wa ! ... ” Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement . At that moment a whole party of reveller already drunk came in from the street , and the sound of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing “ The Hamlet ” were heard in the entry . The room wa filled with noise . The tavern-keeper and the boy were busy with the new-comers . Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrival continued his story . He appeared by now to be extremely weak , but a he became more and more drunk , he became more and more talkative . The recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him , and wa positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face . Raskolnikov listened attentively . “ That wa five week ago , sir . Yes .... As soon a Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it , mercy on u , it wa a though I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven . It used to be : you can lie like a beast , nothing but abuse . Now they were walking on tiptoe , hushing the child . ‘ Semyon Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office , he is resting , shh ! ’ They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me ! They began to get real cream for me , do you hear that ? And how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit -- eleven rouble , fifty copeck , I can ’ t guess . Boots , cotton shirt-fronts -- most magnificent , a uniform , they got up all in splendid style , for eleven rouble and a half . The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina Ivanovna had cooked two course for dinner -- soup and salt meat with horse radish -- which we had never dreamed of till then . She had not any dress ... none at all , but she got herself up a though she were going on a visit ; and not that she ’ d anything to do it with , she smartened herself up with nothing at all , she ’ d done her hair nicely , put on a clean collar of some sort , cuff , and there she wa , quite a different person , she wa younger and better looking . Sonia , my little darling , had only helped with money ‘ for the time , ’ she said , ‘ it won ’ t do for me to come and see you too often . After dark maybe when no one can see. ’ Do you hear , do you hear ? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think : though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before , she could not resist then asking her in to coffee . For two hour they were sitting , whispering together . ‘ Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again , now , and receiving a salary , ’ say she , ‘ and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him , made all the others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study. ’ Do you hear , do you hear ? ‘ To be sure , ’ say he , ‘ Semyon Zaharovitch , remembering your past service , ’ say he , ‘ and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness , since you promise now and since moreover we ’ ve got on badly without you , ’ ( do you hear , do you hear ; ) ‘ and so , ’ say he , ‘ I rely now on your word a a gentleman. ’ And all that , let me tell you , she ha simply made up for herself , and not simply out of wantonness , for the sake of bragging ; no , she belief it all herself , she amuses herself with her own fancy , upon my word she doe ! And I don ’ t blame her for it , no , I don ’ t blame her ! ... Six day ago when I brought her my first earnings in full -- twenty-three rouble forty copeck altogether -- she called me her poppet : ‘ poppet , ’ said she , ‘ my little poppet. ’ And when we were by ourselves , you understand ? You would not think me a beauty , you would not think much of me a a husband , would you ? ... Well , she pinched my cheek , ‘ my little poppet , ’ said she. ” Marmeladov broke off , tried to smile , but suddenly his chin began to twitch . He controlled himself however . The tavern , the degraded appearance of the man , the five night in the hay barge , and the pot of spirit , and yet this poignant love for his wife and child bewildered his listener . Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation . He felt vexed that he had come here . “ Honoured sir , honoured sir , ” cried Marmeladov recovering himself -- “ Oh , sir , perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you , a it doe to others , and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial detail of my home life , but it is not a laughing matter to me . For I can feel it all .... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dream of how I would arrange it all , and how I would dress all the child , and how I should give her rest , and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family .... And a great deal more .... Quite excusable , sir . Well , then , sir ” ( Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start , raised his head and gazed intently at his listener ) “ well , on the very next day after all those dream , that is to say , exactly five day ago , in the evening , by a cunning trick , like a thief in the night , I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box , took out what wa left of my earnings , how much it wa I have forgotten , and now look at me , all of you ! It ’ s the fifth day since I left home , and they are looking for me there and it ’ s the end of my employment , and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge . I exchanged it for the garment I have on ... and it ’ s the end of everything ! ” Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist , clenched his teeth , closed his eye and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table . But a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado , he glanced at Raskolnikov , laughed and said : “ This morning I went to see Sonia , I went to ask her for a pick-me-up ! He-he-he ! ” “ You don ’ t say she gave it to you ? ” cried one of the new-comers ; he shouted the word and went off into a guffaw . “ This very quart wa bought with her money , ” Marmeladov declared , addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov . “ Thirty copeck she gave me with her own hand , her last , all she had , a I saw .... She said nothing , she only looked at me without a word .... Not on earth , but up yonder ... they grieve over men , they weep , but they don ’ t blame them , they don ’ t blame them ! But it hurt more , it hurt more when they don ’ t blame ! Thirty copeck yes ! And maybe she need them now , eh ? What do you think , my dear sir ? For now she ’ s got to keep up her appearance . It cost money , that smartness , that special smartness , you know ? Do you understand ? And there ’ s pomatum , too , you see , she must have thing ; petticoat , starched one , shoe , too , real jaunty one to show off her foot when she ha to step over a puddle . Do you understand , sir , do you understand what all that smartness mean ? And here I , her own father , here I took thirty copeck of that money for a drink ! And I am drinking it ! And I have already drunk it ! Come , who will have pity on a man like me , eh ? Are you sorry for me , sir , or not ? Tell me , sir , are you sorry or not ? He-he-he ! ” He would have filled his glass , but there wa no drink left . The pot wa empty . “ What are you to be pitied for ? ” shouted the tavern-keeper who wa again near them . Shouts of laughter and even oath followed . The laughter and the oath came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk . “ To be pitied ! Why am I to be pitied ? ” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed , standing up with his arm outstretched , a though he had been only waiting for that question . “ Why am I to be pitied , you say ? Yes ! there ’ s nothing to pity me for ! I ought to be crucified , crucified on a cross , not pitied ! Crucify me , oh judge , crucify me but pity me ! And then I will go of myself to be crucified , for it ’ s not merry-making I seek but tear and tribulation ! ... Do you suppose , you that sell , that this pint of yours ha been sweet to me ? It wa tribulation I sought at the bottom of it , tear and tribulation , and have found it , and I have tasted it ; but He will pity u Who ha had pity on all men , Who ha understood all men and all thing , He is the One , He too is the judge . He will come in that day and He will ask : ‘ Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross , consumptive step-mother and for the little child of another ? Where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard , her earthly father , undismayed by his beastliness ? ’ And He will say , ‘ Come to me ! I have already forgiven thee once .... I have forgiven thee once .... Thy sin which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much .... ’ And he will forgive my Sonia , He will forgive , I know it ... I felt it in my heart when I wa with her just now ! And He will judge and will forgive all , the good and the evil , the wise and the meek .... And when He ha done with all of them , then He will summon u . ‘ You too come forth , ’ He will say , ‘ Come forth ye drunkard , come forth , ye weak one , come forth , ye child of shame ! ’ And we shall all come forth , without shame and shall stand before him . And He will say unto u , ‘ Ye are swine , made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark ; but come ye also ! ’ And the wise one and those of understanding will say , ‘ Oh Lord , why dost Thou receive these men ? ’ And He will say , ‘ This is why I receive them , oh ye wise , this is why I receive them , oh ye of understanding , that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this. ’ And He will hold out His hand to u and we shall fall down before him ... and we shall weep ... and we shall understand all thing ! Then we shall understand all ! ... and all will understand , Katerina Ivanovna even ... she will understand .... Lord , Thy kingdom come ! ” And he sank down on the bench exhausted , and helpless , looking at no one , apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought . His word had created a certain impression ; there wa a moment of silence ; but soon laughter and oath were heard again . “ That ’ s his notion ! ” “ Talked himself silly ! ” “ A fine clerk he is ! ” And so on , and so on . “ Let u go , sir , ” said Marmeladov all at once , raising his head and addressing Raskolnikov -- “ come along with me ... Kozel ’ s house , looking into the yard . I ’ m going to Katerina Ivanovna -- time I did. ” Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him . Marmeladov wa much unsteadier on his leg than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man . They had two or three hundred pace to go . The drunken man wa more and more overcome by dismay and confusion a they drew nearer the house . “ It ’ s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now , ” he muttered in agitation -- “ and that she will begin pulling my hair . What doe my hair matter ! Bother my hair ! That ’ s what I say ! Indeed it will be better if she doe begin pulling it , that ’ s not what I am afraid of ... it ’ s her eye I am afraid of ... yes , her eye ... the red on her cheek , too , frightens me ... and her breathing too .... Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe ... when they are excited ? I am frightened of the child ’ s cry , too .... For if Sonia ha not taken them food ... I don ’ t know what ’ s happened ! I don ’ t know ! But blow I am not afraid of .... Know , sir , that such blow are not a pain to me , but even an enjoyment . In fact I can ’ t get on without it .... It ’ s better so . Let her strike me , it relief her heart ... it ’ s better so ... There is the house . The house of Kozel , the cabinet-maker ... a German , well-to-do . Lead the way ! ” They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey . The staircase got darker and darker a they went up . It wa nearly eleven o ’ clock and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night , yet it wa quite dark at the top of the stair . A grimy little door at the very top of the stair stood ajar . A very poor-looking room about ten pace long wa lighted up by a candle-end ; the whole of it wa visible from the entrance . It wa all in disorder , littered up with rag of all sort , especially child ’ s garment . Across the furthest corner wa stretched a ragged sheet . Behind it probably wa the bed . There wa nothing in the room except two chair and a sofa covered with American leather , full of hole , before which stood an old deal kitchen-table , unpainted and uncovered . At the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick . It appeared that the family had a room to themselves , not part of a room , but their room wa practically a passage . The door leading to the other room , or rather cupboard , into which Amalia Lippevechsel ’ s flat wa divided stood half open , and there wa shouting , uproar and laughter within . People seemed to be playing card and drinking tea there . Words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time . Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once . She wa a rather tall , slim and graceful woman , terribly emaciated , with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheek . She wa pacing up and down in her little room , pressing her hand against her chest ; her lip were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasp . Her eye glittered a in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare . And that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression . She seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty year old and wa certainly a strange wife for Marmeladov .... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in . She seemed to be lost in thought , hearing and seeing nothing . The room wa close , but she had not opened the window ; a stench rose from the staircase , but the door on to the stair wa not closed . From the inner room cloud of tobacco smoke floated in , she kept coughing , but did not close the door . The youngest child , a girl of six , wa asleep , sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa . A boy a year older stood cry and shaking in the corner , probably he had just had a beating . Beside him stood a girl of nine year old , tall and thin , wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulder , long outgrown and barely reaching her knee . Her arm , a thin a a stick , wa round her brother ’ s neck . She wa trying to comfort him , whispering something to him , and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again . At the same time her large dark eye , which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face , were watching her mother with alarm . Marmeladov did not enter the door , but dropped on his knee in the very doorway , pushing Raskolnikov in front of him . The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him , coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for . But evidently she decided that he wa going into the next room , a he had to pas through hers to get there . Taking no further notice of him , she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knee in the doorway . “ Ah ! ” she cried out in a frenzy , “ he ha come back ! The criminal ! the monster ! ... And where is the money ? What ’ s in your pocket , show me ! And your clothes are all different ! Where are your clothes ? Where is the money ! Speak ! ” And she fell to searching him . Marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arm to facilitate the search . Not a farthing wa there . “ Where is the money ? ” she cried -- “ Mercy on u , can he have drunk it all ? There were twelve silver rouble left in the chest ! ” and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room . Marmeladov seconded her effort by meekly crawling along on his knee . “ And this is a consolation to me ! This doe not hurt me , but is a positive con-so-la-tion , ho-nou-red sir , ” he called out , shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead . The child asleep on the floor woke up , and began to cry . The boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror , almost in a fit . The eldest girl wa shaking like a leaf . “ He ’ s drunk it ! he ’ s drunk it all , ” the poor woman screamed in despair -- “ and his clothes are gone ! And they are hungry , hungry ! ” -- and wringing her hand she pointed to the child . “ Oh , accursed life ! And you , are you not ashamed ? ” -- she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov -- “ from the tavern ! Have you been drinking with him ? You have been drinking with him , too ! Go away ! ” The young man wa hastening away without uttering a word . The inner door wa thrown wide open and inquisitive face were peering in at it . Coarse laughing face with pipe and cigarette and head wearing cap thrust themselves in at the doorway . Further in could be seen figure in dressing gown flung open , in costume of unseemly scantiness , some of them with card in their hand . They were particularly diverted , when Marmeladov , dragged about by his hair , shouted that it wa a consolation to him . They even began to come into the room ; at last a sinister shrill outcry wa heard : this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day . As he went out , Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket , to snatch up the copper he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window . Afterwards on the stair , he changed his mind and would have gone back . “ What a stupid thing I ’ ve done , ” he thought to himself , “ they have Sonia and I want it myself. ” But reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it , he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging . “ Sonia want pomatum too , ” he said a he walked along the street , and he laughed malignantly -- “ such smartness cost money .... Hm ! And maybe Sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day , for there is always a risk , hunting big game ... digging for gold ... then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money . Hurrah for Sonia ! What a mine they ’ ve dug there ! And they ’ re making the most of it ! Yes , they are making the most of it ! They ’ ve wept over it and grown used to it . Man grows used to everything , the scoundrel ! ” He sank into thought . “ And what if I am wrong , ” he cried suddenly after a moment ’ s thought . “ What if man is not really a scoundrel , man in general , I mean , the whole race of mankind -- then all the rest is prejudice , simply artificial terror and there are no barrier and it ’ s all a it should be. ” CHAPTER III He waked up late next day after a broken sleep . But his sleep had not refreshed him ; he waked up bilious , irritable , ill-tempered , and looked with hatred at his room . It wa a tiny cupboard of a room about six pace in length . It had a poverty-stricken appearance with it dusty yellow paper peeling off the wall , and it wa so low-pitched that a man of more than average height wa ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling . The furniture wa in keeping with the room : there were three old chair , rather rickety ; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscript and book ; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched . A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room ; it wa once covered with chintz , but wa now in rag and served Raskolnikov a a bed . Often he went to sleep on it , a he wa , without undressing , without sheet , wrapped in his old student ’ s overcoat , with his head on one little pillow , under which he heaped up all the linen he had , clean and dirty , by way of a bolster . A little table stood in front of the sofa . It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder , but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this wa positively agreeable . He had got completely away from everyone , like a tortoise in it shell , and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation . He wa in the condition that overtakes some monomaniac entirely concentrated upon one thing . His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meal , and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her , though he went without his dinner . Nastasya , the cook and only servant , wa rather pleased at the lodger ’ s mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room , only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom . She waked him up that day . “ Get up , why are you asleep ? ” she called to him . “ It ’ s past nine , I have brought you some tea ; will you have a cup ? I should think you ’ re fairly starving ? ” Raskolnikov opened his eye , started and recognised Nastasya . “ From the landlady , eh ? ” he asked , slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa . “ From the landlady , indeed ! ” She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lump of sugar by the side of it . “ Here , Nastasya , take it please , ” he said , fumbling in his pocket ( for he had slept in his clothes ) and taking out a handful of copper -- “ run and buy me a loaf . And get me a little sausage , the cheapest , at the pork-butcher ’ s. ” “ The loaf I ’ ll fetch you this very minute , but wouldn ’ t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage ? It ’ s capital soup , yesterday ’ s . I saved it for you yesterday , but you came in late . It ’ s fine soup. ” When the soup had been brought , and he had begun upon it , Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting . She wa a country peasant-woman and a very talkative one . “ Praskovya Pavlovna mean to complain to the police about you , ” she said . He scowled . “ To the police ? What doe she want ? ” “ You don ’ t pay her money and you won ’ t turn out of the room . That ’ s what she want , to be sure. ” “ The devil , that ’ s the last straw , ” he muttered , grinding his teeth , “ no , that would not suit me ... just now . She is a fool , ” he added aloud . “ I ’ ll go and talk to her to-day. ” “ Fool she is and no mistake , just a I am . But why , if you are so clever , do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it ? One time you used to go out , you say , to teach child . But why is it you do nothing now ? ” “ I am doing ... ” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly . “ What are you doing ? ” “ Work ... ” “ What sort of work ? ” “ I am thinking , ” he answered seriously after a pause . Nastasya wa overcome with a fit of laughter . She wa given to laughter and when anything amused her , she laughed inaudibly , quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill. “ And have you made much money by your thinking ? ” she managed to articulate at last . “ One can ’ t go out to give lesson without boot . And I ’ m sick of it. ” “ Don ’ t quarrel with your bread and butter. ” “ They pay so little for lesson . What ’ s the use of a few copper ? ” he answered , reluctantly , a though replying to his own thought . “ And you want to get a fortune all at once ? ” He looked at her strangely . “ Yes , I want a fortune , ” he answered firmly , after a brief pause . “ Don ’ t be in such a hurry , you quite frighten me ! Shall I get you the loaf or not ? ” “ As you please. ” “ Ah , I forgot ! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out. ” “ A letter ? for me ! from whom ? ” “ I can ’ t say . I gave three copeck of my own to the postman for it . Will you pay me back ? ” “ Then bring it to me , for God ’ s sake , bring it , ” cried Raskolnikov greatly excited -- “ good God ! ” A minute later the letter wa brought him . That wa it : from his mother , from the province of R -- -- . He turned pale when he took it . It wa a long while since he had received a letter , but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart . “ Nastasya , leave me alone , for goodness ’ sake ; here are your three copeck , but for goodness ’ sake , make haste and go ! ” The letter wa quivering in his hand ; he did not want to open it in her presence ; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter . When Nastasya had gone out , he lifted it quickly to his lip and kissed it ; then he gazed intently at the address , the small , sloping handwriting , so dear and familiar , of the mother who had once taught him to read and write . He delayed ; he seemed almost afraid of something . At last he opened it ; it wa a thick heavy letter , weighing over two ounce , two large sheet of note paper were covered with very small handwriting . “ My dear Rodya , ” wrote his mother -- “ it ’ s two month since I last had a talk with you by letter which ha distressed me and even kept me awake at night , thinking . But I am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence . You know how I love you ; you are all we have to look to , Dounia and I , you are our all , our one hope , our one stay . What a grief it wa to me when I heard that you had given up the university some month ago , for want of mean to keep yourself and that you had lost your lesson and your other work ! How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty rouble a year pension ? The fifteen rouble I sent you four month ago I borrowed , a you know , on security of my pension , from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town . He is a kind-hearted man and wa a friend of your father ’ s too . But having given him the right to receive the pension , I had to wait till the debt wa paid off and that is only just done , so that I ’ ve been unable to send you anything all this time . But now , thank God , I believe I shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now , of which I hasten to inform you . In the first place , would you have guessed , dear Rodya , that your sister ha been living with me for the last six week and we shall not be separated in the future . Thank God , her suffering are over , but I will tell you everything in order , so that you may know just how everything ha happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you . When you wrote to me two month ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs ’ house , when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it -- what could I write in answer to you ? If I had written the whole truth to you , I dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to u , even if you had to walk all the way , for I know your character and your feeling , and you would not let your sister be insulted . I wa in despair myself , but what could I do ? And , besides , I did not know the whole truth myself then . What made it all so difficult wa that Dounia received a hundred rouble in advance when she took the place a governess in their family , on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month , and so it wa impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt . This sum ( now I can explain it all to you , my precious Rodya ) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty rouble , which you needed so terribly then and which you received from u last year . We deceived you then , writing that this money came from Dounia ’ s saving , but that wa not so , and now I tell you all about it , because , thank God , thing have suddenly changed for the better , and that you may know how Dounia love you and what a heart she ha . At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remark at table .... But I don ’ t want to go into all those painful detail , so a not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over . In short , in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna , Mr. Svidrigaïlov ’ s wife , and all the rest of the household , Dounia had a very hard time , especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov , relapsing into his old regimental habit , wa under the influence of Bacchus . And how do you think it wa all explained later on ? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning , but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt . Possibly he wa ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hope , considering his year and his being the father of a family ; and that made him angry with Dounia . And possibly , too , he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others . But at last he lost all control and had the face to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal , promising her all sort of inducement and offering , besides , to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his , or even abroad . You can imagine all she went through ! To leave her situation at once wa impossible not only on account of the money debt , but also to spare the feeling of Marfa Petrovna , whose suspicion would have been aroused : and then Dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family . And it would have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too ; that would have been inevitable . There were various other reason owing to which Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six week . You know Dounia , of course ; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she ha . Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult case she ha the fortitude to maintain her firmness . She did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me , although we were constantly in communication . It all ended very unexpectedly . Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the garden , and , putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position , threw the blame upon her , believing her to be the cause of it all . An awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden ; Marfa Petrovna went so far a to strike Dounia , refused to hear anything and wa shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave order that Dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant ’ s cart , into which they flung all her thing , her linen and her clothes , all pell-mell , without folding it up and packing it . And a heavy shower of rain came on , too , and Dounia , insulted and put to shame , had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen verst into town . Only think now what answer could I have sent to the letter I received from you two month ago and what could I have written ? I wa in despair ; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy , mortified and indignant , and yet what could you do ? You could only perhaps ruin yourself , and , besides , Dounia would not allow it ; and fill up my letter with trifle when my heart wa so full of sorrow , I could not . For a whole month the town wa full of gossip about this scandal , and it came to such a pas that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous look , whisper , and even remark made aloud about u . All our acquaintance avoided u , nobody even bowed to u in the street , and I learnt that some shopmen and clerk were intending to insult u in a shameful way , smearing the gate of our house with pitch , so that the landlord began to tell u we must leave . All this wa set going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at her in every family . She know everyone in the neighbourhood , and that month she wa continually coming into the town , and a she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affair and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband -- which is not at all right -- so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town , but over the whole surrounding district . It made me ill , but Dounia bore it better than I did , and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up ! She is an angel ! But by God ’ s mercy , our suffering were cut short : Mr. Svidrigaïlov returned to his sens and repented and , probably feeling sorry for Dounia , he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia ’ s innocence , in the form of a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him , before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden . This letter , which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov ’ s hand after her departure , she had written to refuse personal explanation and secret interview , for which he wa entreating her . In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna , reminding him that he wa the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it wa of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl , unhappy enough already . Indeed , dear Rodya , the letter wa so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I can not read it without tear . Moreover , the evidence of the servant , too , cleared Dounia ’ s reputation ; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed -- a indeed is always the case with servant . Marfa Petrovna wa completely taken aback , and ‘ again crushed ’ a she said herself to u , but she wa completely convinced of Dounia ’ s innocence . The very next day , being Sunday , she went straight to the Cathedral , knelt down and prayed with tear to Our Lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty . Then she came straight from the Cathedral to u , told u the whole story , wept bitterly and , fully penitent , she embraced Dounia and besought her to forgive her . The same morning without any delay , she went round to all the house in the town and everywhere , shedding tear , she asserted in the most flattering term Dounia ’ s innocence and the nobility of her feeling and her behavior . What wa more , she showed and read to everyone the letter in Dounia ’ s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copy of it -- which I must say I think wa superfluous . In this way she wa busy for several day in driving about the whole town , because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others . And therefore they had to take turn , so that in every house she wa expected before she arrived , and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it , even many who had heard it several time already both in their own house and in other people ’ s . In my opinion a great deal , a very great deal of all this wa unnecessary ; but that ’ s Marfa Petrovna ’ s character . Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia ’ s reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested a an indelible disgrace upon her husband , a the only person to blame , so that I really began to feel sorry for him ; it wa really treating the crazy fellow too harshly . Dounia wa at once asked to give lesson in several family , but she refused . All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which , one may say , our whole fortune are now transformed . You must know , dear Rodya , that Dounia ha a suitor and that she ha already consented to marry him . I hasten to tell you all about the matter , and though it ha been arranged without asking your consent , I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account , for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you . And you could not have judged all the fact without being on the spot . This wa how it happened . He is already of the rank of a counsellor , Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin , and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna , who ha been very active in bringing the match about . It began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance . He wa properly received , drank coffee with u and the very next day he sent u a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer . He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to Petersburg , so that every moment is precious to him . At first , of course , we were greatly surprised , a it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly . We thought and talked it over the whole day . He is a well-to-do man , to be depended upon , he ha two post in the government and ha already made his fortune . It is true that he is forty-five year old , but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by woman , and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man , only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited . But possibly that may only be the impression he make at first sight . And beware , dear Rodya , when he come to Petersburg , a he shortly will do , beware of judging him too hastily and severely , a your way is , if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight . I give you this warning , although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you . Moreover , in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudice and mistaken idea , which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards . And Pyotr Petrovitch , judging by many indication , is a thoroughly estimable man . At his first visit , indeed , he told u that he wa a practical man , but still he share , a he expressed it , many of the conviction ‘ of our most rising generation ’ and he is an opponent of all prejudice . He said a good deal more , for he seems a little conceited and like to be listened to , but this is scarcely a vice . I , of course , understood very little of it , but Dounia explained to me that , though he is not a man of great education , he is clever and seems to be good-natured . You know your sister ’ s character , Rodya . She is a resolute , sensible , patient and generous girl , but she ha a passionate heart , a I know very well . Of course , there is no great love either on his side , or on hers , but Dounia is a clever girl and ha the heart of an angel , and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care . Of that we have no good reason to doubt , though it must be admitted the matter ha been arranged in great haste . Besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier Dounia is with him . And a for some defect of character , for some habit and even certain difference of opinion -- which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriage -- Dounia ha said that , a regard all that , she relies on herself , that there is nothing to be uneasy about , and that she is ready to put up with a great deal , if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one . He struck me , for instance , at first , a rather abrupt , but that may well come from his being an outspoken man , and that is no doubt how it is . For instance , at his second visit , after he had received Dounia ’ s consent , in the course of conversation , he declared that before making Dounia ’ s acquaintance , he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation , without dowry and , above all , one who had experienced poverty , because , a he explained , a man ought not to be indebted to his wife , but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband a her benefactor . I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done , for I have forgotten his actual phrase and only remember the meaning . And , besides , it wa obviously not said of design , but slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over , but all the same it did strike me a somewhat rude , and I said so afterwards to Dounia . But Dounia wa vexed , and answered that ‘ word are not deed , ’ and that , of course , is perfectly true . Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind , and , thinking that I wa asleep , she got out of bed and wa walking up and down the room all night ; at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided . “ I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for Petersburg , where he ha a great deal of business , and he want to open a legal bureau . He ha been occupied for many year in conducting civil and commercial litigation , and only the other day he won an important case . He ha to be in Petersburg because he ha an important case before the Senate . So , Rodya dear , he may be of the greatest use to you , in every way indeed , and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you . Oh , if only this come to pas ! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it a a providential blessing . Dounia is dreaming of nothing else . We have even ventured already to drop a few word on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch . He wa cautious in his answer , and said that , of course , a he could not get on without a secretary , it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger , if only the former were fitted for the duty ( a though there could be doubt of your being fitted ! ) but then he expressed doubt whether your study at the university would leave you time for work at his office . The matter dropped for the time , but Dounia is thinking of nothing else now . She ha been in a sort of fever for the last few day , and ha already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s business , which might well be , seeing that you are a student of law . I am in complete agreement with her , Rodya , and share all her plan and hope , and think there is every probability of realising them . And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s evasiveness , very natural at present ( since he doe not know you ) , Dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband ; this she is reckoning upon . Of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plan to Pyotr Petrovitch , especially of your becoming his partner . He is a practical man and might take this very coldly , it might all seem to him simply a day-dream . Nor ha either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hope we have of his helping u to pay for your university study ; we have not spoken of it in the first place , because it will come to pas of itself , later on , and he will no doubt without wasting word offer to do it of himself , ( a though he could refuse Dounia that ) the more readily since you may by your own effort become his right hand in the office , and receive this assistance not a a charity , but a a salary earned by your own work . Dounia want to arrange it all like this and I quite agree with her . And we have not spoken of our plan for another reason , that is , because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him . When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you , he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close , for oneself , and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he make your acquaintance . Do you know , my precious Rodya , I think that perhaps for some reason ( nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though , simply for my own personal , perhaps old-womanish , fancy ) I should do better to go on living by myself , apart , than with them , after the wedding . I am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future , and if he ha said nothing about it hitherto , it is simply because it ha been taken for granted ; but I shall refuse . I have noticed more than once in my life that husband don ’ t quite get on with their mother-in-law , and I don ’ t want to be the least bit in anyone ’ s way , and for my own sake , too , would rather be quite independent , so long a I have a crust of bread of my own , and such child a you and Dounia . If possible , I would settle somewhere near you , for the most joyful piece of news , dear Rodya , I have kept for the end of my letter : know then , my dear boy , that we may , perhaps , be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three year ! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg , exactly when I don ’ t know , but very , very soon , possibly in a week . It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let u know when he ha had time to look round him in Petersburg . To suit his own arrangement he is anxious to have the ceremony a soon a possible , even before the fast of Our Lady , if it could be managed , or if that is too soon to be ready , immediately after . Oh , with what happiness I shall press you to my heart ! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you , she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone . She is an angel ! She is not writing anything to you now , and ha only told me to write that she ha so much , so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now , for a few line would tell you nothing , and it would only mean upsetting herself ; she bid me send you her love and innumerable kiss . But although we shall be meeting so soon , perhaps I shall send you a much money a I can in a day or two . Now that everyone ha heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch , my credit ha suddenly improved and I know that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five rouble on the security of my pension , so that perhaps I shall be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty rouble . I would send you more , but I am uneasy about our travelling expense ; for though Pyotr Petrovitch ha been so kind a to undertake part of the expense of the journey , that is to say , he ha taken upon himself the conveyance of our bag and big trunk ( which will be conveyed through some acquaintance of his ) , we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg , where we can ’ t be left without a halfpenny , at least for the first few day . But we have calculated it all , Dounia and I , to the last penny , and we see that the journey will not cost very much . It is only ninety verst from u to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know , so a to be in readiness ; and from there Dounia and I can travel quite comfortably third class . So that I may very likely be able to send to you not twenty-five , but thirty rouble . But enough ; I have covered two sheet already and there is no space left for more ; our whole history , but so many event have happened ! And now , my precious Rodya , I embrace you and send you a mother ’ s blessing till we meet . Love Dounia your sister , Rodya ; love her a she love you and understand that she love you beyond everything , more than herself . She is an angel and you , Rodya , you are everything to u -- our one hope , our one consolation . If only you are happy , we shall be happy . Do you still say your prayer , Rodya , and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer ? I am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-day ; If it is so , I pray for you . Remember , dear boy , how in your childhood , when your father wa living , you used to lisp your prayer at my knee , and how happy we all were in those day . Good-bye , till we meet then -- I embrace you warmly , warmly , with many kiss . “ Yours till death , “ PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV. ” Almost from the first , while he read the letter , Raskolnikov ’ s face wa wet with tear ; but when he finished it , his face wa pale and distorted and a bitter , wrathful and malignant smile wa on his lip . He laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered , pondered a long time . His heart wa beating violently , and his brain wa in a turmoil . At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that wa like a cupboard or a box . His eye and his mind craved for space . He took up his hat and went out , this time without dread of meeting anyone ; he had forgotten his dread . He turned in the direction of the Vassilyevsky Ostrov , walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect , a though hastening on some business , but he walked , a his habit wa , without noticing his way , muttering and even speaking aloud to himself , to the astonishment of the passer-by . Many of them took him to be drunk . CHAPTER IV His mother ’ s letter had been a torture to him , but a regard the chief fact in it , he had felt not one moment ’ s hesitation , even whilst he wa reading the letter . The essential question wa settled , and irrevocably settled , in his mind : “ Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr. Luzhin be damned ! ” “ The thing is perfectly clear , ” he muttered to himself , with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision . “ No , mother , no , Dounia , you won ’ t deceive me ! and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me ! I dare say ! They imagine it is arranged now and can ’ t be broken off ; but we will see whether it can or not ! A magnificent excuse : ‘ Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding ha to be in post-haste , almost by express. ’ No , Dounia , I see it all and I know what you want to say to me ; and I know too what you were thinking about , when you walked up and down all night , and what your prayer were like before the Holy Mother of Kazan who stand in mother ’ s bedroom . Bitter is the ascent to Golgotha .... Hm ... so it is finally settled ; you have determined to marry a sensible business man , Avdotya Romanovna , one who ha a fortune ( ha _already_ made his fortune , that is so much more solid and impressive ) , a man who hold two government post and who share the idea of our most rising generation , a mother writes , and who _seems_ to be kind , a Dounia herself observes . That _seems_ beat everything ! And that very Dounia for that very ‘ _seems_ ’ is marrying him ! Splendid ! splendid ! “ ... But I should like to know why mother ha written to me about ‘ our most rising generation ’ ? Simply a a descriptive touch , or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin ? Oh , the cunning of them ! I should like to know one thing more : how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since ? Was it all put into _words_ , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their mind , so that there wa no need to speak of it aloud , and better not to speak of it . Most likely it wa partly like that , from mother ’ s letter it ’ s evident : he struck her a rude _a little_ , and mother in her simplicity took her observation to Dounia . And she wa sure to be vexed and ‘ answered her angrily. ’ I should think so ! Who would not be angered when it wa quite clear without any naïve question and when it wa understood that it wa useless to discus it . And why doe she write to me , ‘ love Dounia , Rodya , and she love you more than herself ’ ? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son ? ‘ You are our one comfort , you are everything to us. ’ Oh , mother ! ” His bitterness grew more and more intense , and if he had happened to meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment , he might have murdered him . “ Hm ... yes , that ’ s true , ” he continued , pursuing the whirling idea that chased each other in his brain , “ it is true that ‘ it need time and care to get to know a man , ’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin . The chief thing is he is ‘ a man of business and _seems_ kind , ’ that wa something , wasn ’ t it , to send the bag and big box for them ! A kind man , no doubt after that ! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a peasant ’ s cart covered with sacking ( I know , I have been driven in it ) . No matter ! It is only ninety verst and then they can ‘ travel very comfortably , third class , ’ for a thousand verst ! Quite right , too . One must cut one ’ s coat according to one ’ s cloth , but what about you , Mr. Luzhin ? She is your bride .... And you must be aware that her mother ha to raise money on her pension for the journey . To be sure it ’ s a matter of business , a partnership for mutual benefit , with equal share and expense ; -- food and drink provided , but pay for your tobacco . The business man ha got the better of them , too . The luggage will cost le than their fare and very likely go for nothing . How is it that they don ’ t both see all that , or is it that they don ’ t want to see ? And they are pleased , pleased ! And to think that this is only the first blossoming , and that the real fruit are to come ! But what really matter is not the stinginess , is not the meanness , but the _tone_ of the whole thing . For that will be the tone after marriage , it ’ s a foretaste of it . And mother too , why should she be so lavish ? What will she have by the time she get to Petersburg ? Three silver rouble or two ‘ paper one ’ a _she_ say .... that old woman ... hm . What doe she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards ? She ha her reason already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the marriage , even for the first few month . The good man ha no doubt let slip something on that subject also , though mother would deny it : ‘ I shall refuse , ’ say she . On whom is she reckoning then ? Is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty rouble of pension when Afanasy Ivanovitch ’ s debt is paid ? She knit woollen shawl and embroiders cuff , ruining her old eye . And all her shawl don ’ t add more than twenty rouble a year to her hundred and twenty , I know that . So she is building all her hope all the time on Mr. Luzhin ’ s generosity ; ‘ he will offer it of himself , he will press it on me. ’ You may wait a long time for that ! That ’ s how it always is with these Schilleresque noble heart ; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them , till the last moment , they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong , and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture , yet they won ’ t face the truth till they are forced to ; the very thought of it make them shiver ; they thrust the truth away with both hand , until the man they deck out in false colour put a fool ’ s cap on them with his own hand . I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin ha any order of merit ; I bet he ha the Anna in his buttonhole and that he put it on when he go to dine with contractor or merchant . He will be sure to have it for his wedding , too ! Enough of him , confound him ! “ Well , ... mother I don ’ t wonder at , it ’ s like her , God bless her , but how could Dounia ? Dounia darling , a though I did not know you ! You were nearly twenty when I saw you last : I understood you then . Mother writes that ‘ Dounia can put up with a great deal. ’ I know that very well . I knew that two year and a half ago , and for the last two and a half year I have been thinking about it , thinking of just that , that ‘ Dounia can put up with a great deal. ’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it , she certainly can put up with a great deal . And now mother and she have taken it into their head that she can put up with Mr. Luzhin , who propounds the theory of the superiority of wife raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband ’ s bounty -- who propounds it , too , almost at the first interview . Granted that he ‘ let it slip , ’ though he is a sensible man , ( yet maybe it wa not a slip at all , but he meant to make himself clear a soon a possible ) but Dounia , Dounia ? She understands the man , of course , but she will have to live with the man . Why ! she ’ d live on black bread and water , she would not sell her soul , she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort ; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein , much le Mr. Luzhin ’ s money . No , Dounia wa not that sort when I knew her and ... she is still the same , of course ! Yes , there ’ s no denying , the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill ! It ’ s a bitter thing to spend one ’ s life a governess in the province for two hundred rouble , but I know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German master than degrade her soul , and her moral dignity , by binding herself for ever to a man whom she doe not respect and with whom she ha nothing in common -- for her own advantage . And if Mr. Luzhin had been of unalloyed gold , or one huge diamond , she would never have consented to become his legal concubine . Why is she consenting then ? What ’ s the point of it ? What ’ s the answer ? It ’ s clear enough : for herself , for her comfort , to save her life she would not sell herself , but for someone else she is doing it ! For one she love , for one she adores , she will sell herself ! That ’ s what it all amount to ; for her brother , for her mother , she will sell herself ! She will sell everything ! In such case , ‘ we overcome our moral feeling if necessary , ’ freedom , peace , conscience even , all , all are brought into the market . Let my life go , if only my dear one may be happy ! More than that , we become casuist , we learn to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves , we can persuade ourselves that it is one ’ s duty for a good object . That ’ s just like u , it ’ s a clear a daylight . It ’ s clear that Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business , and no one else . Oh , yes , she can ensure his happiness , keep him in the university , make him a partner in the office , make his whole future secure ; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on , prosperous , respected , and may even end his life a famous man ! But my mother ? It ’ s all Rodya , precious Rodya , her first born ! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter ! Oh , loving , over-partial heart ! Why , for his sake we would not shrink even from Sonia ’ s fate . Sonia , Sonia Marmeladov , the eternal victim so long a the world last . Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice , both of you ? Is it right ? Can you bear it ? Is it any use ? Is there sense in it ? And let me tell you , Dounia , Sonia ’ s life is no worse than life with Mr. Luzhin . ‘ There can be no question of love , ’ mother writes . And what if there can be no respect either , if on the contrary there is aversion , contempt , repulsion , what then ? So you will have to ‘ keep up your appearance , ’ too . Is not that so ? Do you understand what that smartness mean ? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same thing a Sonia ’ s and may be worse , viler , baser , because in your case , Dounia , it ’ s a bargain for luxury , after all , but with Sonia it ’ s simply a question of starvation . It ha to be paid for , it ha to be paid for , Dounia , this smartness . And what if it ’ s more than you can bear afterwards , if you regret it ? The bitterness , the misery , the curse , the tear hidden from all the world , for you are not a Marfa Petrovna . And how will your mother feel then ? Even now she is uneasy , she is worried , but then , when she see it all clearly ? And I ? Yes , indeed , what have you taken me for ? I won ’ t have your sacrifice , Dounia , I won ’ t have it , mother ! It shall not be , so long a I am alive , it shall not , it shall not ! I won ’ t accept it ! ” He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still . “ It shall not be ? But what are you going to do to prevent it ? You ’ ll forbid it ? And what right have you ? What can you promise them on your side to give you such a right ? Your whole life , your whole future , you will devote to them _when you have finished your study and obtained a post_ ? Yes , we have heard all that before , and that ’ s all _words_ , but now ? Now something must be done , now , do you understand that ? And what are you doing now ? You are living upon them . They borrow on their hundred rouble pension . They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs . How are you going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs , from Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin , oh , future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their life for them ? In another ten year ? In another ten year , mother will be blind with knitting shawl , maybe with weeping too . She will be worn to a shadow with fasting ; and my sister ? Imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten year ? What may happen to her during those ten year ? Can you fancy ? ” So he tortured himself , fretting himself with such question , and finding a kind of enjoyment in it . And yet all these question were not new one suddenly confronting him , they were old familiar ache . It wa long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart . Long , long ago his present anguish had it first beginning ; it had waxed and gathered strength , it had matured and concentrated , until it had taken the form of a fearful , frenzied and fantastic question , which tortured his heart and mind , clamouring insistently for an answer . Now his mother ’ s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap . It wa clear that he must not now suffer passively , worrying himself over unsolved question , but that he must do something , do it at once , and do it quickly . Anyway he must decide on something , or else ... “ Or throw up life altogether ! ” he cried suddenly , in a frenzy -- “ accept one ’ s lot humbly a it is , once for all and stifle everything in oneself , giving up all claim to activity , life and love ! ” “ Do you understand , sir , do you understand what it mean when you have absolutely nowhere to turn ? ” Marmeladov ’ s question came suddenly into his mind , “ for every man must have somewhere to turn .... ” He gave a sudden start ; another thought , that he had had yesterday , slipped back into his mind . But he did not start at the thought recurring to him , for he knew , he had _felt beforehand_ , that it must come back , he wa expecting it ; besides it wa not only yesterday ’ s thought . The difference wa that a month ago , yesterday even , the thought wa a mere dream : but now ... now it appeared not a dream at all , it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape , and he suddenly became aware of this himself .... He felt a hammering in his head , and there wa a darkness before his eye . He looked round hurriedly , he wa searching for something . He wanted to sit down and wa looking for a seat ; he wa walking along the K -- -- Boulevard . There wa a seat about a hundred pace in front of him . He walked towards it a fast he could ; but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention . Looking for the seat , he had noticed a woman walking some twenty pace in front of him , but at first he took no more notice of her than of other object that crossed his path . It had happened to him many time going home not to notice the road by which he wa going , and he wa accustomed to walk like that . But there wa at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him , that gradually his attention wa riveted upon her , at first reluctantly and , a it were , resentfully , and then more and more intently . He felt a sudden desire to find out what it wa that wa so strange about the woman . In the first place , she appeared to be a girl quite young , and she wa walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or glove , waving her arm about in an absurd way . She had on a dress of some light silky material , but put on strangely awry , not properly hooked up , and torn open at the top of the skirt , close to the waist : a great piece wa rent and hanging loose . A little kerchief wa flung about her bare throat , but lay slanting on one side . The girl wa walking unsteadily , too , stumbling and staggering from side to side . She drew Raskolnikov ’ s whole attention at last . He overtook the girl at the seat , but , on reaching it , she dropped down on it , in the corner ; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eye , apparently in extreme exhaustion . Looking at her closely , he saw at once that she wa completely drunk . It wa a strange and shocking sight . He could hardly believe that he wa not mistaken . He saw before him the face of a quite young , fair-haired girl -- sixteen , perhaps not more than fifteen , year old , pretty little face , but flushed and heavy looking and , a it were , swollen . The girl seemed hardly to know what she wa doing ; she crossed one leg over the other , lifting it indecorously , and showed every sign of being unconscious that she wa in the street . Raskolnikov did not sit down , but he felt unwilling to leave her , and stood facing her in perplexity . This boulevard wa never much frequented ; and now , at two o ’ clock , in the stifling heat , it wa quite deserted . And yet on the further side of the boulevard , about fifteen pace away , a gentleman wa standing on the edge of the pavement . He , too , would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own . He , too , had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her , but found Raskolnikov in his way . He looked angrily at him , though he tried to escape his notice , and stood impatiently biding his time , till the unwelcome man in rag should have moved away . His intention were unmistakable . The gentleman wa a plump , thickly-set man , about thirty , fashionably dressed , with a high colour , red lip and moustache . Raskolnikov felt furious ; he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way . He left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman . “ Hey ! You Svidrigaïlov ! What do you want here ? ” he shouted , clenching his fist and laughing , spluttering with rage . “ What do you mean ? ” the gentleman asked sternly , scowling in haughty astonishment . “ Get away , that ’ s what I mean. ” “ How dare you , you low fellow ! ” He raised his cane . Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fist , without reflecting that the stout gentleman wa a match for two men like himself . But at that instant someone seized him from behind , and a police constable stood between them . “ That ’ s enough , gentleman , no fighting , please , in a public place . What do you want ? Who are you ? ” he asked Raskolnikov sternly , noticing his rag . Raskolnikov looked at him intently . He had a straight-forward , sensible , soldierly face , with grey moustache and whisker . “ You are just the man I want , ” Raskolnikov cried , catching at his arm . “ I am a student , Raskolnikov .... You may a well know that too , ” he added , addressing the gentleman , “ come along , I have something to show you. ” And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat . “ Look here , hopelessly drunk , and she ha just come down the boulevard . There is no telling who and what she is , she doe not look like a professional . It ’ s more likely she ha been given drink and deceived somewhere ... for the first time ... you understand ? and they ’ ve put her out into the street like that . Look at the way her dress is torn , and the way it ha been put on : she ha been dressed by somebody , she ha not dressed herself , and dressed by unpractised hand , by a man ’ s hand ; that ’ s evident . And now look there : I don ’ t know that dandy with whom I wa going to fight , I see him for the first time , but he , too , ha seen her on the road , just now , drunk , not knowing what she is doing , and now he is very eager to get hold of her , to get her away somewhere while she is in this state ... that ’ s certain , believe me , I am not wrong . I saw him myself watching her and following her , but I prevented him , and he is just waiting for me to go away . Now he ha walked away a little , and is standing still , pretending to make a cigarette .... Think how can we keep her out of his hand , and how are we to get her home ? ” The policeman saw it all in a flash . The stout gentleman wa easy to understand , he turned to consider the girl . The policeman bent over to examine her more closely , and his face worked with genuine compassion . “ Ah , what a pity ! ” he said , shaking his head -- “ why , she is quite a child ! She ha been deceived , you can see that at once . Listen , lady , ” he began addressing her , “ where do you live ? ” The girl opened her weary and sleepy-looking eye , gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand . “ Here , ” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copeck , “ here , call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address . The only thing is to find out her address ! ” “ Missy , missy ! ” the policeman began again , taking the money . “ I ’ ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself . Where shall I take you , eh ? Where do you live ? ” “ Go away ! They won ’ t let me alone , ” the girl muttered , and once more waved her hand . “ Ach , ach , how shocking ! It ’ s shameful , missy , it ’ s a shame ! ” He shook his head again , shocked , sympathetic and indignant . “ It ’ s a difficult job , ” the policeman said to Raskolnikov , and a he did so , he looked him up and down in a rapid glance . He , too , must have seemed a strange figure to him : dressed in rag and handing him money ! “ Did you meet her far from here ? ” he asked him . “ I tell you she wa walking in front of me , staggering , just here , in the boulevard . She only just reached the seat and sank down on it. ” “ Ah , the shameful thing that are done in the world nowadays , God have mercy on u ! An innocent creature like that , drunk already ! She ha been deceived , that ’ s a sure thing . See how her dress ha been torn too .... Ah , the vice one see nowadays ! And a likely a not she belongs to gentlefolk too , poor one maybe .... There are many like that nowadays . She look refined , too , a though she were a lady , ” and he bent over her once more . Perhaps he had daughter growing up like that , “ looking like lady and refined ” with pretension to gentility and smartness .... “ The chief thing is , ” Raskolnikov persisted , “ to keep her out of this scoundrel ’ s hand ! Why should he outrage her ! It ’ s a clear a day what he is after ; ah , the brute , he is not moving off ! ” Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him . The gentleman heard him , and seemed about to fly into a rage again , but thought better of it , and confined himself to a contemptuous look . He then walked slowly another ten pace away and again halted . “ Keep her out of his hand we can , ” said the constable thoughtfully , “ if only she ’ d tell u where to take her , but a it is .... Missy , hey , missy ! ” he bent over her once more . She opened her eye fully all of a sudden , looked at him intently , a though realising something , got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come . “ Oh shameful wretch , they won ’ t let me alone ! ” she said , waving her hand again . She walked quickly , though staggering a before . The dandy followed her , but along another avenue , keeping his eye on her . “ Don ’ t be anxious , I won ’ t let him have her , ” the policeman said resolutely , and he set off after them . “ Ah , the vice one see nowadays ! ” he repeated aloud , sighing . At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov ; in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him . “ Hey , here ! ” he shouted after the policeman . The latter turned round . “ Let them be ! What is it to do with you ? Let her go ! Let him amuse himself. ” He pointed at the dandy , “ What is it to do with you ? ” The policeman wa bewildered , and stared at him open-eyed . Raskolnikov laughed . “ Well ! ” ejaculated the policeman , with a gesture of contempt , and he walked after the dandy and the girl , probably taking Raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse . “ He ha carried off my twenty copeck , ” Raskolnikov murmured angrily when he wa left alone . “ Well , let him take a much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end . And why did I want to interfere ? Is it for me to help ? Have I any right to help ? Let them devour each other alive -- what is it to me ? How did I dare to give him twenty copeck ? Were they mine ? ” In spite of those strange word he felt very wretched . He sat down on the deserted seat . His thought strayed aimlessly .... He found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment . He longed to forget himself altogether , to forget everything , and then to wake up and begin life anew .... “ Poor girl ! ” he said , looking at the empty corner where she had sat -- “ She will come to herself and weep , and then her mother will find out .... She will give her a beating , a horrible , shameful beating and then maybe , turn her out of door .... And even if she doe not , the Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it , and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there . Then there will be the hospital directly ( that ’ s always the luck of those girl with respectable mother , who go wrong on the sly ) and then ... again the hospital ... drink ... the tavern ... and more hospital , in two or three year -- a wreck , and her life over at eighteen or nineteen .... Have not I seen case like that ? And how have they been brought to it ? Why , they ’ ve all come to it like that . Ugh ! But what doe it matter ? That ’ s a it should be , they tell u . A certain percentage , they tell u , must every year go ... that way ... to the devil , I suppose , so that the rest may remain chaste , and not be interfered with . A percentage ! What splendid word they have ; they are so scientific , so consolatory .... Once you ’ ve said ‘ percentage ’ there ’ s nothing more to worry about . If we had any other word ... maybe we might feel more uneasy .... But what if Dounia were one of the percentage ! Of another one if not that one ? “ But where am I going ? ” he thought suddenly . “ Strange , I came out for something . As soon a I had read the letter I came out .... I wa going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov , to Razumihin . That ’ s what it wa ... now I remember . What for , though ? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin into my head just now ? That ’ s curious. ” He wondered at himself . Razumihin wa one of his old comrade at the university . It wa remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friend at the university ; he kept aloof from everyone , went to see no one , and did not welcome anyone who came to see him , and indeed everyone soon gave him up . He took no part in the student ’ gathering , amusement or conversation . He worked with great intensity without sparing himself , and he wa respected for this , but no one liked him . He wa very poor , and there wa a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him , a though he were keeping something to himself . He seemed to some of his comrade to look down upon them all a child , a though he were superior in development , knowledge and conviction , a though their belief and interest were beneath him . With Razumihin he had got on , or , at least , he wa more unreserved and communicative with him . Indeed it wa impossible to be on any other term with Razumihin . He wa an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth , good-natured to the point of simplicity , though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity . The better of his comrade understood this , and all were fond of him . He wa extremely intelligent , though he wa certainly rather a simpleton at time . He wa of striking appearance -- tall , thin , blackhaired and always badly shaved . He wa sometimes uproarious and wa reputed to be of great physical strength . One night , when out in a festive company , he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back . There wa no limit to his drinking power , but he could abstain from drink altogether ; he sometimes went too far in his prank ; but he could do without prank altogether . Another thing striking about Razumihin , no failure distressed him , and it seemed a though no unfavourable circumstance could crush him . He could lodge anywhere , and bear the extreme of cold and hunger . He wa very poor , and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another . He knew of no end of resource by which to earn money . He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove , and used to declare that he liked it better , because one slept more soundly in the cold . For the present he , too , had been obliged to give up the university , but it wa only for a time , and he wa working with all his might to save enough to return to his study again . Raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four month , and Razumihin did not even know his address . About two month before , they had met in the street , but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed . And though Razumihin noticed him , he passed him by , a he did not want to annoy him . CHAPTER V “ Of course , I ’ ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin ’ s to ask for work , to ask him to get me lesson or something ... ” Raskolnikov thought , “ but what help can he be to me now ? Suppose he get me lesson , suppose he share his last farthing with me , if he ha any farthing , so that I could get some boot and make myself tidy enough to give lesson ... hm ... Well and what then ? What shall I do with the few copper I earn ? That ’ s not what I want now . It ’ s really absurd for me to go to Razumihin .... ” The question why he wa now going to Razumihin agitated him even more than he wa himself aware ; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action . “ Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by mean of Razumihin alone ? ” he asked himself in perplexity . He pondered and rubbed his forehead , and , strange to say , after long musing , suddenly , a if it were spontaneously and by chance , a fantastic thought came into his head . “ Hm ... to Razumihin ’ s , ” he said all at once , calmly , a though he had reached a final determination . “ I shall go to Razumihin ’ s of course , but ... not now . I shall go to him ... on the next day after It , when It will be over and everything will begin afresh .... ” And suddenly he realised what he wa thinking . “ After It , ” he shouted , jumping up from the seat , “ but is It really going to happen ? Is it possible it really will happen ? ” He left the seat , and went off almost at a run ; he meant to turn back , homewards , but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing ; in that hole , in that awful little cupboard of his , all _this_ had for a month past been growing up in him ; and he walked on at random . His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering ; in spite of the heat he felt cold . With a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously , from some inner craving , to stare at all the object before him , a though looking for something to distract his attention ; but he did not succeed , and kept dropping every moment into brooding . When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round , he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he wa going . In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov , came out on to the Lesser Neva , crossed the bridge and turned towards the island . The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eye after the dust of the town and the huge house that hemmed him in and weighed upon him . Here there were no tavern , no stifling closeness , no stench . But soon these new pleasant sensation passed into morbid irritability . Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage , he gazed through the fence , he saw in the distance smartly dressed woman on the verandah and balcony , and child running in the garden . The flower especially caught his attention ; he gazed at them longer than at anything . He wa met , too , by luxurious carriage and by men and woman on horseback ; he watched them with curious eye and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight . Once he stood still and counted his money ; he found he had thirty copeck . “ Twenty to the policeman , three to Nastasya for the letter , so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs yesterday , ” he thought , reckoning it up for some unknown reason , but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket . He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern , and felt that he wa hungry .... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort . He finished eating it a he walked away . It wa a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once , though he only drank a wineglassful . His leg felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him . He turned homewards , but reaching Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted , turned off the road into the bush , sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep . In a morbid condition of the brain , dream often have a singular actuality , vividness , and extraordinary semblance of reality . At time monstrous image are created , but the setting and the whole picture are so truth-like and filled with detail so delicate , so unexpectedly , but so artistically consistent , that the dreamer , were he an artist like Pushkin or Turgenev even , could never have invented them in the waking state . Such sick dream always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system . Raskolnikov had a fearful dream . He dreamt he wa back in his childhood in the little town of his birth . He wa a child about seven year old , walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday . It wa a grey and heavy day , the country wa exactly a he remembered it ; indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory . The little town stood on a level flat a bare a the hand , not even a willow near it ; only in the far distance , a copse lay , a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon . A few pace beyond the last market garden stood a tavern , a big tavern , which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion , even of fear , when he walked by it with his father . There wa always a crowd there , always shouting , laughter and abuse , hideous hoarse singing and often fighting . Drunken and horrible-looking figure were hanging about the tavern . He used to cling close to his father , trembling all over when he met them . Near the tavern the road became a dusty track , the dust of which wa always black . It wa a winding road , and about a hundred pace further on , it turned to the right to the graveyard . In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three time a year with his father and mother , when a service wa held in memory of his grandmother , who had long been dead , and whom he had never seen . On these occasion they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisin stuck in it in the shape of a cross . He loved that church , the old-fashioned , unadorned ikon and the old priest with the shaking head . Near his grandmother ’ s grave , which wa marked by a stone , wa the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six month old . He did not remember him at all , but he had been told about his little brother , and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave . And now he dreamt that he wa walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard ; he wa holding his father ’ s hand and looking with dread at the tavern . A peculiar circumstance attracted his attention : there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on , there were crowd of gaily dressed townspeople , peasant woman , their husband , and riff-raff of all sort , all singing and all more or le drunk . Near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart , but a strange cart . It wa one of those big cart usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with cask of wine or other heavy good . He always liked looking at those great cart-horses , with their long mane , thick leg , and slow even pace , drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort , a though it were easier going with a load than without it . But now , strange to say , in the shaft of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast , one of those peasant ’ nag which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay , especially when the wheel were stuck in the mud or in a rut . And the peasant would beat them so cruelly , sometimes even about the nose and eye , and he felt so sorry , so sorry for them that he almost cried , and his mother always used to take him away from the window . All of a sudden there wa a great uproar of shouting , singing and the balalaïka , and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasant came out , wearing red and blue shirt and coat thrown over their shoulder . “ Get in , get in ! ” shouted one of them , a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red a a carrot . “ I ’ ll take you all , get in ! ” But at once there wa an outbreak of laughter and exclamation in the crowd . “ Take u all with a beast like that ! ” “ Why , Mikolka , are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart ? ” “ And this mare is twenty if she is a day , mate ! ” “ Get in , I ’ ll take you all , ” Mikolka shouted again , leaping first into the cart , seizing the rein and standing straight up in front . “ The bay ha gone with Matvey , ” he shouted from the cart -- “ and this brute , mate , is just breaking my heart , I feel a if I could kill her . She ’ s just eating her head off . Get in , I tell you ! I ’ ll make her gallop ! She ’ ll gallop ! ” and he picked up the whip , preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare . “ Get in ! Come along ! ” The crowd laughed . “ D ’ you hear , she ’ ll gallop ! ” “ Gallop indeed ! She ha not had a gallop in her for the last ten year ! ” “ She ’ ll jog along ! ” “ Don ’ t you mind her , mate , bring a whip each of you , get ready ! ” “ All right ! Give it to her ! ” They all clambered into Mikolka ’ s cart , laughing and making joke . Six men got in and there wa still room for more . They hauled in a fat , rosy-cheeked woman . She wa dressed in red cotton , in a pointed , beaded headdress and thick leather shoe ; she wa cracking nut and laughing . The crowd round them wa laughing too and indeed , how could they help laughing ? That wretched nag wa to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop ! Two young fellow in the cart were just getting whip ready to help Mikolka . With the cry of “ now , ” the mare tugged with all her might , but far from galloping , could scarcely move forward ; she struggled with her leg , gasping and shrinking from the blow of the three whip which were showered upon her like hail . The laughter in the cart and in the crowd wa redoubled , but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare , a though he supposed she really could gallop . “ Let me get in , too , mate , ” shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite wa aroused . “ Get in , all get in , ” cried Mikolka , “ she will draw you all . I ’ ll beat her to death ! ” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare , beside himself with fury . “ Father , father , ” he cried , “ father , what are they doing ? Father , they are beating the poor horse ! ” “ Come along , come along ! ” said his father . “ They are drunken and foolish , they are in fun ; come away , don ’ t look ! ” and he tried to draw him away , but he tore himself away from his hand , and , beside himself with horror , ran to the horse . The poor beast wa in a bad way . She wa gasping , standing still , then tugging again and almost falling . “ Beat her to death , ” cried Mikolka , “ it ’ s come to that . I ’ ll do for her ! ” “ What are you about , are you a Christian , you devil ? ” shouted an old man in the crowd . “ Did anyone ever see the like ? A wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload , ” said another . “ You ’ ll kill her , ” shouted the third . “ Don ’ t meddle ! It ’ s my property , I ’ ll do what I choose . Get in , more of you ! Get in , all of you ! I will have her go at a gallop ! ... ” All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything : the mare , roused by the shower of blow , began feebly kicking . Even the old man could not help smiling . To think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick ! Two lad in the crowd snatched up whip and ran to the mare to beat her about the rib . One ran each side . “ Hit her in the face , in the eye , in the eye , ” cried Mikolka . “ Give u a song , mate , ” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song , jingling a tambourine and whistling . The woman went on cracking nut and laughing . ... He ran beside the mare , ran in front of her , saw her being whipped across the eye , right in the eye ! He wa cry , he felt choking , his tear were streaming . One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face , he did not feel it . Wringing his hand and screaming , he rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard , who wa shaking his head in disapproval . One woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away , but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare . She wa almost at the last gasp , but began kicking once more . “ I ’ ll teach you to kick , ” Mikolka shouted ferociously . He threw down the whip , bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long , thick shaft , he took hold of one end with both hand and with an effort brandished it over the mare . “ He ’ ll crush her , ” wa shouted round him . “ He ’ ll kill her ! ” “ It ’ s my property , ” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow . There wa a sound of a heavy thud . “ Thrash her , thrash her ! Why have you stopped ? ” shouted voice in the crowd . And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare . She sank back on her haunch , but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force , tugged first on one side and then on the other , trying to move the cart . But the six whip were attacking her in all direction , and the shaft wa raised again and fell upon her a third time , then a fourth , with heavy measured blow . Mikolka wa in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow . “ She ’ s a tough one , ” wa shouted in the crowd . “ She ’ ll fall in a minute , mate , there will soon be an end of her , ” said an admiring spectator in the crowd . “ Fetch an axe to her ! Finish her off , ” shouted a third . “ I ’ ll show you ! Stand off , ” Mikolka screamed frantically ; he threw down the shaft , stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar . “ Look out , ” he shouted , and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare . The blow fell ; the mare staggered , sank back , tried to pull , but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log . “ Finish her off , ” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself , out of the cart . Several young men , also flushed with drink , seized anything they could come across -- whip , stick , pole , and ran to the dying mare . Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blow with the crowbar . The mare stretched out her head , drew a long breath and died . “ You butchered her , ” someone shouted in the crowd . “ Why wouldn ’ t she gallop then ? ” “ My property ! ” shouted Mikolka , with bloodshot eye , brandishing the bar in his hand . He stood a though regretting that he had nothing more to beat . “ No mistake about it , you are not a Christian , ” many voice were shouting in the crowd . But the poor boy , beside himself , made his way , screaming , through the crowd to the sorrel nag , put his arm round her bleeding dead head and kissed it , kissed the eye and kissed the lip .... Then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his little fist out at Mikolka . At that instant his father , who had been running after him , snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd . “ Come along , come ! Let u go home , ” he said to him . “ Father ! Why did they ... kill ... the poor horse ! ” he sobbed , but his voice broke and the word came in shriek from his panting chest . “ They are drunk .... They are brutal ... it ’ s not our business ! ” said his father . He put his arm round his father but he felt choked , choked . He tried to draw a breath , to cry out -- and woke up . He waked up , gasping for breath , his hair soaked with perspiration , and stood up in terror . “ Thank God , that wa only a dream , ” he said , sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breath . “ But what is it ? Is it some fever coming on ? Such a hideous dream ! ” He felt utterly broken : darkness and confusion were in his soul . He rested his elbow on his knee and leaned his head on his hand . “ Good God ! ” he cried , “ can it be , can it be , that I shall really take an axe , that I shall strike her on the head , split her skull open ... that I shall tread in the sticky warm blood , break the lock , steal and tremble ; hide , all spattered in the blood ... with the axe .... Good God , can it be ? ” He wa shaking like a leaf a he said this . “ But why am I going on like this ? ” he continued , sitting up again , a it were in profound amazement . “ I knew that I could never bring myself to it , so what have I been torturing myself for till now ? Yesterday , yesterday , when I went to make that ... _experiment_ , yesterday I realised completely that I could never bear to do it .... Why am I going over it again , then ? Why am I hesitating ? As I came down the stair yesterday , I said myself that it wa base , loathsome , vile , vile ... the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror . “ No , I couldn ’ t do it , I couldn ’ t do it ! Granted , granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning , that all that I have concluded this last month is clear a day , true a arithmetic .... My God ! Anyway I couldn ’ t bring myself to it ! I couldn ’ t do it , I couldn ’ t do it ! Why , why then am I still ... ? ” He rose to his foot , looked round in wonder a though surprised at finding himself in this place , and went towards the bridge . He wa pale , his eye glowed , he wa exhausted in every limb , but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily . He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him , and all at once there wa a sense of relief and peace in his soul . “ Lord , ” he prayed , “ show me my path -- I renounce that accursed ... dream of mine. ” Crossing the bridge , he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva , at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky . In spite of his weakness he wa not conscious of fatigue . It wa a though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken . Freedom , freedom ! He wa free from that spell , that sorcery , that obsession ! Later on , when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those day , minute by minute , point by point , he wa superstitiously impressed by one circumstance , which , though in itself not very exceptional , always seemed to him afterwards the predestined turning-point of his fate . He could never understand and explain to himself why , when he wa tired and worn out , when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way , he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go . It wa obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way , though not much so . It is true that it happened to him dozen of time to return home without noticing what street he passed through . But why , he wa always asking himself , why had such an important , such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market ( where he had moreover no reason to go ) at the very hour , the very minute of his life when he wa just in the very mood and in the very circumstance in which that meeting wa able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny ? As though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose ! It wa about nine o ’ clock when he crossed the Hay Market . At the table and the barrow , at the booth and the shop , all the market people were closing their establishment or clearing away and packing up their ware and , like their customer , were going home . Rag picker and costermonger of all kind were crowding round the tavern in the dirty and stinking courtyard of the Hay Market . Raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alley , when he wandered aimlessly in the street . Here his rag did not attract contemptuous attention , and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people . At the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two table set out with tape , thread , cotton handkerchief , etc . They , too , had got up to go home , but were lingering in conversation with a friend , who had just come up to them . This friend wa Lizaveta Ivanovna , or , a everyone called her , Lizaveta , the younger sister of the old pawnbroker , Alyona Ivanovna , whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his _experiment_ .... He already knew all about Lizaveta and she knew him a little too . She wa a single woman of about thirty-five , tall , clumsy , timid , submissive and almost idiotic . She wa a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister , who made her work day and night , and even beat her . She wa standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife , listening earnestly and doubtfully . They were talking of something with special warmth . The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her , he wa overcome by a strange sensation a it were of intense astonishment , though there wa nothing astonishing about this meeting . “ You could make up your mind for yourself , Lizaveta Ivanovna , ” the huckster wa saying aloud . “ Come round to-morrow about seven . They will be here too. ” “ To-morrow ? ” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully , a though unable to make up her mind . “ Upon my word , what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna , ” gabbled the huckster ’ s wife , a lively little woman . “ I look at you , you are like some little babe . And she is not your own sister either -- nothing but a step-sister and what a hand she keep over you ! ” “ But this time don ’ t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna , ” her husband interrupted ; “ that ’ s my advice , but come round to u without asking . It will be worth your while . Later on your sister herself may have a notion. ” “ Am I to come ? ” “ About seven o ’ clock to-morrow . And they will be here . You will be able to decide for yourself. ” “ And we ’ ll have a cup of tea , ” added his wife . “ All right , I ’ ll come , ” said Lizaveta , still pondering , and she began slowly moving away . Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more . He passed softly , unnoticed , trying not to miss a word . His first amazement wa followed by a thrill of horror , like a shiver running down his spine . He had learnt , he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt , that the next day at seven o ’ clock Lizaveta , the old woman ’ s sister and only companion , would be away from home and that therefore at seven o ’ clock precisely the old woman _would be left alone_ . He wa only a few step from his lodging . He went in like a man condemned to death . He thought of nothing and wa incapable of thinking ; but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought , no will , and that everything wa suddenly and irrevocably decided . Certainly , if he had to wait whole year for a suitable opportunity , he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself . In any case , it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty , with greater exactness and le risk , and without dangerous inquiry and investigation , that next day at a certain time an old woman , on whose life an attempt wa contemplated , would be at home and entirely alone . CHAPTER VI Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited Lizaveta . It wa a very ordinary matter and there wa nothing exceptional about it . A family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household good and clothes , all woman ’ s thing . As the thing would have fetched little in the market , they were looking for a dealer . This wa Lizaveta ’ s business . She undertook such job and wa frequently employed , a she wa very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it . She spoke a a rule little and , a we have said already , she wa very submissive and timid . But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late . The trace of superstition remained in him long after , and were almost ineradicable . And in all this he wa always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious , a it were , the presence of some peculiar influence and coincidence . In the previous winter a student he knew called Pokorev , who had left for Harkov , had chanced in conversation to give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna , the old pawnbroker , in case he might want to pawn anything . For a long while he did not go to her , for he had lesson and managed to get along somehow . Six week ago he had remembered the address ; he had two article that could be pawned : his father ’ s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stone , a present from his sister at parting . He decided to take the ring . When he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance , though he knew nothing special about her . He got two rouble from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home . He asked for tea , sat down and sank into deep thought . A strange idea wa pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg , and very , very much absorbed him . Almost beside him at the next table there wa sitting a student , whom he did not know and had never seen , and with him a young officer . They had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea . All at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and give him her address . This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov ; he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name . Of course it wa a chance , but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression , and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him ; the student began telling his friend various detail about Alyona Ivanovna . “ She is first-rate , ” he said . “ You can always get money from her . She is a rich a a Jew , she can give you five thousand rouble at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble . Lots of our fellow have had dealing with her . But she is an awful old harpy .... ” And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she wa , how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge wa lost ; how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on . The student chattered on , saying that she had a sister Lizaveta , whom the wretched little creature wa continually beating , and kept in complete bondage like a small child , though Lizaveta wa at least six foot high . “ There ’ s a phenomenon for you , ” cried the student and he laughed . They began talking about Lizaveta . The student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and wa continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending for him . Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her . Lizaveta wa younger than the old woman and wa her half-sister , being the child of a different mother . She wa thirty-five . She worked day and night for her sister , and besides doing the cooking and the washing , she did sewing and worked a a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned . She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister ’ s permission . The old woman had already made her will , and Lizaveta knew of it , and by this will she would not get a farthing ; nothing but the movable , chair and so on ; all the money wa left to a monastery in the province of N -- -- , that prayer might be said for her in perpetuity . Lizaveta wa of lower rank than her sister , unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance , remarkably tall with long foot that looked a if they were bent outwards . She always wore battered goatskin shoe , and wa clean in her person . What the student expressed most surprise and amusement about wa the fact that Lizaveta wa continually with child . “ But you say she is hideous ? ” observed the officer . “ Yes , she is so dark-skinned and look like a soldier dressed up , but you know she is not at all hideous . She ha such a good-natured face and eye . Strikingly so . And the proof of it is that lot of people are attracted by her . She is such a soft , gentle creature , ready to put up with anything , always willing , willing to do anything . And her smile is really very sweet. ” “ You seem to find her attractive yourself , ” laughed the officer . “ From her queerness . No , I ’ ll tell you what . I could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money , I assure you , without the faintest conscience-prick , ” the student added with warmth . The officer laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered . How strange it wa ! “ Listen , I want to ask you a serious question , ” the student said hotly . “ I wa joking of course , but look here ; on one side we have a stupid , senseless , worthless , spiteful , ailing , horrid old woman , not simply useless but doing actual mischief , who ha not an idea what she is living for herself , and who will die in a day or two in any case . You understand ? You understand ? ” “ Yes , yes , I understand , ” answered the officer , watching his excited companion attentively . “ Well , listen then . On the other side , fresh young life thrown away for want of help and by thousand , on every side ! A hundred thousand good deed could be done and helped , on that old woman ’ s money which will be buried in a monastery ! Hundreds , thousand perhaps , might be set on the right path ; dozen of family saved from destitution , from ruin , from vice , from the Lock hospital -- and all with her money . Kill her , take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all . What do you think , would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousand of good deed ? For one life thousand would be saved from corruption and decay . One death , and a hundred life in exchange -- it ’ s simple arithmetic ! Besides , what value ha the life of that sickly , stupid , ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence ! No more than the life of a louse , of a black-beetle , le in fact because the old woman is doing harm . She is wearing out the life of others ; the other day she bit Lizaveta ’ s finger out of spite ; it almost had to be amputated. ” “ Of course she doe not deserve to live , ” remarked the officer , “ but there it is , it ’ s nature. ” “ Oh , well , brother , but we have to correct and direct nature , and , but for that , we should drown in an ocean of prejudice . But for that , there would never have been a single great man . They talk of duty , conscience -- I don ’ t want to say anything against duty and conscience ; -- but the point is , what do we mean by them ? Stay , I have another question to ask you . Listen ! ” “ No , you stay , I ’ ll ask you a question . Listen ! ” “ Well ? ” “ You are talking and speechifying away , but tell me , would you kill the old woman _yourself_ ? ” “ Of course not ! I wa only arguing the justice of it .... It ’ s nothing to do with me .... ” “ But I think , if you would not do it yourself , there ’ s no justice about it .... Let u have another game. ” Raskolnikov wa violently agitated . Of course , it wa all ordinary youthful talk and thought , such a he had often heard before in different form and on different theme . But why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such idea at the very moment when his own brain wa just conceiving ... _the very same ideas_ ? And why , just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her ? This coincidence always seemed strange to him . This trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action ; a though there had really been in it something preordained , some guiding hint .... * * * * * On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring . Meanwhile it got dark ; he had no candle and , indeed , it did not occur to him to light up . He could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time . At last he wa conscious of his former fever and shivering , and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa . Soon heavy , leaden sleep came over him , a it were crushing him . He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming . Nastasya , coming into his room at ten o ’ clock the next morning , had difficulty in rousing him . She brought him in tea and bread . The tea wa again the second brew and again in her own tea-pot . “ My goodness , how he sleep ! ” she cried indignantly . “ And he is always asleep. ” He got up with an effort . His head ached , he stood up , took a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again . “ Going to sleep again , ” cried Nastasya . “ Are you ill , eh ? ” He made no reply . “ Do you want some tea ? ” “ Afterwards , ” he said with an effort , closing his eye again and turning to the wall . Nastasya stood over him . “ Perhaps he really is ill , ” she said , turned and went out . She came in again at two o ’ clock with soup . He wa lying a before . The tea stood untouched . Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him . “ Why are you lying like a log ? ” she shouted , looking at him with repulsion . He got up , and sat down again , but said nothing and stared at the floor . “ Are you ill or not ? ” asked Nastasya and again received no answer . “ You ’ d better go out and get a breath of air , ” she said after a pause . “ Will you eat it or not ? ” “ Afterwards , ” he said weakly . “ You can go. ” And he motioned her out . She remained a little longer , looked at him with compassion and went out . A few minute afterwards , he raised his eye and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup . Then he took the bread , took up a spoon and began to eat . He ate a little , three or four spoonful , without appetite , a it were mechanically . His head ached le . After his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again , but now he could not sleep ; he lay without stirring , with his face in the pillow . He wa haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams ; in one , that kept recurring , he fancied that he wa in Africa , in Egypt , in some sort of oasis . The caravan wa resting , the camel were peacefully lying down ; the palm stood all around in a complete circle ; all the party were at dinner . But he wa drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by . And it wa so cool , it wa wonderful , wonderful , blue , cold water running among the parti-coloured stone and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold .... Suddenly he heard a clock strike . He started , roused himself , raised his head , looked out of the window , and seeing how late it wa , suddenly jumped up wide awake a though someone had pulled him off the sofa . He crept on tiptoe to the door , stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase . His heart beat terribly . But all wa quiet on the stair a if everyone wa asleep .... It seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing , had prepared nothing yet .... And meanwhile perhaps it had struck six . And his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary , feverish , a it were distracted haste . But the preparation to be made were few . He concentrated all his energy on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing ; and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe . First he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat -- a work of a moment . He rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it , a worn out , old unwashed shirt . From it rag he tore a long strip , a couple of inch wide and about sixteen inch long . He folded this strip in two , took off his wide , strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material ( his only outer garment ) and began sewing the two end of the rag on the inside , under the left armhole . His hand shook a he sewed , but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again . The needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper . As for the noose , it wa a very ingenious device of his own ; the noose wa intended for the axe . It wa impossible for him to carry the axe through the street in his hand . And if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand , which would have been noticeable . Now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose , and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside . Putting his hand in his coat pocket , he could hold the end of the handle all the way , so that it did not swing ; and a the coat wa very full , a regular sack in fact , it could not be seen from outside that he wa holding something with the hand that wa in the pocket . This noose , too , he had designed a fortnight before . When he had finished with this , he thrust his hand into a little opening between his sofa and the floor , fumbled in the left corner and drew out the _pledge_ , which he had got ready long before and hidden there . This pledge wa , however , only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case . He picked up this piece of wood in one of his wandering in a courtyard where there wa some sort of a workshop . Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron , which he had also picked up at the same time in the street . Putting the iron which wa a little the smaller on the piece of wood , he fastened them very firmly , crossing and re-crossing the thread round them ; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it . This wa in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time , while she wa trying to undo the knot , and so to gain a moment . The iron strip wa added to give weight , so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the “ thing ” wa made of wood . All this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa . He had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard . “ It struck six long ago. ” “ Long ago ! My God ! ” He rushed to the door , listened , caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen step cautiously , noiselessly , like a cat . He had still the most important thing to do -- to steal the axe from the kitchen . That the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago . He had also a pocket pruning-knife , but he could not rely on the knife and still le on his own strength , and so resolved finally on the axe . We may note in passing , one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolution taken by him in the matter ; they had one strange characteristic : the more final they were , the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eye . In spite of all his agonising inward struggle , he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plan . And , indeed , if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled , and no uncertainty of any kind had remained , he would , it seems , have renounced it all a something absurd , monstrous and impossible . But a whole mass of unsettled point and uncertainty remained . As for getting the axe , that trifling business cost him no anxiety , for nothing could be easier . Nastasya wa continually out of the house , especially in the evening ; she would run in to the neighbour or to a shop , and always left the door ajar . It wa the one thing the landlady wa always scolding her about . And so , when the time came , he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe , and an hour later ( when everything wa over ) go in and put it back again . But these were doubtful point . Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back , and Nastasya had come back and wa on the spot . He would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again . But supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe , look for it , make an outcry -- that would mean suspicion or at least ground for suspicion . But those were all trifle which he had not even begun to consider , and indeed he had no time . He wa thinking of the chief point , and put off trifling detail , until _he could believe in it all_ . But that seemed utterly unattainable . So it seemed to himself at least . He could not imagine , for instance , that he would sometime leave off thinking , get up and simply go there .... Even his late experiment ( i.e . his visit with the object of a final survey of the place ) wa simply an attempt at an experiment , far from being the real thing , a though one should say “ come , let u go and try it -- why dream about it ! ” -- and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing , in a frenzy with himself . Meanwhile it would seem , a regard the moral question , that his analysis wa complete ; his casuistry had become keen a a razor , and he could not find rational objection in himself . But in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself , and doggedly , slavishly sought argument in all direction , fumbling for them , a though someone were forcing and drawing him to it . At first -- long before indeed -- he had been much occupied with one question ; why almost all crime are so badly concealed and so easily detected , and why almost all criminal leave such obvious trace ? He had come gradually to many different and curious conclusion , and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime , a in the criminal himself . Almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness , at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential . It wa his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease , developed gradually and reached it highest point just before the perpetration of the crime , continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after , according to the individual case , and then passed off like any other disease . The question whether the disease give rise to the crime , or whether the crime from it own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease , he did not yet feel able to decide . When he reached these conclusion , he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction , that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design , for the simple reason that his design wa “ not a crime .... ” We will omit all the process by mean of which he arrived at this last conclusion ; we have run too far ahead already .... We may add only that the practical , purely material difficulty of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind . “ One ha but to keep all one ’ s will-power and reason to deal with them , and they will all be overcome at the time when once one ha familiarised oneself with the minutest detail of the business .... ” But this preparation had never been begun . His final decision were what he came to trust least , and when the hour struck , it all came to pas quite differently , a it were accidentally and unexpectedly . One trifling circumstance upset his calculation , before he had even left the staircase . When he reached the landlady ’ s kitchen , the door of which wa open a usual , he glanced cautiously in to see whether , in Nastasya ’ s absence , the landlady herself wa there , or if not , whether the door to her own room wa closed , so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe . But what wa his amazement when he suddenly saw that Nastasya wa not only at home in the kitchen , but wa occupied there , taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line . Seeing him , she left off hanging the clothes , turned to him and stared at him all the time he wa passing . He turned away his eye , and walked past a though he noticed nothing . But it wa the end of everything ; he had not the axe ! He wa overwhelmed . “ What made me think , ” he reflected , a he went under the gateway , “ what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment ! Why , why , why did I assume this so certainly ? ” He wa crushed and even humiliated . He could have laughed at himself in his anger .... A dull animal rage boiled within him . He stood hesitating in the gateway . To go into the street , to go a walk for appearance ’ sake wa revolting ; to go back to his room , even more revolting . “ And what a chance I have lost for ever ! ” he muttered , standing aimlessly in the gateway , just opposite the porter ’ s little dark room , which wa also open . Suddenly he started . From the porter ’ s room , two pace away from him , something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye .... He looked about him -- nobody . He approached the room on tiptoe , went down two step into it and in a faint voice called the porter . “ Yes , not at home ! Somewhere near though , in the yard , for the door is wide open. ” He dashed to the axe ( it wa an axe ) and pulled it out from under the bench , where it lay between two chunk of wood ; at once , before going out , he made it fast in the noose , he thrust both hand into his pocket and went out of the room ; no one had noticed him ! “ When reason fails , the devil help ! ” he thought with a strange grin . This chance raised his spirit extraordinarily . He walked along quietly and sedately , without hurry , to avoid awakening suspicion . He scarcely looked at the passer-by , tried to escape looking at their face at all , and to be a little noticeable a possible . Suddenly he thought of his hat . “ Good heaven ! I had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead ! ” A curse rose from the bottom of his soul . Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop , he saw by a clock on the wall that it wa ten minute past seven . He had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round , so a to approach the house from the other side .... When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand , he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid . But he wa not very much afraid now , wa not afraid at all , indeed . His mind wa even occupied by irrelevant matter , but by nothing for long . As he passed the Yusupov garden , he wa deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountain , and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the square . By degree he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of Mars , and perhaps joined to the garden of the Mihailovsky Palace , it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town . Then he wa interested by the question why in all great town men are not simply driven by necessity , but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those part of the town where there are no garden nor fountain ; where there is most dirt and smell and all sort of nastiness . Then his own walk through the Hay Market came back to his mind , and for a moment he waked up to reality . “ What nonsense ! ” he thought , “ better think of nothing at all ! ” “ So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meet them on the way , ” flashed through his mind , but simply flashed , like lightning ; he made haste to dismiss this thought .... And by now he wa near ; here wa the house , here wa the gate . Suddenly a clock somewhere struck once . “ What ! can it be half-past seven ? Impossible , it must be fast ! ” Luckily for him , everything went well again at the gate . At that very moment , a though expressly for his benefit , a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate , completely screening him a he passed under the gateway , and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard , before he had slipped in a flash to the right . On the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling ; but no one noticed him and no one met him . Many window looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment , but he did not raise his head -- he had not the strength to . The staircase leading to the old woman ’ s room wa close by , just on the right of the gateway . He wa already on the stair .... Drawing a breath , pressing his hand against his throbbing heart , and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight , he began softly and cautiously ascending the stair , listening every minute . But the stair , too , were quite deserted ; all the door were shut ; he met no one . One flat indeed on the first floor wa wide open and painter were at work in it , but they did not glance at him . He stood still , thought a minute and went on . “ Of course it would be better if they had not been here , but ... it ’ s two storey above them. ” And there wa the fourth storey , here wa the door , here wa the flat opposite , the empty one . The flat underneath the old woman ’ s wa apparently empty also ; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off -- they had gone away ! ... He wa out of breath . For one instant the thought floated through his mind “ Shall I go back ? ” But he made no answer and began listening at the old woman ’ s door , a dead silence . Then he listened again on the staircase , listened long and intently ... then looked about him for the last time , pulled himself together , drew himself up , and once more tried the axe in the noose . “ Am I very pale ? ” he wondered . “ Am I not evidently agitated ? She is mistrustful .... Had I better wait a little longer ... till my heart leaf off thumping ? ” But his heart did not leave off . On the contrary , a though to spite him , it throbbed more and more violently . He could stand it no longer , he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang . Half a minute later he rang again , more loudly . No answer . To go on ringing wa useless and out of place . The old woman wa , of course , at home , but she wa suspicious and alone . He had some knowledge of her habit ... and once more he put his ear to the door . Either his sens were peculiarly keen ( which it is difficult to suppose ) , or the sound wa really very distinct . Anyway , he suddenly heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very door . Someone wa standing stealthily close to the lock and just a he wa doing on the outside wa secretly listening within , and seemed to have her ear to the door .... He moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding , then rang a third time , but quietly , soberly , and without impatience , Recalling it afterwards , that moment stood out in his mind vividly , distinctly , for ever ; he could not make out how he had had such cunning , for his mind wa a it were clouded at moment and he wa almost unconscious of his body .... An instant later he heard the latch unfastened . CHAPTER VII The door wa a before opened a tiny crack , and again two sharp and suspicious eye stared at him out of the darkness . Then Raskolnikov lost his head and nearly made a great mistake . Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone , and not hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicion , he took hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again . Seeing this she did not pull the door back , but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stair . Seeing that she wa standing in the doorway not allowing him to pas , he advanced straight upon her . She stepped back in alarm , tried to say something , but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eye at him . “ Good evening , Alyona Ivanovna , ” he began , trying to speak easily , but his voice would not obey him , it broke and shook . “ I have come ... I have brought something ... but we ’ d better come in ... to the light .... ” And leaving her , he passed straight into the room uninvited . The old woman ran after him ; her tongue wa unloosed . “ Good heaven ! What it is ? Who is it ? What do you want ? ” “ Why , Alyona Ivanovna , you know me ... Raskolnikov ... here , I brought you the pledge I promised the other day ... ” And he held out the pledge . The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge , but at once stared in the eye of her uninvited visitor . She looked intently , maliciously and mistrustfully . A minute passed ; he even fancied something like a sneer in her eye , a though she had already guessed everything . He felt that he wa losing his head , that he wa almost frightened , so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute , he thought he would have run away from her . “ Why do you look at me a though you did not know me ? ” he said suddenly , also with malice . “ Take it if you like , if not I ’ ll go elsewhere , I am in a hurry. ” He had not even thought of saying this , but it wa suddenly said of itself . The old woman recovered herself , and her visitor ’ s resolute tone evidently restored her confidence . “ But why , my good sir , all of a minute .... What is it ? ” she asked , looking at the pledge . “ The silver cigarette case ; I spoke of it last time , you know. ” She held out her hand . “ But how pale you are , to be sure ... and your hand are trembling too ? Have you been bathing , or what ? ” “ Fever , ” he answered abruptly . “ You can ’ t help getting pale ... if you ’ ve nothing to eat , ” he added , with difficulty articulating the word . His strength wa failing him again . But his answer sounded like the truth ; the old woman took the pledge . “ What is it ? ” she asked once more , scanning Raskolnikov intently , and weighing the pledge in her hand . “ A thing ... cigarette case .... Silver .... Look at it. ” “ It doe not seem somehow like silver .... How he ha wrapped it up ! ” Trying to untie the string and turning to the window , to the light ( all her window were shut , in spite of the stifling heat ) , she left him altogether for some second and stood with her back to him . He unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose , but did not yet take it out altogether , simply holding it in his right hand under the coat . His hand were fearfully weak , he felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden . He wa afraid he would let the axe slip and fall .... A sudden giddiness came over him . “ But what ha he tied it up like this for ? ” the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him . He had not a minute more to lose . He pulled the axe quite out , swung it with both arm , scarcely conscious of himself , and almost without effort , almost mechanically , brought the blunt side down on her head . He seemed not to use his own strength in this . But a soon a he had once brought the axe down , his strength returned to him . The old woman wa a always bareheaded . Her thin , light hair , streaked with grey , thickly smeared with grease , wa plaited in a rat ’ s tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck . As she wa so short , the blow fell on the very top of her skull . She cried out , but very faintly , and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor , raising her hand to her head . In one hand she still held “ the pledge. ” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot . The blood gushed a from an overturned glass , the body fell back . He stepped back , let it fall , and at once bent over her face ; she wa dead . Her eye seemed to be starting out of their socket , the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively . He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket ( trying to avoid the streaming body ) -- the same right-hand pocket from which she had taken the key on his last visit . He wa in full possession of his faculty , free from confusion or giddiness , but his hand were still trembling . He remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful , trying all the time not to get smeared with blood .... He pulled out the key at once , they were all , a before , in one bunch on a steel ring . He ran at once into the bedroom with them . It wa a very small room with a whole shrine of holy image . Against the other wall stood a big bed , very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt . Against a third wall wa a chest of drawer . Strange to say , so soon a he began to fit the key into the chest , so soon a he heard their jingling , a convulsive shudder passed over him . He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away . But that wa only for an instant ; it wa too late to go back . He positively smiled at himself , when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind . He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her sens . Leaving the key in the chest , he ran back to the body , snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman , but did not bring it down . There wa no doubt that she wa dead . Bending down and examining her again more closely , he saw clearly that the skull wa broken and even battered in on one side . He wa about to feel it with his finger , but drew back his hand and indeed it wa evident without that . Meanwhile there wa a perfect pool of blood . All at once he noticed a string on her neck ; he tugged at it , but the string wa strong and did not snap and besides , it wa soaked with blood . He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress , but something held it and prevented it coming . In his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body , but did not dare , and with difficulty , smearing his hand and the axe in the blood , after two minute ’ hurried effort , he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe ; he wa not mistaken -- it wa a purse . On the string were two cross , one of Cyprus wood and one of copper , and an image in silver filigree , and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring . The purse wa stuffed very full ; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it , flung the cross on the old woman ’ s body and rushed back into the bedroom , this time taking the axe with him . He wa in terrible haste , he snatched the key , and began trying them again . But he wa unsuccessful . They would not fit in the lock . It wa not so much that his hand were shaking , but that he kept making mistake ; though he saw for instance that a key wa not the right one and would not fit , still he tried to put it in . Suddenly he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notch , which wa hanging there with the small key could not possibly belong to the chest of drawer ( on his last visit this had struck him ) , but to some strong box , and that everything perhaps wa hidden in that box . He left the chest of drawer , and at once felt under the bedstead , knowing that old woman usually keep box under their bed . And so it wa ; there wa a good-sized box under the bed , at least a yard in length , with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nail . The notched key fitted at once and unlocked it . At the top , under a white sheet , wa a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin ; under it wa a silk dress , then a shawl and it seemed a though there wa nothing below but clothes . The first thing he did wa to wipe his blood-stained hand on the red brocade . “ It ’ s red , and on red blood will be le noticeable , ” the thought passed through his mind ; then he suddenly came to himself . “ Good God , am I going out of my sens ? ” he thought with terror . But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat . He made haste to turn them all over . There turned out to be various article made of gold among the clothes -- probably all pledge , unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed -- bracelet , chain , ear-rings , pin and such thing . Some were in case , others simply wrapped in newspaper , carefully and exactly folded , and tied round with tape . Without any delay , he began filling up the pocket of his trouser and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcel and case ; but he had not time to take many .... He suddenly heard step in the room where the old woman lay . He stopped short and wa still a death . But all wa quiet , so it must have been his fancy . All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry , a though someone had uttered a low broken moan . Then again dead silence for a minute or two . He sat squatting on his heel by the box and waited holding his breath . Suddenly he jumped up , seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom . In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arm . She wa gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister , white a a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out . Seeing him run out of the bedroom , she began faintly quivering all over , like a leaf , a shudder ran down her face ; she lifted her hand , opened her mouth , but still did not scream . She began slowly backing away from him into the corner , staring intently , persistently at him , but still uttered no sound , a though she could not get breath to scream . He rushed at her with the axe ; her mouth twitched piteously , a one see baby ’ mouth , when they begin to be frightened , stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming . And this hapless Lizaveta wa so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face , though that wa the most necessary and natural action at the moment , for the axe wa raised over her face . She only put up her empty left hand , but not to her face , slowly holding it out before her a though motioning him away . The axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head . She fell heavily at once . Raskolnikov completely lost his head , snatching up her bundle , dropped it again and ran into the entry . Fear gained more and more mastery over him , especially after this second , quite unexpected murder . He longed to run away from the place a fast a possible . And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly , if he had been able to realise all the difficulty of his position , the hopelessness , the hideousness and the absurdity of it , if he could have understood how many obstacle and , perhaps , crime he had still to overcome or to commit , to get out of that place and to make his way home , it is very possible that he would have flung up everything , and would have gone to give himself up , and not from fear , but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done . The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew stronger every minute . He would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world . But a sort of blankness , even dreaminess , had begun by degree to take possession of him ; at moment he forgot himself , or rather , forgot what wa of importance , and caught at trifle . Glancing , however , into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench , he bethought him of washing his hand and the axe . His hand were sticky with blood . He dropped the axe with the blade in the water , snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window , and began washing his hand in the bucket . When they were clean , he took out the axe , washed the blade and spent a long time , about three minute , washing the wood where there were spot of blood rubbing them with soap . Then he wiped it all with some linen that wa hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and then he wa a long while attentively examining the axe at the window . There wa no trace left on it , only the wood wa still damp . He carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat . Then a far a wa possible , in the dim light in the kitchen , he looked over his overcoat , his trouser and his boot . At the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stain on the boot . He wetted the rag and rubbed the boot . But he knew he wa not looking thoroughly , that there might be something quite noticeable that he wa overlooking . He stood in the middle of the room , lost in thought . Dark agonising idea rose in his mind -- the idea that he wa mad and that at that moment he wa incapable of reasoning , of protecting himself , that he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he wa now doing . “ Good God ! ” he muttered “ I must fly , fly , ” and he rushed into the entry . But here a shock of terror awaited him such a he had never known before . He stood and gazed and could not believe his eye : the door , the outer door from the stair , at which he had not long before waited and rung , wa standing unfastened and at least six inch open . No lock , no bolt , all the time , all that time ! The old woman had not shut it after him perhaps a a precaution . But , good God ! Why , he had seen Lizaveta afterwards ! And how could he , how could he have failed to reflect that she must have come in somehow ! She could not have come through the wall ! He dashed to the door and fastened the latch . “ But no , the wrong thing again ! I must get away , get away .... ” He unfastened the latch , opened the door and began listening on the staircase . He listened a long time . Somewhere far away , it might be in the gateway , two voice were loudly and shrilly shouting , quarrelling and scolding . “ What are they about ? ” He waited patiently . At last all wa still , a though suddenly cut off ; they had separated . He wa meaning to go out , but suddenly , on the floor below , a door wa noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune . “ How is it they all make such a noise ? ” flashed through his mind . Once more he closed the door and waited . At last all wa still , not a soul stirring . He wa just taking a step towards the stair when he heard fresh footstep . The step sounded very far off , at the very bottom of the stair , but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this wa someone coming _there_ , to the fourth floor , to the old woman . Why ? Were the sound somehow peculiar , significant ? The step were heavy , even and unhurried . Now _he_ had passed the first floor , now he wa mounting higher , it wa growing more and more distinct ! He could hear his heavy breathing . And now the third storey had been reached . Coming here ! And it seemed to him all at once that he wa turned to stone , that it wa like a dream in which one is being pursued , nearly caught and will be killed , and is rooted to the spot and can not even move one ’ s arm . At last when the unknown wa mounting to the fourth floor , he suddenly started , and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him . Then he took the hook and softly , noiselessly , fixed it in the catch . Instinct helped him . When he had done this , he crouched holding his breath , by the door . The unknown visitor wa by now also at the door . They were now standing opposite one another , a he had just before been standing with the old woman , when the door divided them and he wa listening . The visitor panted several time . “ He must be a big , fat man , ” thought Raskolnikov , squeezing the axe in his hand . It seemed like a dream indeed . The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly . As soon a the tin bell tinkled , Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room . For some second he listened quite seriously . The unknown rang again , waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door . Raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in it fastening , and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out . It certainly did seem possible , so violently wa he shaking it . He wa tempted to hold the fastening , but _he_ might be aware of it . A giddiness came over him again . “ I shall fall down ! ” flashed through his mind , but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once . “ What ’ s up ? Are they asleep or murdered ? D-damn them ! ” he bawled in a thick voice , “ Hey , Alyona Ivanovna , old witch ! Lizaveta Ivanovna , hey , my beauty ! open the door ! Oh , damn them ! Are they asleep or what ? ” And again , enraged , he tugged with all his might a dozen time at the bell . He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance . At this moment light hurried step were heard not far off , on the stair . Someone else wa approaching . Raskolnikov had not heard them at first . “ You don ’ t say there ’ s no one at home , ” the new-comer cried in a cheerful , ringing voice , addressing the first visitor , who still went on pulling the bell . “ Good evening , Koch. ” “ From his voice he must be quite young , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Who the devil can tell ? I ’ ve almost broken the lock , ” answered Koch . “ But how do you come to know me ? ” “ Why ! The day before yesterday I beat you three time running at billiards at Gambrinus ’ . ” “ Oh ! ” “ So they are not at home ? That ’ s queer . It ’ s awfully stupid though . Where could the old woman have gone ? I ’ ve come on business. ” “ Yes ; and I have business with her , too. ” “ Well , what can we do ? Go back , I suppose , Aie -- aie ! And I wa hoping to get some money ! ” cried the young man . “ We must give it up , of course , but what did she fix this time for ? The old witch fixed the time for me to come herself . It ’ s out of my way . And where the devil she can have got to , I can ’ t make out . She sits here from year ’ s end to year ’ s end , the old hag ; her leg are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk ! ” “ Hadn ’ t we better ask the porter ? ” “ What ? ” “ Where she ’ s gone and when she ’ ll be back. ” “ Hm .... Damn it all ! ... We might ask .... But you know she never doe go anywhere. ” And he once more tugged at the door-handle . “ Damn it all . There ’ s nothing to be done , we must go ! ” “ Stay ! ” cried the young man suddenly . “ Do you see how the door shake if you pull it ? ” “ Well ? ” “ That show it ’ s not locked , but fastened with the hook ! Do you hear how the hook clank ? ” “ Well ? ” “ Why , don ’ t you see ? That prof that one of them is at home . If they were all out , they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside . There , do you hear how the hook is clanking ? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home , don ’ t you see . So there they are sitting inside and don ’ t open the door ! ” “ Well ! And so they must be ! ” cried Koch , astonished . “ What are they about in there ? ” And he began furiously shaking the door . “ Stay ! ” cried the young man again . “ Don ’ t pull at it ! There must be something wrong .... Here , you ’ ve been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don ’ t open ! So either they ’ ve both fainted or ... ” “ What ? ” “ I tell you what . Let ’ s go fetch the porter , let him wake them up. ” “ All right. ” Both were going down . “ Stay . You stop here while I run down for the porter. ” “ What for ? ” “ Well , you ’ d better. ” “ All right. ” “ I ’ m studying the law you see ! It ’ s evident , e-vi-dent there ’ s something wrong here ! ” the young man cried hotly , and he ran downstairs . Koch remained . Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle , then gently , a though reflecting and looking about him , began touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it wa only fastened by the hook . Then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole : but the key wa in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen . Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe . He wa in a sort of delirium . He wa even making ready to fight when they should come in . While they were knocking and talking together , the idea several time occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the door . Now and then he wa tempted to swear at them , to jeer at them , while they could not open the door ! “ Only make haste ! ” wa the thought that flashed through his mind . “ But what the devil is he about ? ... ” Time wa passing , one minute , and another -- no one came . Koch began to be restless . “ What the devil ? ” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty , he , too , went down , hurrying and thumping with his heavy boot on the stair . The step died away . “ Good heaven ! What am I to do ? ” Raskolnikov unfastened the hook , opened the door -- there wa no sound . Abruptly , without any thought at all , he went out , closing the door a thoroughly a he could , and went downstairs . He had gone down three flight when he suddenly heard a loud voice below -- where could he go ! There wa nowhere to hide . He wa just going back to the flat . “ Hey there ! Catch the brute ! ” Somebody dashed out of a flat below , shouting , and rather fell than ran down the stair , bawling at the top of his voice . “ Mitka ! Mitka ! Mitka ! Mitka ! Mitka ! Blast him ! ” The shout ended in a shriek ; the last sound came from the yard ; all wa still . But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stair . There were three or four of them . He distinguished the ringing voice of the young man . “ Hey ! ” Filled with despair he went straight to meet them , feeling “ come what must ! ” If they stopped him -- all wa lost ; if they let him pas -- all wa lost too ; they would remember him . They were approaching ; they were only a flight from him -- and suddenly deliverance ! A few step from him on the right , there wa an empty flat with the door wide open , the flat on the second floor where the painter had been at work , and which , a though for his benefit , they had just left . It wa they , no doubt , who had just run down , shouting . The floor had only just been painted , in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brush . In one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and only in the nick of time ; they had already reached the landing . Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor , talking loudly . He waited , went out on tiptoe and ran down the stair . No one wa on the stair , nor in the gateway . He passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the street . He knew , he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat , that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked , a the door had just been fastened , that by now they were looking at the body , that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there , and had succeeded in hiding somewhere , slipping by them and escaping . They would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat , while they were going upstairs . And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much , though the next turning wa still nearly a hundred yard away . “ Should he slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street ? No , hopeless ! Should he fling away the axe ? Should he take a cab ? Hopeless , hopeless ! ” At last he reached the turning . He turned down it more dead than alive . Here he wa half way to safety , and he understood it ; it wa le risky because there wa a great crowd of people , and he wa lost in it like a grain of sand . But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely move . Perspiration ran down him in drop , his neck wa all wet . “ My word , he ha been going it ! ” someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank . He wa only dimly conscious of himself now , and the farther he went the worse it wa . He remembered however , that on coming out on to the canal bank , he wa alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous , and he had thought of turning back . Though he wa almost falling from fatigue , he went a long way round so a to get home from quite a different direction . He wa not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house ! He wa already on the staircase before he recollected the axe . And yet he had a very grave problem before him , to put it back and to escape observation a far a possible in doing so . He wa of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all , but to drop it later on in somebody ’ s yard . But it all happened fortunately , the door of the porter ’ s room wa closed but not locked , so that it seemed most likely that the porter wa at home . But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the door and opened it . If the porter had asked him , “ What do you want ? ” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe . But again the porter wa not at home , and he succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench , and even covering it with the chunk of wood a before . He met no one , not a soul , afterwards on the way to his room ; the landlady ’ s door wa shut . When he wa in his room , he flung himself on the sofa just a he wa -- he did not sleep , but sank into blank forgetfulness . If anyone had come into his room then , he would have jumped up at once and screamed . Scraps and shred of thought were simply swarming in his brain , but he could not catch at one , he could not rest on one , in spite of all his effort .... PART II CHAPTER I So he lay a very long while . Now and then he seemed to wake up , and at such moment he noticed that it wa far into the night , but it did not occur to him to get up . At last he noticed that it wa beginning to get light . He wa lying on his back , still dazed from his recent oblivion . Fearful , despairing cry rose shrilly from the street , sound which he heard every night , indeed , under his window after two o ’ clock . They woke him up now . “ Ah ! the drunken men are coming out of the tavern , ” he thought , “ it ’ s past two o ’ clock , ” and at once he leaped up , a though someone had pulled him from the sofa . “ What ! Past two o ’ clock ! ” He sat down on the sofa -- and instantly recollected everything ! All at once , in one flash , he recollected everything . For the first moment he thought he wa going mad . A dreadful chill came over him ; but the chill wa from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep . Now he wa suddenly taken with violent shivering , so that his teeth chattered and all his limb were shaking . He opened the door and began listening -- everything in the house wa asleep . With amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him , wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the door , and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing , without even taking his hat off . It had fallen off and wa lying on the floor near his pillow . “ If anyone had come in , what would he have thought ? That I ’ m drunk but ... ” He rushed to the window . There wa light enough , and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot , all his clothes ; were there no trace ? But there wa no doing it like that ; shivering with cold , he began taking off everything and looking over again . He turned everything over to the last thread and rag , and mistrusting himself , went through his search three time . But there seemed to be nothing , no trace , except in one place , where some thick drop of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trouser . He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed thread . There seemed to be nothing more . Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the thing he had taken out of the old woman ’ s box were still in his pocket ! He had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them ! He had not even thought of them while he wa examining his clothes ! What next ? Instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table . When he had pulled out everything , and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there wa nothing left , he carried the whole heap to the corner . The paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatter . He began stuffing all the thing into the hole under the paper : “ They ’ re in ! All out of sight , and the purse too ! ” he thought gleefully , getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever . Suddenly he shuddered all over with horror ; “ My God ! ” he whispered in despair : “ what ’ s the matter with me ? Is that hidden ? Is that the way to hide thing ? ” He had not reckoned on having trinket to hide . He had only thought of money , and so had not prepared a hiding-place . “ But now , now , what am I glad of ? ” he thought , “ Is that hiding thing ? My reason ’ s deserting me -- simply ! ” He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and wa at once shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering . Mechanically he drew from a chair beside him his old student ’ s winter coat , which wa still warm though almost in rag , covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium . He lost consciousness . Not more than five minute had passed when he jumped up a second time , and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again . “ How could I go to sleep again with nothing done ? Yes , yes ; I have not taken the loop off the armhole ! I forgot it , forgot a thing like that ! Such a piece of evidence ! ” He pulled off the noose , hurriedly cut it to piece and threw the bit among his linen under the pillow . “ Pieces of torn linen couldn ’ t rouse suspicion , whatever happened ; I think not , I think not , any way ! ” he repeated , standing in the middle of the room , and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about him again , at the floor and everywhere , trying to make sure he had not forgotten anything . The conviction that all his faculty , even memory , and the simplest power of reflection were failing him , began to be an insufferable torture . “ Surely it isn ’ t beginning already ! Surely it isn ’ t my punishment coming upon me ? It is ! ” The frayed rag he had cut off his trouser were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room , where anyone coming in would see them ! “ What is the matter with me ! ” he cried again , like one distraught . Then a strange idea entered his head ; that , perhaps , all his clothes were covered with blood , that , perhaps , there were a great many stain , but that he did not see them , did not notice them because his perception were failing , were going to piece ... his reason wa clouded .... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the purse too . “ Ah ! Then there must be blood on the pocket too , for I put the wet purse in my pocket ! ” In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and , yes ! -- there were trace , stain on the lining of the pocket ! “ So my reason ha not quite deserted me , so I still have some sense and memory , since I guessed it of myself , ” he thought triumphantly , with a deep sigh of relief ; “ it ’ s simply the weakness of fever , a moment ’ s delirium , ” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his trouser . At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot ; on the sock which poked out from the boot , he fancied there were trace ! He flung off his boot ; “ trace indeed ! The tip of the sock wa soaked with blood ; ” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool .... “ But what am I to do with this now ? Where am I to put the sock and rag and pocket ? ” He gathered them all up in his hand and stood in the middle of the room . “ In the stove ? But they would ransack the stove first of all . Burn them ? But what can I burn them with ? There are no match even . No , better go out and throw it all away somewhere . Yes , better throw it away , ” he repeated , sitting down on the sofa again , “ and at once , this minute , without lingering ... ” But his head sank on the pillow instead . Again the unbearable icy shivering came over him ; again he drew his coat over him . And for a long while , for some hour , he wa haunted by the impulse to “ go off somewhere at once , this moment , and fling it all away , so that it may be out of sight and done with , at once , at once ! ” Several time he tried to rise from the sofa , but could not . He wa thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door . “ Open , do , are you dead or alive ? He keep sleeping here ! ” shouted Nastasya , banging with her fist on the door . “ For whole day together he ’ s snoring here like a dog ! A dog he is too . Open I tell you . It ’ s past ten. ” “ Maybe he ’ s not at home , ” said a man ’ s voice . “ Ha ! that ’ s the porter ’ s voice .... What doe he want ? ” He jumped up and sat on the sofa . The beating of his heart wa a positive pain . “ Then who can have latched the door ? ” retorted Nastasya . “ He ’ s taken to bolting himself in ! As if he were worth stealing ! Open , you stupid , wake up ! ” “ What do they want ? Why the porter ? All ’ s discovered . Resist or open ? Come what may ! ... ” He half rose , stooped forward and unlatched the door . His room wa so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed . Yes ; the porter and Nastasya were standing there . Nastasya stared at him in a strange way . He glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter , who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax . “ A notice from the office , ” he announced , a he gave him the paper . “ From what office ? ” “ A summons to the police office , of course . You know which office. ” “ To the police ? ... What for ? ... ” “ How can I tell ? You ’ re sent for , so you go. ” The man looked at him attentively , looked round the room and turned to go away . “ He ’ s downright ill ! ” observed Nastasya , not taking her eye off him . The porter turned his head for a moment . “ He ’ s been in a fever since yesterday , ” she added . Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hand , without opening it . “ Don ’ t you get up then , ” Nastasya went on compassionately , seeing that he wa letting his foot down from the sofa . “ You ’ re ill , and so don ’ t go ; there ’ s no such hurry . What have you got there ? ” He looked ; in his right hand he held the shred he had cut from his trouser , the sock , and the rag of the pocket . So he had been asleep with them in his hand . Afterwards reflecting upon it , he remembered that half waking up in his fever , he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so fallen asleep again . “ Look at the rag he ’ s collected and sleep with them , a though he ha got hold of a treasure ... ” And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle . Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his eye intently upon her . Far a he wa from being capable of rational reflection at that moment , he felt that no one would behave like that with a person who wa going to be arrested . “ But ... the police ? ” “ You ’ d better have some tea ! Yes ? I ’ ll bring it , there ’ s some left. ” “ No ... I ’ m going ; I ’ ll go at once , ” he muttered , getting on to his foot . “ Why , you ’ ll never get downstairs ! ” “ Yes , I ’ ll go. ” “ As you please. ” She followed the porter out . At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rag . “ There are stain , but not very noticeable ; all covered with dirt , and rubbed and already discoloured . No one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything . Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed , thank God ! ” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading ; he wa a long while reading , before he understood . It wa an ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent . “ But when ha such a thing happened ? I never have anything to do with the police ! And why just to-day ? ” he thought in agonising bewilderment . “ Good God , only get it over soon ! ” He wa flinging himself on his knee to pray , but broke into laughter -- not at the idea of prayer , but at himself . He began , hurriedly dressing . “ If I ’ m lost , I am lost , I don ’ t care ! Shall I put the sock on ? ” he suddenly wondered , “ it will get dustier still and the trace will be gone. ” But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror . He pulled it off , but reflecting that he had no other sock , he picked it up and put it on again -- and again he laughed . “ That ’ s all conventional , that ’ s all relative , merely a way of looking at it , ” he thought in a flash , but only on the top surface of his mind , while he wa shuddering all over , “ there , I ’ ve got it on ! I have finished by getting it on ! ” But his laughter wa quickly followed by despair . “ No , it ’ s too much for me ... ” he thought . His leg shook . “ From fear , ” he muttered . His head swam and ached with fever . “ It ’ s a trick ! They want to decoy me there and confound me over everything , ” he mused , a he went out on to the stair -- “ the worst of it is I ’ m almost light-headed ... I may blurt out something stupid ... ” On the stair he remembered that he wa leaving all the thing just a they were in the hole in the wall , “ and very likely , it ’ s on purpose to search when I ’ m out , ” he thought , and stopped short . But he wa possessed by such despair , such cynicism of misery , if one may so call it , that with a wave of his hand he went on . “ Only to get it over ! ” In the street the heat wa insufferable again ; not a drop of rain had fallen all those day . Again dust , brick and mortar , again the stench from the shop and pot-houses , again the drunken men , the Finnish pedlar and half-broken-down cab . The sun shone straight in his eye , so that it hurt him to look out of them , and he felt his head going round -- a a man in a fever is apt to feel when he come out into the street on a bright sunny day . When he reached the turning into _the_ street , in an agony of trepidation he looked down it ... at _the_ house ... and at once averted his eye . “ If they question me , perhaps I ’ ll simply tell , ” he thought , a he drew near the police-station . The police-station wa about a quarter of a mile off . It had lately been moved to new room on the fourth floor of a new house . He had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago . Turning in at the gateway , he saw on the right a flight of stair which a peasant wa mounting with a book in his hand . “ A house-porter , no doubt ; so then , the office is here , ” and he began ascending the stair on the chance . He did not want to ask question of anyone . “ I ’ ll go in , fall on my knee , and confess everything ... ” he thought , a he reached the fourth floor . The staircase wa steep , narrow and all sloppy with dirty water . The kitchen of the flat opened on to the stair and stood open almost the whole day . So there wa a fearful smell and heat . The staircase wa crowded with porter going up and down with their book under their arm , policeman , and person of all sort and both sex . The door of the office , too , stood wide open . Peasants stood waiting within . There , too , the heat wa stifling and there wa a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated room . After waiting a little , he decided to move forward into the next room . All the room were small and low-pitched . A fearful impatience drew him on and on . No one paid attention to him . In the second room some clerk sat writing , dressed hardly better than he wa , and rather a queer-looking set . He went up to one of them . “ What is it ? ” He showed the notice he had received . “ You are a student ? ” the man asked , glancing at the notice . “ Yes , formerly a student. ” The clerk looked at him , but without the slightest interest . He wa a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye . “ There would be no getting anything out of him , because he ha no interest in anything , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Go in there to the head clerk , ” said the clerk , pointing towards the furthest room . He went into that room -- the fourth in order ; it wa a small room and packed full of people , rather better dressed than in the outer room . Among them were two lady . One , poorly dressed in mourning , sat at the table opposite the chief clerk , writing something at his dictation . The other , a very stout , buxom woman with a purplish-red , blotchy face , excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom a big a a saucer , wa standing on one side , apparently waiting for something . Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk . The latter glanced at it , said : “ Wait a minute , ” and went on attending to the lady in mourning . He breathed more freely . “ It can ’ t be that ! ” By degree he began to regain confidence , he kept urging himself to have courage and be calm . “ Some foolishness , some trifling carelessness , and I may betray myself ! Hm ... it ’ s a pity there ’ s no air here , ” he added , “ it ’ s stifling .... It make one ’ s head dizzier than ever ... and one ’ s mind too ... ” He wa conscious of a terrible inner turmoil . He wa afraid of losing his self-control ; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it , something quite irrelevant , but he could not succeed in this at all . Yet the head clerk greatly interested him , he kept hoping to see through him and guess something from his face . He wa a very young man , about two and twenty , with a dark mobile face that looked older than his year . He wa fashionably dressed and foppish , with his hair parted in the middle , well combed and pomaded , and wore a number of ring on his well-scrubbed finger and a gold chain on his waistcoat . He said a couple of word in French to a foreigner who wa in the room , and said them fairly correctly . “ Luise Ivanovna , you can sit down , ” he said casually to the gaily-dressed , purple-faced lady , who wa still standing a though not venturing to sit down , though there wa a chair beside her . “ Ich danke , ” said the latter , and softly , with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair . Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room . She smelt of scent . But she wa obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent ; and though her smile wa impudent a well a cringing , it betrayed evident uneasiness . The lady in mourning had done at last , and got up . All at once , with some noise , an officer walked in very jauntily , with a peculiar swing of his shoulder at each step . He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy-chair . The small lady positively skipped from her seat on seeing him , and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy ; but the officer took not the smallest notice of her , and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence . He wa the assistant superintendent . He had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face , and extremely small feature , expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence . He looked askance and rather indignantly at Raskolnikov ; he wa so very badly dressed , and in spite of his humiliating position , his bearing wa by no mean in keeping with his clothes . Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him , so that he felt positively affronted . “ What do you want ? ” he shouted , apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow wa not annihilated by the majesty of his glance . “ I wa summoned ... by a notice ... ” Raskolnikov faltered . “ For the recovery of money due , from _the student_ , ” the head clerk interfered hurriedly , tearing himself from his paper . “ Here ! ” and he flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place . “ Read that ! ” “ Money ? What money ? ” thought Raskolnikov , “ but ... then ... it ’ s certainly not _that_. ” And he trembled with joy . He felt sudden intense indescribable relief . A load wa lifted from his back . “ And pray , what time were you directed to appear , sir ? ” shouted the assistant superintendent , seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved . “ You are told to come at nine , and now it ’ s twelve ! ” “ The notice wa only brought me a quarter of an hour ago , ” Raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder . To his own surprise he , too , grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it . “ And it ’ s enough that I have come here ill with fever. ” “ Kindly refrain from shouting ! ” “ I ’ m not shouting , I ’ m speaking very quietly , it ’ s you who are shouting at me . I ’ m a student , and allow no one to shout at me. ” The assistant superintendent wa so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately . He leaped up from his seat . “ Be silent ! You are in a government office . Don ’ t be impudent , sir ! ” “ You ’ re in a government office , too , ” cried Raskolnikov , “ and you ’ re smoking a cigarette a well a shouting , so you are showing disrespect to all of us. ” He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this . The head clerk looked at him with a smile . The angry assistant superintendent wa obviously disconcerted . “ That ’ s not your business ! ” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness . “ Kindly make the declaration demanded of you . Show him . Alexandr Grigorievitch . There is a complaint against you ! You don ’ t pay your debt ! You ’ re a fine bird ! ” But Raskolnikov wa not listening now ; he had eagerly clutched at the paper , in haste to find an explanation . He read it once , and a second time , and still did not understand . “ What is this ? ” he asked the head clerk . “ It is for the recovery of money on an I O U , a writ . You must either pay it , with all expense , cost and so on , or give a written declaration when you can pay it , and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment , and nor to sell or conceal your property . The creditor is at liberty to sell your property , and proceed against you according to the law. ” “ But I ... am not in debt to anyone ! ” “ That ’ s not our business . Here , an I O U for a hundred and fifteen rouble , legally attested , and due for payment , ha been brought u for recovery , given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn , nine month ago , and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov . We therefore summon you , hereupon. ” “ But she is my landlady ! ” “ And what if she is your landlady ? ” The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion , and at the same time with a certain triumph , a at a novice under fire for the first time -- a though he would say : “ Well , how do you feel now ? ” But what did he care now for an I O U , for a writ of recovery ! Was that worth worrying about now , wa it worth attention even ! He stood , he read , he listened , he answered , he even asked question himself , but all mechanically . The triumphant sense of security , of deliverance from overwhelming danger , that wa what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for the future , without analysis , without supposition or surmise , without doubt and without questioning . It wa an instant of full , direct , purely instinctive joy . But at that very moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the office . The assistant superintendent , still shaken by Raskolnikov ’ s disrespect , still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity , pounced on the unfortunate smart lady , who had been gazing at him ever since he came in with an exceedingly silly smile . “ You shameful hussy ! ” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice . ( The lady in mourning had left the office . ) “ What wa going on at your house last night ? Eh ! A disgrace again , you ’ re a scandal to the whole street . Fighting and drinking again . Do you want the house of correction ? Why , I have warned you ten time over that I would not let you off the eleventh ! And here you are again , again , you ... you ... ! ” The paper fell out of Raskolnikov ’ s hand , and he looked wildly at the smart lady who wa so unceremoniously treated . But he soon saw what it meant , and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal . He listened with pleasure , so that he longed to laugh and laugh ... all his nerve were on edge . “ Ilya Petrovitch ! ” the head clerk wa beginning anxiously , but stopped short , for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force . As for the smart lady , at first she positively trembled before the storm . But , strange to say , the more numerous and violent the term of abuse became , the more amiable she looked , and the more seductive the smile she lavished on the terrible assistant . She moved uneasily , and curtsied incessantly , waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her word : and at last she found it . “ There wa no sort of noise or fighting in my house , Mr. Captain , ” she pattered all at once , like pea dropping , speaking Russian confidently , though with a strong German accent , “ and no sort of scandal , and his honour came drunk , and it ’ s the whole truth I am telling , Mr. Captain , and I am not to blame .... Mine is an honourable house , Mr. Captain , and honourable behaviour , Mr. Captain , and I always , always dislike any scandal myself . But he came quite tipsy , and asked for three bottle again , and then he lifted up one leg , and began playing the pianoforte with one foot , and that is not at all right in an honourable house , and he _ganz_ broke the piano , and it wa very bad manner indeed and I said so . And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it . And then I called the porter , and Karl came , and he took Karl and hit him in the eye ; and he hit Henriette in the eye , too , and gave me five slap on the cheek . And it wa so ungentlemanly in an honourable house , Mr. Captain , and I screamed . And he opened the window over the canal , and stood in the window , squealing like a little pig ; it wa a disgrace . The idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the street ! Fie upon him ! And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat , and it is true , Mr. Captain , he tore _sein rock_ . And then he shouted that _man muss_ pay him fifteen rouble damage . And I did pay him , Mr. Captain , five rouble for _sein rock_ . And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal . ‘ I will show you up , ’ he said , ‘ for I can write to all the paper about you. ’ ” “ Then he wa an author ? ” “ Yes , Mr. Captain , and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house .... ” “ Now then ! Enough ! I have told you already ... ” “ Ilya Petrovitch ! ” the head clerk repeated significantly . The assistant glanced rapidly at him ; the head clerk slightly shook his head . “ ... So I tell you this , most respectable Luise Ivanovna , and I tell it you for the last time , ” the assistant went on . “ If there is a scandal in your honourable house once again , I will put you yourself in the lock-up , a it is called in polite society . Do you hear ? So a literary man , an author took five rouble for his coat-tail in an ‘ honourable house ’ ? A nice set , these author ! ” And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov . “ There wa a scandal the other day in a restaurant , too . An author had eaten his dinner and would not pay ; ‘ I ’ ll write a satire on you , ’ say he . And there wa another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil councillor , his wife and daughter . And there wa one of them turned out of a confectioner ’ s shop the other day . They are like that , author , literary men , student , town-criers .... Pfoo ! You get along ! I shall look in upon you myself one day . Then you had better be careful ! Do you hear ? ” With hurried deference , Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all direction , and so curtsied herself to the door . But at the door , she stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh , open face and splendid thick fair whisker . This wa the superintendent of the district himself , Nikodim Fomitch . Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground , and with mincing little step , she fluttered out of the office . “ Again thunder and lightning -- a hurricane ! ” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone . “ You are aroused again , you are fuming again ! I heard it on the stair ! ” “ Well , what then ! ” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance ; and he walked with some paper to another table , with a jaunty swing of his shoulder at each step . “ Here , if you will kindly look : an author , or a student , ha been one at least , doe not pay his debt , ha given an I O U , won ’ t clear out of his room , and complaint are constantly being lodged against him , and here he ha been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his presence ! He behaves like a cad himself , and just look at him , please . Here ’ s the gentleman , and very attractive he is ! ” “ Poverty is not a vice , my friend , but we know you go off like powder , you can ’ t bear a slight , I daresay you took offence at something and went too far yourself , ” continued Nikodim Fomitch , turning affably to Raskolnikov . “ But you were wrong there ; he is a capital fellow , I assure you , but explosive , explosive ! He get hot , fire up , boil over , and no stopping him ! And then it ’ s all over ! And at the bottom he ’ s a heart of gold ! His nickname in the regiment wa the Explosive Lieutenant .... ” “ And what a regiment it wa , too , ” cried Ilya Petrovitch , much gratified at this agreeable banter , though still sulky . Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant to them all . “ Excuse me , Captain , ” he began easily , suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomitch , “ will you enter into my position ? ... I am ready to ask pardon , if I have been ill-mannered . I am a poor student , sick and shattered ( shattered wa the word he used ) by poverty . I am not studying , because I can not keep myself now , but I shall get money .... I have a mother and sister in the province of X . They will send it to me , and I will pay . My landlady is a good-hearted woman , but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lesson , and not paying her for the last four month , that she doe not even send up my dinner ... and I don ’ t understand this I O U at all . She is asking me to pay her on this I O U . How am I to pay her ? Judge for yourselves ! ... ” “ But that is not our business , you know , ” the head clerk wa observing . “ Yes , yes . I perfectly agree with you . But allow me to explain ... ” Raskolnikov put in again , still addressing Nikodim Fomitch , but trying his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also , though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his paper and to be contemptuously oblivious of him . “ Allow me to explain that I have been living with her for nearly three year and at first ... at first ... for why should I not confess it , at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter , it wa a verbal promise , freely given ... she wa a girl ... indeed , I liked her , though I wa not in love with her ... a youthful affair in fact ... that is , I mean to say , that my landlady gave me credit freely in those day , and I led a life of ... I wa very heedless ... ” “ Nobody asks you for these personal detail , sir , we ’ ve no time to waste , ” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph ; but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly , though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak . “ But excuse me , excuse me . It is for me to explain ... how it all happened ... In my turn ... though I agree with you ... it is unnecessary . But a year ago , the girl died of typhus . I remained lodging there a before , and when my landlady moved into her present quarter , she said to me ... and in a friendly way ... that she had complete trust in me , but still , would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen rouble , all the debt I owed her . She said if only I gave her that , she would trust me again , a much a I liked , and that she would never , never -- those were her own word -- make use of that I O U till I could pay of myself ... and now , when I have lost my lesson and have nothing to eat , she take action against me . What am I to say to that ? ” “ All these affecting detail are no business of ours. ” Ilya Petrovitch interrupted rudely . “ You must give a written undertaking but a for your love affair and all these tragic event , we have nothing to do with that. ” “ Come now ... you are harsh , ” muttered Nikodim Fomitch , sitting down at the table and also beginning to write . He looked a little ashamed . “ Write ! ” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov . “ Write what ? ” the latter asked , gruffly . “ I will dictate to you. ” Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech , but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone ’ s opinion , and this revulsion took place in a flash , in one instant . If he had cared to think a little , he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before , forcing his feeling upon them . And where had those feeling come from ? Now if the whole room had been filled , not with police officer , but with those nearest and dearest to him , he would not have found one human word for them , so empty wa his heart . A gloomy sensation of agonising , everlasting solitude and remoteness , took conscious form in his soul . It wa not the meanness of his sentimental effusion before Ilya Petrovitch , nor the meanness of the latter ’ s triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart . Oh , what had he to do now with his own baseness , with all these petty vanity , officer , German woman , debt , police-offices ? If he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment , he would not have stirred , would hardly have heard the sentence to the end . Something wa happening to him entirely new , sudden and unknown . It wa not that he understood , but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental effusion like his recent outburst , or with anything whatever ; and that if they had been his own brother and sister and not police-officers , it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life . He had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation . And what wa most agonising -- it wa more a sensation than a conception or idea , a direct sensation , the most agonising of all the sensation he had known in his life . The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration , that he could not pay , that he undertook to do so at a future date , that he would not leave the town , nor sell his property , and so on . “ But you can ’ t write , you can hardly hold the pen , ” observed the head clerk , looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov . “ Are you ill ? ” “ Yes , I am giddy . Go on ! ” “ That ’ s all . Sign it. ” The head clerk took the paper , and turned to attend to others . Raskolnikov gave back the pen ; but instead of getting up and going away , he put his elbow on the table and pressed his head in his hand . He felt a if a nail were being driven into his skull . A strange idea suddenly occurred to him , to get up at once , to go up to Nikodim Fomitch , and tell him everything that had happened yesterday , and then to go with him to his lodging and to show him the thing in the hole in the corner . The impulse wa so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out . “ Hadn ’ t I better think a minute ? ” flashed through his mind . “ No , better cast off the burden without thinking. ” But all at once he stood still , rooted to the spot . Nikodim Fomitch wa talking eagerly with Ilya Petrovitch , and the word reached him : “ It ’ s impossible , they ’ ll both be released . To begin with , the whole story contradicts itself . Why should they have called the porter , if it had been their doing ? To inform against themselves ? Or a a blind ? No , that would be too cunning ! Besides , Pestryakov , the student , wa seen at the gate by both the porter and a woman a he went in . He wa walking with three friend , who left him only at the gate , and he asked the porter to direct him , in the presence of the friend . Now , would he have asked his way if he had been going with such an object ? As for Koch , he spent half an hour at the silversmith ’ s below , before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight . Now just consider ... ” “ But excuse me , how do you explain this contradiction ? They state themselves that they knocked and the door wa locked ; yet three minute later when they went up with the porter , it turned out the door wa unfastened. ” “ That ’ s just it ; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in ; and they ’ d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been an as and gone to look for the porter too . _He_ must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow . Koch keep crossing himself and saying : ‘ If I had been there , he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe. ’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service -- ha , ha ! ” “ And no one saw the murderer ? ” “ They might well not see him ; the house is a regular Noah ’ s Ark , ” said the head clerk , who wa listening . “ It ’ s clear , quite clear , ” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly . “ No , it is anything but clear , ” Ilya Petrovitch maintained . Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door , but he did not reach it .... When he recovered consciousness , he found himself sitting in a chair , supported by someone on the right side , while someone else wa standing on the left , holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water , and Nikodim Fomitch standing before him , looking intently at him . He got up from the chair . “ What ’ s this ? Are you ill ? ” Nikodim Fomitch asked , rather sharply . “ He could hardly hold his pen when he wa signing , ” said the head clerk , settling back in his place , and taking up his work again . “ Have you been ill long ? ” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place , where he , too , wa looking through paper . He had , of course , come to look at the sick man when he fainted , but retired at once when he recovered . “ Since yesterday , ” muttered Raskolnikov in reply . “ Did you go out yesterday ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Though you were ill ? ” “ Yes. ” “ At what time ? ” “ About seven. ” “ And where did you go , may I ask ? ” “ Along the street. ” “ Short and clear. ” Raskolnikov , white a a handkerchief , had answered sharply , jerkily , without dropping his black feverish eye before Ilya Petrovitch ’ s stare . “ He can scarcely stand upright . And you ... ” Nikodim Fomitch wa beginning . “ No matter , ” Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly . Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest , but glancing at the head clerk who wa looking very hard at him , he did not speak . There wa a sudden silence . It wa strange . “ Very well , then , ” concluded Ilya Petrovitch , “ we will not detain you. ” Raskolnikov went out . He caught the sound of eager conversation on his departure , and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim Fomitch . In the street , his faintness passed off completely . “ A search -- there will be a search at once , ” he repeated to himself , hurrying home . “ The brute ! they suspect. ” His former terror mastered him completely again . CHAPTER II “ And what if there ha been a search already ? What if I find them in my room ? ” But here wa his room . Nothing and no one in it . No one had peeped in . Even Nastasya had not touched it . But heaven ! how could he have left all those thing in the hole ? He rushed to the corner , slipped his hand under the paper , pulled the thing out and lined his pocket with them . There were eight article in all : two little box with ear-rings or something of the sort , he hardly looked to see ; then four small leather case . There wa a chain , too , merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper , that looked like a decoration .... He put them all in the different pocket of his overcoat , and the remaining pocket of his trouser , trying to conceal them a much a possible . He took the purse , too . Then he went out of his room , leaving the door open . He walked quickly and resolutely , and though he felt shattered , he had his sens about him . He wa afraid of pursuit , he wa afraid that in another half-hour , another quarter of an hour perhaps , instruction would be issued for his pursuit , and so at all cost , he must hide all trace before then . He must clear everything up while he still had some strength , some reasoning power left him .... Where wa he to go ? That had long been settled : “ Fling them into the canal , and all trace hidden in the water , the thing would be at an end. ” So he had decided in the night of his delirium when several time he had had the impulse to get up and go away , to make haste , and get rid of it all . But to get rid of it , turned out to be a very difficult task . He wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several time at the step running down to the water , but he could not think of carrying out his plan ; either raft stood at the step ’ edge , and woman were washing clothes on them , or boat were moored there , and people were swarming everywhere . Moreover he could be seen and noticed from the bank on all side ; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose , stop , and throw something into the water . And what if the box were to float instead of sinking ? And of course they would . Even a it wa , everyone he met seemed to stare and look round , a if they had nothing to do but to watch him . “ Why is it , or can it be my fancy ? ” he thought . At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the Neva . There were not so many people there , he would be le observed , and it would be more convenient in every way , above all it wa further off . He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour , worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before . And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan , simply because he had thought of it in delirium ! He had become extremely absent and forgetful and he wa aware of it . He certainly must make haste . He walked towards the Neva along V -- -- Prospect , but on the way another idea struck him . “ Why to the Neva ? Would it not be better to go somewhere far off , to the Islands again , and there hide the thing in some solitary place , in a wood or under a bush , and mark the spot perhaps ? ” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment , the idea seemed to him a sound one . But he wa not destined to go there . For coming out of V -- -- Prospect towards the square , he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank wall to a courtyard . On the right hand , the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court ; on the left , a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty pace into the court , and then turned sharply to the left . Here wa a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sort wa lying . At the end of the court , the corner of a low , smutty , stone shed , apparently part of some workshop , peeped from behind the hoarding . It wa probably a carriage builder ’ s or carpenter ’ s shed ; the whole place from the entrance wa black with coal dust . Here would be the place to throw it , he thought . Not seeing anyone in the yard , he slipped in , and at once saw near the gate a sink , such a is often put in yard where there are many workman or cab-drivers ; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism , “ Standing here strictly forbidden. ” This wa all the better , for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in . “ Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away ! ” Looking round once more , with his hand already in his pocket , he noticed against the outer wall , between the entrance and the sink , a big unhewn stone , weighing perhaps sixty pound . The other side of the wall wa a street . He could hear passer-by , always numerous in that part , but he could not be seen from the entrance , unless someone came in from the street , which might well happen indeed , so there wa need of haste . He bent down over the stone , seized the top of it firmly in both hand , and using all his strength turned it over . Under the stone wa a small hollow in the ground , and he immediately emptied his pocket into it . The purse lay at the top , and yet the hollow wa not filled up . Then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back , so that it wa in the same position again , though it stood a very little higher . But he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edge with his foot . Nothing could be noticed . Then he went out , and turned into the square . Again an intense , almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant , a it had in the police-office . “ I have buried my track ! And who , who can think of looking under that stone ? It ha been lying there most likely ever since the house wa built , and will lie a many year more . And if it were found , who would think of me ? It is all over ! No clue ! ” And he laughed . Yes , he remembered that he began laughing a thin , nervous noiseless laugh , and went on laughing all the time he wa crossing the square . But when he reached the K -- -- Boulevard where two day before he had come upon that girl , his laughter suddenly ceased . Other idea crept into his mind . He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pas that seat on which after the girl wa gone , he had sat and pondered , and that it would be hateful , too , to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copeck : “ Damn him ! ” He walked , looking about him angrily and distractedly . All his idea now seemed to be circling round some single point , and he felt that there really wa such a point , and that now , now , he wa left facing that point -- and for the first time , indeed , during the last two month . “ Damn it all ! ” he thought suddenly , in a fit of ungovernable fury . “ If it ha begun , then it ha begun . Hang the new life ! Good Lord , how stupid it is ! ... And what lie I told to-day ! How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch ! But that is all folly ! What do I care for them all , and my fawning upon them ! It is not that at all ! It is not that at all ! ” Suddenly he stopped ; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him . “ If it all ha really been done deliberately and not idiotically , if I really had a certain and definite object , how is it I did not even glance into the purse and don ’ t know what I had there , for which I have undergone these agony , and have deliberately undertaken this base , filthy degrading business ? And here I wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the thing which I had not seen either ... how ’ s that ? ” Yes , that wa so , that wa all so . Yet he had known it all before , and it wa not a new question for him , even when it wa decided in the night without hesitation and consideration , a though so it must be , a though it could not possibly be otherwise .... Yes , he had known it all , and understood it all ; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he wa bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it .... Yes , so it wa . “ It is because I am very ill , ” he decided grimly at last , “ I have been worrying and fretting myself , and I don ’ t know what I am doing .... Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself .... I shall get well and I shall not worry .... But what if I don ’ t get well at all ? Good God , how sick I am of it all ! ” He walked on without resting . He had a terrible longing for some distraction , but he did not know what to do , what to attempt . A new overwhelming sensation wa gaining more and more mastery over him every moment ; this wa an immeasurable , almost physical , repulsion for everything surrounding him , an obstinate , malignant feeling of hatred . All who met him were loathsome to him -- he loathed their face , their movement , their gesture . If anyone had addressed him , he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him .... He stopped suddenly , on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva , near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov . “ Why , he life here , in that house , ” he thought , “ why , I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord ! Here it ’ s the same thing over again .... Very interesting to know , though ; have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance ? Never mind , I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the day _after_ ; well , and so I will ! Besides I really can not go further now. ” He went up to Razumihin ’ s room on the fifth floor . The latter wa at home in his garret , busily writing at the moment , and he opened the door himself . It wa four month since they had seen each other . Razumihin wa sitting in a ragged dressing-gown , with slipper on his bare foot , unkempt , unshaven and unwashed . His face showed surprise . “ Is it you ? ” he cried . He looked his comrade up and down ; then after a brief pause , he whistled . “ As hard up a all that ! Why , brother , you ’ ve cut me out ! ” he added , looking at Raskolnikov ’ s rag . “ Come sit down , you are tired , I ’ ll be bound. ” And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa , which wa in even worse condition than his own , Razumihin saw at once that his visitor wa ill. “ Why , you are seriously ill , do you know that ? ” He began feeling his pulse . Raskolnikov pulled away his hand . “ Never mind , ” he said , “ I have come for this : I have no lesson .... I wanted , ... but I don ’ t really want lesson .... ” “ But I say ! You are delirious , you know ! ” Razumihin observed , watching him carefully . “ No , I am not. ” Raskolnikov got up from the sofa . As he had mounted the stair to Razumihin ’ s , he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face . Now , in a flash , he knew , that what he wa least of all disposed for at that moment wa to be face to face with anyone in the wide world . His spleen rose within him . He almost choked with rage at himself a soon a he crossed Razumihin ’ s threshold . “ Good-bye , ” he said abruptly , and walked to the door . “ Stop , stop ! You queer fish. ” “ I don ’ t want to , ” said the other , again pulling away his hand . “ Then why the devil have you come ? Are you mad , or what ? Why , this is ... almost insulting ! I won ’ t let you go like that. ” “ Well , then , I came to you because I know no one but you who could help ... to begin ... because you are kinder than anyone -- cleverer , I mean , and can judge ... and now I see that I want nothing . Do you hear ? Nothing at all ... no one ’ s service ... no one ’ s sympathy . I am by myself ... alone . Come , that ’ s enough . Leave me alone. ” “ Stay a minute , you sweep ! You are a perfect madman . As you like for all I care . I have no lesson , do you see , and I don ’ t care about that , but there ’ s a bookseller , Heruvimov -- and he take the place of a lesson . I would not exchange him for five lesson . He ’ s doing publishing of a kind , and issuing natural science manual and what a circulation they have ! The very title are worth the money ! You always maintained that I wa a fool , but by Jove , my boy , there are greater fool than I am ! Now he is setting up for being advanced , not that he ha an inkling of anything , but , of course , I encourage him . Here are two signature of the German text -- in my opinion , the crudest charlatanism ; it discus the question , ‘ Is woman a human being ? ’ And , of course , triumphantly prof that she is . Heruvimov is going to bring out this work a a contribution to the woman question ; I am translating it ; he will expand these two and a half signature into six , we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble . It will do ! He pay me six rouble the signature , it work out to about fifteen rouble for the job , and I ’ ve had six already in advance . When we have finished this , we are going to begin a translation about whale , and then some of the dullest scandal out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have marked for translation ; somebody ha told Heruvimov , that Rousseau wa a kind of Radishchev . You may be sure I don ’ t contradict him , hang him ! Well , would you like to do the second signature of ‘ _Is woman a human being ? _ ’ If you would , take the German and pen and paper -- all those are provided , and take three rouble ; for a I have had six rouble in advance on the whole thing , three rouble come to you for your share . And when you have finished the signature there will be another three rouble for you . And please don ’ t think I am doing you a service ; quite the contrary , a soon a you came in , I saw how you could help me ; to begin with , I am weak in spelling , and secondly , I am sometimes utterly adrift in German , so that I make it up a I go along for the most part . The only comfort is , that it ’ s bound to be a change for the better . Though who can tell , maybe it ’ s sometimes for the worse . Will you take it ? ” Raskolnikov took the German sheet in silence , took the three rouble and without a word went out . Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment . But when Raskolnikov wa in the next street , he turned back , mounted the stair to Razumihin ’ s again and laying on the table the German article and the three rouble , went out again , still without uttering a word . “ Are you raving , or what ? ” Razumihin shouted , roused to fury at last . “ What farce is this ? You ’ ll drive me crazy too ... what did you come to see me for , damn you ? ” “ I don ’ t want ... translation , ” muttered Raskolnikov from the stair . “ Then what the devil do you want ? ” shouted Razumihin from above . Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence . “ Hey , there ! Where are you living ? ” No answer . “ Well , confound you then ! ” But Raskolnikov wa already stepping into the street . On the Nikolaevsky Bridge he wa roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident . A coachman , after shouting at him two or three time , gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip , for having almost fallen under his horse ’ hoof . The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing ( for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic ) . He angrily clenched and ground his teeth . He heard laughter , of course . “ Serves him right ! ” “ A pickpocket I dare say. ” “ Pretending to be drunk , for sure , and getting under the wheel on purpose ; and you have to answer for him. ” “ It ’ s a regular profession , that ’ s what it is. ” But while he stood at the railing , still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage , and rubbing his back , he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand . He looked . It wa an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoe , with a girl , probably her daughter , wearing a hat , and carrying a green parasol . “ Take it , my good man , in Christ ’ s name. ” He took it and they passed on . It wa a piece of twenty copeck . From his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the street , and the gift of the twenty copeck he doubtless owed to the blow , which made them feel sorry for him . He closed his hand on the twenty copeck , walked on for ten pace , and turned facing the Neva , looking towards the palace . The sky wa without a cloud and the water wa almost bright blue , which is so rare in the Neva . The cupola of the cathedral , which is seen at it best from the bridge about twenty pace from the chapel , glittered in the sunlight , and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished . The pain from the lash went off , and Raskolnikov forgot about it ; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely . He stood still , and gazed long and intently into the distance ; this spot wa especially familiar to him . When he wa attending the university , he had hundred of time -- generally on his way home -- stood still on this spot , gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him . It left him strangely cold ; this gorgeous picture wa for him blank and lifeless . He wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and , mistrusting himself , put off finding the explanation of it . He vividly recalled those old doubt and perplexity , and it seemed to him that it wa no mere chance that he recalled them now . It struck him a strange and grotesque , that he should have stopped at the same spot a before , a though he actually imagined he could think the same thought , be interested in the same theory and picture that had interested him ... so short a time ago . He felt it almost amusing , and yet it wrung his heart . Deep down , hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now -- all his old past , his old thought , his old problem and theory , his old impression and that picture and himself and all , all .... He felt a though he were flying upwards , and everything were vanishing from his sight . Making an unconscious movement with his hand , he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist . He opened his hand , stared at the coin , and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water ; then he turned and went home . It seemed to him , he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment . Evening wa coming on when he reached home , so that he must have been walking about six hour . How and where he came back he did not remember . Undressing , and quivering like an overdriven horse , he lay down on the sofa , drew his greatcoat over him , and at once sank into oblivion .... It wa dusk when he wa waked up by a fearful scream . Good God , what a scream ! Such unnatural sound , such howling , wailing , grinding , tear , blow and curse he had never heard . He could never have imagined such brutality , such frenzy . In terror he sat up in bed , almost swooning with agony . But the fighting , wailing and cursing grew louder and louder . And then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady . She wa howling , shrieking and wailing , rapidly , hurriedly , incoherently , so that he could not make out what she wa talking about ; she wa beseeching , no doubt , not to be beaten , for she wa being mercilessly beaten on the stair . The voice of her assailant wa so horrible from spite and rage that it wa almost a croak ; but he , too , wa saying something , and just a quickly and indistinctly , hurrying and spluttering . All at once Raskolnikov trembled ; he recognised the voice -- it wa the voice of Ilya Petrovitch . Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady ! He is kicking her , banging her head against the step -- that ’ s clear , that can be told from the sound , from the cry and the thud . How is it , is the world topsy-turvy ? He could hear people running in crowd from all the storey and all the staircase ; he heard voice , exclamation , knocking , door banging . “ But why , why , and how could it be ? ” he repeated , thinking seriously that he had gone mad . But no , he heard too distinctly ! And they would come to him then next , “ for no doubt ... it ’ s all about that ... about yesterday .... Good God ! ” He would have fastened his door with the latch , but he could not lift his hand ... besides , it would be useless . Terror gripped his heart like ice , tortured him and numbed him .... But at last all this uproar , after continuing about ten minute , began gradually to subside . The landlady wa moaning and groaning ; Ilya Petrovitch wa still uttering threat and curse .... But at last he , too , seemed to be silent , and now he could not be heard . “ Can he have gone away ? Good Lord ! ” Yes , and now the landlady is going too , still weeping and moaning ... and then her door slammed .... Now the crowd wa going from the stair to their room , exclaiming , disputing , calling to one another , raising their voice to a shout , dropping them to a whisper . There must have been number of them -- almost all the inmate of the block . “ But , good God , how could it be ! And why , why had he come here ! ” Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa , but could not close his eye . He lay for half an hour in such anguish , such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror a he had never experienced before . Suddenly a bright light flashed into his room . Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup . Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he wa not asleep , she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought -- bread , salt , a plate , a spoon . “ You ’ ve eaten nothing since yesterday , I warrant . You ’ ve been trudging about all day , and you ’ re shaking with fever. ” “ Nastasya ... what were they beating the landlady for ? ” She looked intently at him . “ Who beat the landlady ? ” “ Just now ... half an hour ago , Ilya Petrovitch , the assistant superintendent , on the stair .... Why wa he ill-treating her like that , and ... why wa he here ? ” Nastasya scrutinised him , silent and frowning , and her scrutiny lasted a long time . He felt uneasy , even frightened at her searching eye . “ Nastasya , why don ’ t you speak ? ” he said timidly at last in a weak voice . “ It ’ s the blood , ” she answered at last softly , a though speaking to herself . “ Blood ? What blood ? ” he muttered , growing white and turning towards the wall . Nastasya still looked at him without speaking . “ Nobody ha been beating the landlady , ” she declared at last in a firm , resolute voice . He gazed at her , hardly able to breathe . “ I heard it myself .... I wa not asleep ... I wa sitting up , ” he said still more timidly . “ I listened a long while . The assistant superintendent came .... Everyone ran out on to the stair from all the flats. ” “ No one ha been here . That ’ s the blood cry in your ear . When there ’ s no outlet for it and it get clotted , you begin fancying thing .... Will you eat something ? ” He made no answer . Nastasya still stood over him , watching him . “ Give me something to drink ... Nastasya. ” She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water . He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck . Then followed forgetfulness . CHAPTER III He wa not completely unconscious , however , all the time he wa ill ; he wa in a feverish state , sometimes delirious , sometimes half conscious . He remembered a great deal afterwards . Sometimes it seemed a though there were a number of people round him ; they wanted to take him away somewhere , there wa a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him . Then he would be alone in the room ; they had all gone away afraid of him , and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him ; they threatened him , plotted something together , laughed , and mocked at him . He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside ; he distinguished another person , too , whom he seemed to know very well , though he could not remember who he wa , and this fretted him , even made him cry . Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month ; at other time it all seemed part of the same day . But of _that_ -- of _that_ he had no recollection , and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember . He worried and tormented himself trying to remember , moaned , flew into a rage , or sank into awful , intolerable terror . Then he struggled to get up , would have run away , but someone always prevented him by force , and he sank back into impotence and forgetfulness . At last he returned to complete consciousness . It happened at ten o ’ clock in the morning . On fine day the sun shone into the room at that hour , throwing a streak of light on the right wall and the corner near the door . Nastasya wa standing beside him with another person , a complete stranger , who wa looking at him very inquisitively . He wa a young man with a beard , wearing a full , short-waisted coat , and looked like a messenger . The landlady wa peeping in at the half-opened door . Raskolnikov sat up . “ Who is this , Nastasya ? ” he asked , pointing to the young man . “ I say , he ’ s himself again ! ” she said . “ He is himself , ” echoed the man . Concluding that he had returned to his sens , the landlady closed the door and disappeared . She wa always shy and dreaded conversation or discussion . She wa a woman of forty , not at all bad-looking , fat and buxom , with black eye and eyebrow , good-natured from fatness and laziness , and absurdly bashful . “ Who ... are you ? ” he went on , addressing the man . But at that moment the door wa flung open , and , stooping a little , a he wa so tall , Razumihin came in . “ What a cabin it is ! ” he cried . “ I am always knocking my head . You call this a lodging ! So you are conscious , brother ? I ’ ve just heard the news from Pashenka. ” “ He ha just come to , ” said Nastasya . “ Just come to , ” echoed the man again , with a smile . “ And who are you ? ” Razumihin asked , suddenly addressing him . “ My name is Vrazumihin , at your service ; not Razumihin , a I am always called , but Vrazumihin , a student and gentleman ; and he is my friend . And who are you ? ” “ I am the messenger from our office , from the merchant Shelopaev , and I ’ ve come on business. ” “ Please sit down. ” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table . “ It ’ s a good thing you ’ ve come to , brother , ” he went on to Raskolnikov . “ For the last four day you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything . We had to give you tea in spoonful . I brought Zossimov to see you twice . You remember Zossimov ? He examined you carefully and said at once it wa nothing serious -- something seemed to have gone to your head . Some nervous nonsense , the result of bad feeding , he say you have not had enough beer and radish , but it ’ s nothing much , it will pas and you will be all right . Zossimov is a first-rate fellow ! He is making quite a name . Come , I won ’ t keep you , ” he said , addressing the man again . “ Will you explain what you want ? You must know , Rodya , this is the second time they have sent from the office ; but it wa another man last time , and I talked to him . Who wa it came before ? ” “ That wa the day before yesterday , I venture to say , if you please , sir . That wa Alexey Semyonovitch ; he is in our office , too. ” “ He wa more intelligent than you , don ’ t you think so ? ” “ Yes , indeed , sir , he is of more weight than I am. ” “ Quite so ; go on. ” “ At your mamma ’ s request , through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin , of whom I presume you have heard more than once , a remittance is sent to you from our office , ” the man began , addressing Raskolnikov . “ If you are in an intelligible condition , I ’ ve thirty-five rouble to remit to you , a Semyon Semyonovitch ha received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma ’ s request instruction to that effect , a on previous occasion . Do you know him , sir ? ” “ Yes , I remember ... Vahrushin , ” Raskolnikov said dreamily . “ You hear , he know Vahrushin , ” cried Razumihin . “ He is in ‘ an intelligible condition ’ ! And I see you are an intelligent man too . Well , it ’ s always pleasant to hear word of wisdom. ” “ That ’ s the gentleman , Vahrushin , Afanasy Ivanovitch . And at the request of your mamma , who ha sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him , he did not refuse this time also , and sent instruction to Semyon Semyonovitch some day since to hand you thirty-five rouble in the hope of better to come. ” “ That ‘ hoping for better to come ’ is the best thing you ’ ve said , though ‘ your mamma ’ is not bad either . Come then , what do you say ? Is he fully conscious , eh ? ” “ That ’ s all right . If only he can sign this little paper. ” “ He can scrawl his name . Have you got the book ? ” “ Yes , here ’ s the book. ” “ Give it to me . Here , Rodya , sit up . I ’ ll hold you . Take the pen and scribble ‘ Raskolnikov ’ for him . For just now , brother , money is sweeter to u than treacle. ” “ I don ’ t want it , ” said Raskolnikov , pushing away the pen . “ Not want it ? ” “ I won ’ t sign it. ” “ How the devil can you do without signing it ? ” “ I don ’ t want ... the money. ” “ Don ’ t want the money ! Come , brother , that ’ s nonsense , I bear witness . Don ’ t trouble , please , it ’ s only that he is on his travel again . But that ’ s pretty common with him at all time though .... You are a man of judgment and we will take him in hand , that is , more simply , take his hand and he will sign it . Here. ” “ But I can come another time. ” “ No , no . Why should we trouble you ? You are a man of judgment .... Now , Rodya , don ’ t keep your visitor , you see he is waiting , ” and he made ready to hold Raskolnikov ’ s hand in earnest . “ Stop , I ’ ll do it alone , ” said the latter , taking the pen and signing his name . The messenger took out the money and went away . “ Bravo ! And now , brother , are you hungry ? ” “ Yes , ” answered Raskolnikov . “ Is there any soup ? ” “ Some of yesterday ’ s , ” answered Nastasya , who wa still standing there . “ With potato and rice in it ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I know it by heart . Bring soup and give u some tea. ” “ Very well. ” Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull , unreasoning terror . He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen . “ I believe I am not wandering . I believe it ’ s reality , ” he thought . In a couple of minute Nastasya returned with the soup , and announced that the tea would be ready directly . With the soup she brought two spoon , two plate , salt , pepper , mustard for the beef , and so on . The table wa set a it had not been for a long time . The cloth wa clean . “ It would not be amiss , Nastasya , if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send u up a couple of bottle of beer . We could empty them. ” “ Well , you are a cool hand , ” muttered Nastasya , and she departed to carry out his order . Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention . Meanwhile Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him , a clumsily a a bear put his left arm round Raskolnikov ’ s head , although he wa able to sit up , and with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup , blowing on it that it might not burn him . But the soup wa only just warm . Raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily , then a second , then a third . But after giving him a few more spoonful of soup , Razumihin suddenly stopped , and said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more . Nastasya came in with two bottle of beer . “ And will you have tea ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Cut along , Nastasya , and bring some tea , for tea we may venture on without the faculty . But here is the beer ! ” He moved back to his chair , pulled the soup and meat in front of him , and began eating a though he had not touched food for three day . “ I must tell you , Rodya , I dine like this here every day now , ” he mumbled with his mouth full of beef , “ and it ’ s all Pashenka , your dear little landlady , who see to that ; she love to do anything for me . I don ’ t ask for it , but , of course , I don ’ t object . And here ’ s Nastasya with the tea . She is a quick girl . Nastasya , my dear , won ’ t you have some beer ? ” “ Get along with your nonsense ! ” “ A cup of tea , then ? ” “ A cup of tea , maybe. ” “ Pour it out . Stay , I ’ ll pour it out myself . Sit down. ” He poured out two cup , left his dinner , and sat on the sofa again . As before , he put his left arm round the sick man ’ s head , raised him up and gave him tea in spoonful , again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly , a though this process wa the principal and most effective mean towards his friend ’ s recovery . Raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance , though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon , but even perhaps could have walked about . But from some queer , almost animal , cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time , pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his faculty , and meanwhile listening to find out what wa going on . Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance . After sipping a dozen spoonful of tea , he suddenly released his head , pushed the spoon away capriciously , and sank back on the pillow . There were actually real pillow under his head now , down pillow in clean case , he observed that , too , and took note of it . “ Pashenka must give u some raspberry jam to-day to make him some raspberry tea , ” said Razumihin , going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again . “ And where is she to get raspberry for you ? ” asked Nastasya , balancing a saucer on her five outspread finger and sipping tea through a lump of sugar . “ She ’ ll get it at the shop , my dear . You see , Rodya , all sort of thing have been happening while you have been laid up . When you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address , I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out and punish you . I set to work that very day . How I ran about making inquiry for you ! This lodging of yours I had forgotten , though I never remembered it , indeed , because I did not know it ; and a for your old lodging , I could only remember it wa at the Five Corners , Harlamov ’ s house . I kept trying to find that Harlamov ’ s house , and afterwards it turned out that it wa not Harlamov ’ s , but Buch ’ s . How one muddle up sound sometimes ! So I lost my temper , and I went on the chance to the address bureau next day , and only fancy , in two minute they looked you up ! Your name is down there. ” “ My name ! ” “ I should think so ; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while I wa there . Well , it ’ s a long story . But a soon a I did land on this place , I soon got to know all your affair -- all , all , brother , I know everything ; Nastasya here will tell you . I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch , and the house-porter and Mr. Zametov , Alexandr Grigorievitch , the head clerk in the police office , and , last , but not least , of Pashenka ; Nastasya here know .... ” “ He ’ s got round her , ” Nastasya murmured , smiling slyly . “ Why don ’ t you put the sugar in your tea , Nastasya Nikiforovna ? ” “ You are a one ! ” Nastasya cried suddenly , going off into a giggle . “ I am not Nikiforovna , but Petrovna , ” she added suddenly , recovering from her mirth . “ I ’ ll make a note of it . Well , brother , to make a long story short , I wa going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influence in the locality , but Pashenka won the day . I had not expected , brother , to find her so ... prepossessing . Eh , what do you think ? ” Raskolnikov did not speak , but he still kept his eye fixed upon him , full of alarm . “ And all that could be wished , indeed , in every respect , ” Razumihin went on , not at all embarrassed by his silence . “ Ah , the sly dog ! ” Nastasya shrieked again . This conversation afforded her unspeakable delight . “ It ’ s a pity , brother , that you did not set to work in the right way at first . You ought to have approached her differently . She is , so to speak , a most unaccountable character . But we will talk about her character later .... How could you let thing come to such a pas that she gave up sending you your dinner ? And that I O U ? You must have been mad to sign an I O U . And that promise of marriage when her daughter , Natalya Yegorovna , wa alive ? ... I know all about it ! But I see that ’ s a delicate matter and I am an as ; forgive me . But , talking of foolishness , do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish a you would think at first sight ? ” “ No , ” mumbled Raskolnikov , looking away , but feeling that it wa better to keep up the conversation . “ She isn ’ t , is she ? ” cried Razumihin , delighted to get an answer out of him . “ But she is not very clever either , eh ? She is essentially , essentially an unaccountable character ! I am sometimes quite at a loss , I assure you .... She must be forty ; she say she is thirty-six , and of course she ha every right to say so . But I swear I judge her intellectually , simply from the metaphysical point of view ; there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between u , a sort of algebra or what not ! I don ’ t understand it ! Well , that ’ s all nonsense . Only , seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lesson and your clothes , and that through the young lady ’ s death she ha no need to treat you a a relation , she suddenly took fright ; and a you hid in your den and dropped all your old relation with her , she planned to get rid of you . And she ’ s been cherishing that design a long time , but wa sorry to lose the I O U , for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay. ” “ It wa base of me to say that .... My mother herself is almost a beggar ... and I told a lie to keep my lodging ... and be fed , ” Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly . “ Yes , you did very sensibly . But the worst of it is that at that point Mr. Tchebarov turn up , a business man . Pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her own account , she is too retiring ; but the business man is by no mean retiring , and first thing he put the question , ‘ Is there any hope of realising the I O U ? ’ Answer : there is , because he ha a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and twenty-five rouble pension , if she ha to starve herself ; and a sister , too , who would go into bondage for his sake . That ’ s what he wa building upon .... Why do you start ? I know all the in and out of your affair now , my dear boy -- it ’ s not for nothing that you were so open with Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law , and I say all this a a friend .... But I tell you what it is ; an honest and sensitive man is open ; and a business man ‘ listens and go on eating ’ you up . Well , then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov , and without hesitation he made a formal demand for payment . When I heard of all this I wanted to blow him up , too , to clear my conscience , but by that time harmony reigned between me and Pashenka , and I insisted on stopping the whole affair , engaging that you would pay . I went security for you , brother . Do you understand ? We called Tchebarov , flung him ten rouble and got the I O U back from him , and here I have the honour of presenting it to you . She trust your word now . Here , take it , you see I have torn it. ” Razumihin put the note on the table . Raskolnikov looked at him and turned to the wall without uttering a word . Even Razumihin felt a twinge . “ I see , brother , ” he said a moment later , “ that I have been playing the fool again . I thought I should amuse you with my chatter , and I believe I have only made you cross. ” “ Was it you I did not recognise when I wa delirious ? ” Raskolnikov asked , after a moment ’ s pause without turning his head . “ Yes , and you flew into a rage about it , especially when I brought Zametov one day. ” “ Zametov ? The head clerk ? What for ? ” Raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his eye on Razumihin . “ What ’ s the matter with you ? ... What are you upset about ? He wanted to make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you .... How could I have found out so much except from him ? He is a capital fellow , brother , first-rate ... in his own way , of course . Now we are friend -- see each other almost every day . I have moved into this part , you know . I have only just moved . I ’ ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna once or twice .... Do you remember Luise , Luise Ivanovna ? “ Did I say anything in delirium ? ” “ I should think so ! You were beside yourself. ” “ What did I rave about ? ” “ What next ? What did you rave about ? What people do rave about .... Well , brother , now I must not lose time . To work. ” He got up from the table and took up his cap . “ What did I rave about ? ” “ How he keep on ! Are you afraid of having let out some secret ? Don ’ t worry yourself ; you said nothing about a countess . But you said a lot about a bulldog , and about ear-rings and chain , and about Krestovsky Island , and some porter , and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch , the assistant superintendent . And another thing that wa of special interest to you wa your own sock . You whined , ‘ Give me my sock. ’ Zametov hunted all about your room for your sock , and with his own scented , ring-bedecked finger he gave you the rag . And only then were you comforted , and for the next twenty-four hour you held the wretched thing in your hand ; we could not get it from you . It is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment . And then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trouser . We tried to find out what sort of fringe , but we could not make it out . Now to business ! Here are thirty-five rouble ; I take ten of them , and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two . I will let Zossimov know at the same time , though he ought to have been here long ago , for it is nearly twelve . And you , Nastasya , look in pretty often while I am away , to see whether he want a drink or anything else . And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted myself . Good-bye ! ” “ He call her Pashenka ! Ah , he ’ s a deep one ! ” said Nastasya a he went out ; then she opened the door and stood listening , but could not resist running downstairs after him . She wa very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady . She wa evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin . No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman . With burning , twitching impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to work . But to what work ? Now , a though to spite him , it eluded him . “ Good God , only tell me one thing : do they know of it yet or not ? What if they know it and are only pretending , mocking me while I am laid up , and then they will come in and tell me that it ’ s been discovered long ago and that they have only ... What am I to do now ? That ’ s what I ’ ve forgotten , a though on purpose ; forgotten it all at once , I remembered a minute ago. ” He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him ; he walked to the door , opened it , listened ; but that wa not what he wanted . Suddenly , a though recalling something , he rushed to the corner where there wa a hole under the paper , began examining it , put his hand into the hole , fumbled -- but that wa not it . He went to the stove , opened it and began rummaging in the ash ; the frayed edge of his trouser and the rag cut off his pocket were lying there just a he had thrown them . No one had looked , then ! Then he remembered the sock about which Razumihin had just been telling him . Yes , there it lay on the sofa under the quilt , but it wa so covered with dust and grime that Zametov could not have seen anything on it . “ Bah , Zametov ! The police office ! And why am I sent for to the police office ? Where ’ s the notice ? Bah ! I am mixing it up ; that wa then . I looked at my sock then , too , but now ... now I have been ill . But what did Zametov come for ? Why did Razumihin bring him ? ” he muttered , helplessly sitting on the sofa again . “ What doe it mean ? Am I still in delirium , or is it real ? I believe it is real .... Ah , I remember ; I must escape ! Make haste to escape . Yes , I must , I must escape ! Yes ... but where ? And where are my clothes ? I ’ ve no boot . They ’ ve taken them away ! They ’ ve hidden them ! I understand ! Ah , here is my coat -- they passed that over ! And here is money on the table , thank God ! And here ’ s the I O U ... I ’ ll take the money and go and take another lodging . They won ’ t find me ! ... Yes , but the address bureau ? They ’ ll find me , Razumihin will find me . Better escape altogether ... far away ... to America , and let them do their worst ! And take the I O U ... it would be of use there .... What else shall I take ? They think I am ill ! They don ’ t know that I can walk , ha-ha-ha ! I could see by their eye that they know all about it ! If only I could get downstairs ! And what if they have set a watch there -- policeman ! What ’ s this tea ? Ah , and here is beer left , half a bottle , cold ! ” He snatched up the bottle , which still contained a glassful of beer , and gulped it down with relish , a though quenching a flame in his breast . But in another minute the beer had gone to his head , and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine . He lay down and pulled the quilt over him . His sick and incoherent thought grew more and more disconnected , and soon a light , pleasant drowsiness came upon him . With a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow , wrapped more closely about him the soft , wadded quilt which had replaced the old , ragged greatcoat , sighed softly and sank into a deep , sound , refreshing sleep . He woke up , hearing someone come in . He opened his eye and saw Razumihin standing in the doorway , uncertain whether to come in or not . Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him , a though trying to recall something . “ Ah , you are not asleep ! Here I am ! Nastasya , bring in the parcel ! ” Razumihin shouted down the stair . “ You shall have the account directly. ” “ What time is it ? ” asked Raskolnikov , looking round uneasily . “ Yes , you had a fine sleep , brother , it ’ s almost evening , it will be six o ’ clock directly . You have slept more than six hours. ” “ Good heaven ! Have I ? ” “ And why not ? It will do you good . What ’ s the hurry ? A tryst , is it ? We ’ ve all time before u . I ’ ve been waiting for the last three hour for you ; I ’ ve been up twice and found you asleep . I ’ ve called on Zossimov twice ; not at home , only fancy ! But no matter , he will turn up . And I ’ ve been out on my own business , too . You know I ’ ve been moving to-day , moving with my uncle . I have an uncle living with me now . But that ’ s no matter , to business . Give me the parcel , Nastasya . We will open it directly . And how do you feel now , brother ? ” “ I am quite well , I am not ill. Razumihin , have you been here long ? ” “ I tell you I ’ ve been waiting for the last three hours. ” “ No , before. ” “ How do you mean ? ” “ How long have you been coming here ? ” “ Why I told you all about it this morning . Don ’ t you remember ? ” Raskolnikov pondered . The morning seemed like a dream to him . He could not remember alone , and looked inquiringly at Razumihin . “ Hm ! ” said the latter , “ he ha forgotten . I fancied then that you were not quite yourself . Now you are better for your sleep .... You really look much better . First-rate ! Well , to business . Look here , my dear boy. ” He began untying the bundle , which evidently interested him . “ Believe me , brother , this is something specially near my heart . For we must make a man of you . Let ’ s begin from the top . Do you see this cap ? ” he said , taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap . “ Let me try it on. ” “ Presently , afterwards , ” said Raskolnikov , waving it off pettishly . “ Come , Rodya , my boy , don ’ t oppose it , afterwards will be too late ; and I shan ’ t sleep all night , for I bought it by guess , without measure . Just right ! ” he cried triumphantly , fitting it on , “ just your size ! A proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in it own way . Tolstyakov , a friend of mine , is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he go into any public place where other people wear their hat or cap . People think he doe it from slavish politeness , but it ’ s simply because he is ashamed of his bird ’ s nest ; he is such a boastful fellow ! Look , Nastasya , here are two specimen of headgear : this Palmerston ” -- he took from the corner Raskolnikov ’ s old , battered hat , which for some unknown reason , he called a Palmerston -- “ or this jewel ! Guess the price , Rodya , what do you suppose I paid for it , Nastasya ! ” he said , turning to her , seeing that Raskolnikov did not speak . “ Twenty copeck , no more , I dare say , ” answered Nastasya . “ Twenty copeck , silly ! ” he cried , offended . “ Why , nowadays you would cost more than that -- eighty copeck ! And that only because it ha been worn . And it ’ s bought on condition that when ’ s it ’ s worn out , they will give you another next year . Yes , on my word ! Well , now let u pas to the United States of America , a they called them at school . I assure you I am proud of these breech , ” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a pair of light , summer trouser of grey woollen material . “ No hole , no spot , and quite respectable , although a little worn ; and a waistcoat to match , quite in the fashion . And it being worn really is an improvement , it ’ s softer , smoother .... You see , Rodya , to my thinking , the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the season ; if you don ’ t insist on having asparagus in January , you keep your money in your purse ; and it ’ s the same with this purchase . It ’ s summer now , so I ’ ve been buying summer thing -- warmer material will be wanted for autumn , so you will have to throw these away in any case ... especially a they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury . Come , price them ! What do you say ? Two rouble twenty-five copeck ! And remember the condition : if you wear these out , you will have another suit for nothing ! They only do business on that system at Fedyaev ’ s ; if you ’ ve bought a thing once , you are satisfied for life , for you will never go there again of your own free will . Now for the boot . What do you say ? You see that they are a bit worn , but they ’ ll last a couple of month , for it ’ s foreign work and foreign leather ; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week -- he had only worn them six day , but he wa very short of cash . Price -- a rouble and a half . A bargain ? ” “ But perhaps they won ’ t fit , ” observed Nastasya . “ Not fit ? Just look ! ” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov ’ s old , broken boot , stiffly coated with dry mud . “ I did not go empty-handed -- they took the size from this monster . We all did our best . And a to your linen , your landlady ha seen to that . Here , to begin with are three shirt , hempen but with a fashionable front .... Well now then , eighty copeck the cap , two rouble twenty-five copeck the suit -- together three rouble five copeck -- a rouble and a half for the boot -- for , you see , they are very good -- and that make four rouble fifty-five copeck ; five rouble for the underclothes -- they were bought in the lot -- which make exactly nine rouble fifty-five copeck . Forty-five copeck change in copper . Will you take it ? And so , Rodya , you are set up with a complete new rig-out , for your overcoat will serve , and even ha a style of it own . That come from getting one ’ s clothes from Sharmer ’ s ! As for your sock and other thing , I leave them to you ; we ’ ve twenty-five rouble left . And a for Pashenka and paying for your lodging , don ’ t you worry . I tell you she ’ ll trust you for anything . And now , brother , let me change your linen , for I daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt. ” “ Let me be ! I don ’ t want to ! ” Raskolnikov waved him off . He had listened with disgust to Razumihin ’ s effort to be playful about his purchase . “ Come , brother , don ’ t tell me I ’ ve been trudging around for nothing , ” Razumihin insisted . “ Nastasya , don ’ t be bashful , but help me -- that ’ s it , ” and in spite of Raskolnikov ’ s resistance he changed his linen . The latter sank back on the pillow and for a minute or two said nothing . “ It will be long before I get rid of them , ” he thought . “ What money wa all that bought with ? ” he asked at last , gazing at the wall . “ Money ? Why , your own , what the messenger brought from Vahrushin , your mother sent it . Have you forgotten that , too ? ” “ I remember now , ” said Raskolnikov after a long , sullen silence . Razumihin looked at him , frowning and uneasy . The door opened and a tall , stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to Raskolnikov came in . CHAPTER IV Zossimov wa a tall , fat man with a puffy , colourless , clean-shaven face and straight flaxen hair . He wore spectacle , and a big gold ring on his fat finger . He wa twenty-seven . He had on a light grey fashionable loose coat , light summer trouser , and everything about him loose , fashionable and spick and span ; his linen wa irreproachable , his watch-chain wa massive . In manner he wa slow and , a it were , nonchalant , and at the same time studiously free and easy ; he made effort to conceal his self-importance , but it wa apparent at every instant . All his acquaintance found him tedious , but said he wa clever at his work . “ I ’ ve been to you twice to-day , brother . You see , he ’ s come to himself , ” cried Razumihin . “ I see , I see ; and how do we feel now , eh ? ” said Zossimov to Raskolnikov , watching him carefully and , sitting down at the foot of the sofa , he settled himself a comfortably a he could . “ He is still depressed , ” Razumihin went on . “ We ’ ve just changed his linen and he almost cried. ” “ That ’ s very natural ; you might have put it off if he did not wish it .... His pulse is first-rate . Is your head still aching , eh ? ” “ I am well , I am perfectly well ! ” Raskolnikov declared positively and irritably . He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eye , but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall . Zossimov watched him intently . “ Very good .... Going on all right , ” he said lazily . “ Has he eaten anything ? ” They told him , and asked what he might have . “ He may have anything ... soup , tea ... mushroom and cucumber , of course , you must not give him ; he ’ d better not have meat either , and ... but no need to tell you that ! ” Razumihin and he looked at each other . “ No more medicine or anything . I ’ ll look at him again to-morrow . Perhaps , to-day even ... but never mind ... ” “ To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk , ” said Razumihin . “ We are going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal. ” “ I would not disturb him to-morrow at all , but I don ’ t know ... a little , maybe ... but we ’ ll see. ” “ Ach , what a nuisance ! I ’ ve got a house-warming party to-night ; it ’ s only a step from here . Couldn ’ t he come ? He could lie on the sofa . You are coming ? ” Razumihin said to Zossimov . “ Don ’ t forget , you promised. ” “ All right , only rather later . What are you going to do ? ” “ Oh , nothing -- tea , vodka , herring . There will be a pie ... just our friends. ” “ And who ? ” “ All neighbour here , almost all new friend , except my old uncle , and he is new too -- he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his . We meet once in five years. ” “ What is he ? ” “ He ’ s been stagnating all his life a a district postmaster ; get a little pension . He is sixty-five -- not worth talking about .... But I am fond of him . Porfiry Petrovitch , the head of the Investigation Department here ... But you know him. ” “ Is he a relation of yours , too ? ” “ A very distant one . But why are you scowling ? Because you quarrelled once , won ’ t you come then ? ” “ I don ’ t care a damn for him. ” “ So much the better . Well , there will be some student , a teacher , a government clerk , a musician , an officer and Zametov. ” “ Do tell me , please , what you or he ” -- Zossimov nodded at Raskolnikov -- “ can have in common with this Zametov ? ” “ Oh , you particular gentleman ! Principles ! You are worked by principle , a it were by spring ; you won ’ t venture to turn round on your own account . If a man is a nice fellow , that ’ s the only principle I go upon . Zametov is a delightful person. ” “ Though he doe take bribes. ” “ Well , he doe ! and what of it ? I don ’ t care if he doe take bribe , ” Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability . “ I don ’ t praise him for taking bribe . I only say he is a nice man in his own way ! But if one look at men in all way -- are there many good one left ? Why , I am sure I shouldn ’ t be worth a baked onion myself ... perhaps with you thrown in. ” “ That ’ s too little ; I ’ d give two for you. ” “ And I wouldn ’ t give more than one for you . No more of your joke ! Zametov is no more than a boy . I can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him . You ’ ll never improve a man by repelling him , especially a boy . One ha to be twice a careful with a boy . Oh , you progressive dullard ! You don ’ t understand . You harm yourselves running another man down .... But if you want to know , we really have something in common. ” “ I should like to know what. ” “ Why , it ’ s all about a house-painter .... We are getting him out of a mess ! Though indeed there ’ s nothing to fear now . The matter is absolutely self-evident . We only put on steam. ” “ A painter ? ” “ Why , haven ’ t I told you about it ? I only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman . Well , the painter is mixed up in it ... ” “ Oh , I heard about that murder before and wa rather interested in it ... partly ... for one reason .... I read about it in the paper , too .... ” “ Lizaveta wa murdered , too , ” Nastasya blurted out , suddenly addressing Raskolnikov . She remained in the room all the time , standing by the door listening . “ Lizaveta , ” murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly . “ Lizaveta , who sold old clothes . Didn ’ t you know her ? She used to come here . She mended a shirt for you , too. ” Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty , yellow paper he picked out one clumsy , white flower with brown line on it and began examining how many petal there were in it , how many scallop in the petal and how many line on them . He felt his arm and leg a lifeless a though they had been cut off . He did not attempt to move , but stared obstinately at the flower . “ But what about the painter ? ” Zossimov interrupted Nastasya ’ s chatter with marked displeasure . She sighed and wa silent . “ Why , he wa accused of the murder , ” Razumihin went on hotly . “ Was there evidence against him then ? ” “ Evidence , indeed ! Evidence that wa no evidence , and that ’ s what we have to prove . It wa just a they pitched on those fellow , Koch and Pestryakov , at first . Foo ! how stupidly it ’ s all done , it make one sick , though it ’ s not one ’ s business ! Pestryakov may be coming to-night .... By the way , Rodya , you ’ ve heard about the business already ; it happened before you were ill , the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it. ” Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov . He did not stir . “ But I say , Razumihin , I wonder at you . What a busybody you are ! ” Zossimov observed . “ Maybe I am , but we will get him off anyway , ” shouted Razumihin , bringing his fist down on the table . “ What ’ s the most offensive is not their lying -- one can always forgive lying -- lying is a delightful thing , for it lead to truth -- what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying .... I respect Porfiry , but ... What threw them out at first ? The door wa locked , and when they came back with the porter it wa open . So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the murderer -- that wa their logic ! ” “ But don ’ t excite yourself ; they simply detained them , they could not help that .... And , by the way , I ’ ve met that man Koch . He used to buy unredeemed pledge from the old woman ? Eh ? ” “ Yes , he is a swindler . He buy up bad debt , too . He make a profession of it . But enough of him ! Do you know what make me angry ? It ’ s their sickening rotten , petrified routine .... And this case might be the mean of introducing a new method . One can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man . ‘ We have fact , ’ they say . But fact are not everything -- at least half the business lie in how you interpret them ! ” “ Can you interpret them , then ? ” “ Anyway , one can ’ t hold one ’ s tongue when one ha a feeling , a tangible feeling , that one might be a help if only .... Eh ! Do you know the detail of the case ? ” “ I am waiting to hear about the painter. ” “ Oh , yes ! Well , here ’ s the story . Early on the third day after the murder , when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov -- though they accounted for every step they took and it wa a plain a a pikestaff -- an unexpected fact turned up . A peasant called Dushkin , who keep a dram-shop facing the house , brought to the police office a jeweller ’ s case containing some gold ear-rings , and told a long rigamarole . ‘ The day before yesterday , just after eight o ’ clock ’ -- mark the day and the hour ! -- ‘ a journeyman house-painter , Nikolay , who had been in to see me already that day , brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stone , and asked me to give him two rouble for them . When I asked him where he got them , he said that he picked them up in the street . I did not ask him anything more. ’ I am telling you Dushkin ’ s story . ‘ I gave him a note ’ -- a rouble that is -- ‘ for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another . It would all come to the same thing -- he ’ d spend it on drink , so the thing had better be with me . The further you hide it the quicker you will find it , and if anything turn up , if I hear any rumour , I ’ ll take it to the police. ’ Of course , that ’ s all taradiddle ; he lie like a horse , for I know this Dushkin , he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen good , and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police . He wa simply afraid . But no matter , to return to Dushkin ’ s story . ‘ I ’ ve known this peasant , Nikolay Dementyev , from a child ; he come from the same province and district of Zaraïsk , we are both Ryazan men . And though Nikolay is not a drunkard , he drink , and I knew he had a job in that house , painting work with Dmitri , who come from the same village , too . As soon a he got the rouble he changed it , had a couple of glass , took his change and went out . But I did not see Dmitri with him then . And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and her sister , Lizaveta Ivanovna , with an axe . I knew them , and I felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once , for I knew the murdered woman lent money on pledge . I went to the house , and began to make careful inquiry without saying a word to anyone . First of all I asked , “ Is Nikolay here ? ” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree ; he had come home at daybreak drunk , stayed in the house about ten minute , and went out again . Dmitri didn ’ t see him again and is finishing the job alone . And their job is on the same staircase a the murder , on the second floor . When I heard all that I did not say a word to anyone ’ -- that ’ s Dushkin ’ s tale -- ‘ but I found out what I could about the murder , and went home feeling a suspicious a ever . And at eight o ’ clock this morning ’ -- that wa the third day , you understand -- ‘ I saw Nikolay coming in , not sober , though not to say very drunk -- he could understand what wa said to him . He sat down on the bench and did not speak . There wa only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep on a bench and our two boy . “ Have you seen Dmitri ? ” said I . “ No , I haven ’ t , ” said he . “ And you ’ ve not been here either ? ” “ Not since the day before yesterday , ” said he . “ And where did you sleep last night ? ” “ In Peski , with the Kolomensky men. ” “ And where did you get those ear-rings ? ” I asked . “ I found them in the street , ” and the way he said it wa a bit queer ; he did not look at me . “ Did you hear what happened that very evening , at that very hour , on that same staircase ? ” said I . “ No , ” said he , “ I had not heard , ” and all the while he wa listening , his eye were staring out of his head and he turned a white a chalk . I told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up . I wanted to keep him . “ Wait a bit , Nikolay , ” said I , “ won ’ t you have a drink ? ” And I signed to the boy to hold the door , and I came out from behind the bar ; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run . I have not seen him since . Then my doubt were at an end -- it wa his doing , a clear a could be .... ’ ” “ I should think so , ” said Zossimov . “ Wait ! Hear the end . Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay ; they detained Dushkin and searched his house ; Dmitri , too , wa arrested ; the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out . And the day before yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town . He had gone there , taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it . They gave it to him . A few minute afterwards the woman went to the cowshed , and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam , stood on a block of wood , and wa trying to put his neck in the noose . The woman screeched her hardest ; people ran in . ‘ So that ’ s what you are up to ! ’ ‘ Take me , ’ he say , ‘ to such-and-such a police officer ; I ’ ll confess everything. ’ Well , they took him to that police station -- that is here -- with a suitable escort . So they asked him this and that , how old he is , ‘ twenty-two , ’ and so on . At the question , ‘ When you were working with Dmitri , didn ’ t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time ? ’ -- answer : ‘ To be sure folk may have gone up and down , but I did not notice them. ’ ‘ And didn ’ t you hear anything , any noise , and so on ? ’ ‘ We heard nothing special. ’ ‘ And did you hear , Nikolay , that on the same day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed ? ’ ‘ I never knew a thing about it . The first I heard of it wa from Afanasy Pavlovitch the day before yesterday. ’ ‘ And where did you find the ear-rings ? ’ ‘ I found them on the pavement. ’ ‘ Why didn ’ t you go to work with Dmitri the other day ? ’ ‘ Because I wa drinking. ’ ‘ And where were you drinking ? ’ ‘ Oh , in such-and-such a place. ’ ‘ Why did you run away from Dushkin ’ s ? ’ ‘ Because I wa awfully frightened. ’ ‘ What were you frightened of ? ’ ‘ That I should be accused. ’ ‘ How could you be frightened , if you felt free from guilt ? ’ Now , Zossimov , you may not believe me , that question wa put literally in those word . I know it for a fact , it wa repeated to me exactly ! What do you say to that ? ” “ Well , anyway , there ’ s the evidence. ” “ I am not talking of the evidence now , I am talking about that question , of their own idea of themselves . Well , so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed : ‘ I did not find it in the street , but in the flat where I wa painting with Dmitri. ’ ‘ And how wa that ? ’ ‘ Why , Dmitri and I were painting there all day , and we were just getting ready to go , and Dmitri took a brush and painted my face , and he ran off and I after him . I ran after him , shouting my hardest , and at the bottom of the stair I ran right against the porter and some gentleman -- and how many gentleman were there I don ’ t remember . And the porter swore at me , and the other porter swore , too , and the porter ’ s wife came out , and swore at u , too ; and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady , and he swore at u , too , for Dmitri and I lay right across the way . I got hold of Dmitri ’ s hair and knocked him down and began beating him . And Dmitri , too , caught me by the hair and began beating me . But we did it all not for temper but in a friendly way , for sport . And then Dmitri escaped and ran into the street , and I ran after him ; but I did not catch him , and went back to the flat alone ; I had to clear up my thing . I began putting them together , expecting Dmitri to come , and there in the passage , in the corner by the door , I stepped on the box . I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper . I took off the paper , saw some little hook , undid them , and in the box were the ear-rings .... ’ ” “ Behind the door ? Lying behind the door ? Behind the door ? ” Raskolnikov cried suddenly , staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin , and he slowly sat up on the sofa , leaning on his hand . “ Yes ... why ? What ’ s the matter ? What ’ s wrong ? ” Razumihin , too , got up from his seat . “ Nothing , ” Raskolnikov answered faintly , turning to the wall . All were silent for a while . “ He must have waked from a dream , ” Razumihin said at last , looking inquiringly at Zossimov . The latter slightly shook his head . “ Well , go on , ” said Zossimov . “ What next ? ” “ What next ? As soon a he saw the ear-rings , forgetting Dmitri and everything , he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and , a we know , got a rouble from him . He told a lie saying he found them in the street , and went off drinking . He keep repeating his old story about the murder : ‘ I know nothing of it , never heard of it till the day before yesterday. ’ ‘ And why didn ’ t you come to the police till now ? ’ ‘ I wa frightened. ’ ‘ And why did you try to hang yourself ? ’ ‘ From anxiety. ’ ‘ What anxiety ? ’ ‘ That I should be accused of it. ’ Well , that ’ s the whole story . And now what do you suppose they deduced from that ? ” “ Why , there ’ s no supposing . There ’ s a clue , such a it is , a fact . You wouldn ’ t have your painter set free ? ” “ Now they ’ ve simply taken him for the murderer . They haven ’ t a shadow of doubt. ” “ That ’ s nonsense . You are excited . But what about the ear-rings ? You must admit that , if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old woman ’ s box have come into Nikolay ’ s hand , they must have come there somehow . That ’ s a good deal in such a case. ” “ How did they get there ? How did they get there ? ” cried Razumihin . “ How can you , a doctor , whose duty it is to study man and who ha more opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature -- how can you fail to see the character of the man in the whole story ? Don ’ t you see at once that the answer he ha given in the examination are the holy truth ? They came into his hand precisely a he ha told u -- he stepped on the box and picked it up. ” “ The holy truth ! But didn ’ t he own himself that he told a lie at first ? ” “ Listen to me , listen attentively . The porter and Koch and Pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who wa sitting in the porter ’ s lodge and the man Kryukov , who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm , that is eight or ten witness , agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground , wa lying on him beating him , while Dmitri hung on to his hair , beating him , too . They lay right across the way , blocking the thoroughfare . They were sworn at on all side while they ‘ like child ’ ( the very word of the witness ) were falling over one another , squealing , fighting and laughing with the funniest face , and , chasing one another like child , they ran into the street . Now take careful note . The body upstairs were warm , you understand , warm when they found them ! If they , or Nikolay alone , had murdered them and broken open the box , or simply taken part in the robbery , allow me to ask you one question : do their state of mind , their squeal and giggle and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with ax , bloodshed , fiendish cunning , robbery ? They ’ d just killed them , not five or ten minute before , for the body were still warm , and at once , leaving the flat open , knowing that people would go there at once , flinging away their booty , they rolled about like child , laughing and attracting general attention . And there are a dozen witness to swear to that ! ” “ Of course it is strange ! It ’ s impossible , indeed , but ... ” “ No , brother , no _buts_ . And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay ’ s hand at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him -- although the explanation given by him account for it , and therefore it doe not tell seriously against him -- one must take into consideration the fact which prove him innocent , especially a they are fact that _cannot be denied_ . And do you suppose , from the character of our legal system , that they will accept , or that they are in a position to accept , this fact -- resting simply on a psychological impossibility -- a irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution ? No , they won ’ t accept it , they certainly won ’ t , because they found the jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself , ‘ which he could not have done if he hadn ’ t felt guilty. ’ That ’ s the point , that ’ s what excites me , you must understand ! ” “ Oh , I see you are excited ! Wait a bit . I forgot to ask you ; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman ? ” “ That ’ s been proved , ” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance , frowning . “ Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner , who proved conclusively that it wa his. ” “ That ’ s bad . Now another point . Did anyone see Nikolay at the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first , and is there no evidence about that ? ” “ Nobody did see him , ” Razumihin answered with vexation . “ That ’ s the worst of it . Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs , though , indeed , their evidence could not have been worth much . They said they saw the flat wa open , and that there must be work going on in it , but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were men at work in it. ” “ Hm ! ... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing . That constitutes a strong presumption , but ... How do you explain the fact yourself ? ” “ How do I explain them ? What is there to explain ? It ’ s clear . At any rate , the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear , and the jewel-case point to it . The real murderer dropped those ear-rings . The murderer wa upstairs , locked in , when Koch and Pestryakov knocked at the door . Koch , like an as , did not stay at the door ; so the murderer popped out and ran down , too ; for he had no other way of escape . He hid from Koch , Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it . He stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs , waited till they were out of hearing , and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri and Nikolay ran out into the street and there wa no one in the entry ; possibly he wa seen , but not noticed . There are lot of people going in and out . He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door , and did not notice he dropped them , because he had other thing to think of . The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that he did stand there .... That ’ s how I explain it. ” “ Too clever ! No , my boy , you ’ re too clever . That beat everything. ” “ But , why , why ? ” “ Why , because everything fit too well ... it ’ s too melodramatic. ” “ A-ach ! ” Razumihin wa exclaiming , but at that moment the door opened and a personage came in who wa a stranger to all present . CHAPTER V This wa a gentleman no longer young , of a stiff and portly appearance , and a cautious and sour countenance . He began by stopping short in the doorway , staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment , a though asking himself what sort of place he had come to . Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted , he scanned Raskolnikov ’ s low and narrow “ cabin. ” With the same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov , who lay undressed , dishevelled , unwashed , on his miserable dirty sofa , looking fixedly at him . Then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth , unkempt figure and unshaven face of Razumihin , who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat . A constrained silence lasted for a couple of minute , and then , a might be expected , some scene-shifting took place . Reflecting , probably from certain fairly unmistakable sign , that he would get nothing in this “ cabin ” by attempting to overawe them , the gentleman softened somewhat , and civilly , though with some severity , emphasising every syllable of his question , addressed Zossimov : “ Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov , a student , or formerly a student ? ” Zossimov made a slight movement , and would have answered , had not Razumihin anticipated him . “ Here he is lying on the sofa ! What do you want ? ” This familiar “ what do you want ” seemed to cut the ground from the foot of the pompous gentleman . He wa turning to Razumihin , but checked himself in time and turned to Zossimov again . “ This is Raskolnikov , ” mumbled Zossimov , nodding towards him . Then he gave a prolonged yawn , opening his mouth a wide a possible . Then he lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket , pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter ’ s case , opened it , looked at it and a slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back . Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking , on his back , gazing persistently , though without understanding , at the stranger . Now that his face wa turned away from the strange flower on the paper , it wa extremely pale and wore a look of anguish , a though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack . But the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention , then his wonder , then suspicion and even alarm . When Zossimov said “ This is Raskolnikov ” he jumped up quickly , sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant , but weak and breaking , voice articulated : “ Yes , I am Raskolnikov ! What do you want ? ” The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively : “ Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin . I believe I have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you ? ” But Raskolnikov , who had expected something quite different , gazed blankly and dreamily at him , making no reply , a though he heard the name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time . “ Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information ? ” asked Pyotr Petrovitch , somewhat disconcerted . In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow , put his hand behind his head and gazed at the ceiling . A look of dismay came into Luzhin ’ s face . Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever , and at last he showed unmistakable sign of embarrassment . “ I had presumed and calculated , ” he faltered , “ that a letter posted more than ten day , if not a fortnight ago ... ” “ I say , why are you standing in the doorway ? ” Razumihin interrupted suddenly . “ If you ’ ve something to say , sit down . Nastasya and you are so crowded . Nastasya , make room . Here ’ s a chair , thread your way in ! ” He moved his chair back from the table , made a little space between the table and his knee , and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to “ thread his way in. ” The minute wa so chosen that it wa impossible to refuse , and the visitor squeezed his way through , hurrying and stumbling . Reaching the chair , he sat down , looking suspiciously at Razumihin . “ No need to be nervous , ” the latter blurted out . “ Rodya ha been ill for the last five day and delirious for three , but now he is recovering and ha got an appetite . This is his doctor , who ha just had a look at him . I am a comrade of Rodya ’ s , like him , formerly a student , and now I am nursing him ; so don ’ t you take any notice of u , but go on with your business. ” “ Thank you . But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov . “ N-no , ” mumbled Zossimov ; “ you may amuse him. ” He yawned again . “ He ha been conscious a long time , since the morning , ” went on Razumihin , whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful , partly , perhaps , because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself a a student . “ Your mamma , ” began Luzhin . “ Hm ! ” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly . Luzhin looked at him inquiringly . “ That ’ s all right , go on. ” Luzhin shrugged his shoulder . “ Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I wa sojourning in her neighbourhood . On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few day to elapse before coming to see you , in order that I might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings ; but now , to my astonishment ... ” “ I know , I know ! ” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation . “ So you are the _fiancé_ ? I know , and that ’ s enough ! ” There wa no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s being offended this time , but he said nothing . He made a violent effort to understand what it all meant . There wa a moment ’ s silence . Meanwhile Raskolnikov , who had turned a little towards him when he answered , began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity , a though he had not had a good look at him yet , or a though something new had struck him ; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him . There certainly wa something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s whole appearance , something which seemed to justify the title of “ fiancé ” so unceremoniously applied to him . In the first place , it wa evident , far too much so indeed , that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few day in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed -- a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding , indeed . Even his own , perhaps too complacent , consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstance , seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé . All his clothes were fresh from the tailor ’ s and were all right , except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate . Even the stylish new round hat had the same significance . Pyotr Petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hand . The exquisite pair of lavender glove , real Louvain , told the same tale , if only from the fact of his not wearing them , but carrying them in his hand for show . Light and youthful colour predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s attire . He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade , light thin trouser , a waistcoat of the same , new and fine linen , a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripe on it , and the best of it wa , this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch . His very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his forty-five year at all time . His dark , mutton-chop whisker made an agreeable setting on both side , growing thickly upon his shining , clean-shaven chin . Even his hair , touched here and there with grey , though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser ’ s , did not give him a stupid appearance , a curled hair usually doe , by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day . If there really wa something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking and imposing countenance , it wa due to quite other cause . After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously , Raskolnikov smiled malignantly , sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling a before . But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddity . “ I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation , ” he began , again breaking the silence with an effort . “ If I had been aware of your illness I should have come earlier . But you know what business is . I have , too , a very important legal affair in the Senate , not to mention other preoccupation which you may well conjecture . I am expecting your mamma and sister any minute. ” Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak ; his face showed some excitement . Pyotr Petrovitch paused , waited , but a nothing followed , he went on : “ ... Any minute . I have found a lodging for them on their arrival. ” “ Where ? ” asked Raskolnikov weakly . “ Very near here , in Bakaleyev ’ s house. ” “ That ’ s in Voskresensky , ” put in Razumihin . “ There are two storey of room , let by a merchant called Yushin ; I ’ ve been there. ” “ Yes , room ... ” “ A disgusting place -- filthy , stinking and , what ’ s more , of doubtful character . Things have happened there , and there are all sort of queer people living there . And I went there about a scandalous business . It ’ s cheap , though ... ” “ I could not , of course , find out so much about it , for I am a stranger in Petersburg myself , ” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily . “ However , the two room are exceedingly clean , and a it is for so short a time ... I have already taken a permanent , that is , our future flat , ” he said , addressing Raskolnikov , “ and I am having it done up . And meanwhile I am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov , in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel ; it wa he who told me of Bakaleyev ’ s house , too ... ” “ Lebeziatnikov ? ” said Raskolnikov slowly , a if recalling something . “ Yes , Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov , a clerk in the Ministry . Do you know him ? ” “ Yes ... no , ” Raskolnikov answered . “ Excuse me , I fancied so from your inquiry . I wa once his guardian .... A very nice young man and advanced . I like to meet young people : one learns new thing from them. ” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all . “ How do you mean ? ” asked Razumihin . “ In the most serious and essential matter , ” Pyotr Petrovitch replied , a though delighted at the question . “ You see , it ’ s ten year since I visited Petersburg . All the novelty , reform , idea have reached u in the province , but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg . And it ’ s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation . And I confess I am delighted ... ” “ At what ? ” “ Your question is a wide one . I may be mistaken , but I fancy I find clearer view , more , so to say , criticism , more practicality ... ” “ That ’ s true , ” Zossimov let drop . “ Nonsense ! There ’ s no practicality. ” Razumihin flew at him . “ Practicality is a difficult thing to find ; it doe not drop down from heaven . And for the last two hundred year we have been divorced from all practical life . Ideas , if you like , are fermenting , ” he said to Pyotr Petrovitch , “ and desire for good exists , though it ’ s in a childish form , and honesty you may find , although there are crowd of brigand . Anyway , there ’ s no practicality . Practicality go well shod. ” “ I don ’ t agree with you , ” Pyotr Petrovitch replied , with evident enjoyment . “ Of course , people do get carried away and make mistake , but one must have indulgence ; those mistake are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment . If little ha been done , the time ha been but short ; of mean I will not speak . It ’ s my personal view , if you care to know , that something ha been accomplished already . New valuable idea , new valuable work are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic author . Literature is taking a maturer form , many injurious prejudice have been rooted up and turned into ridicule .... In a word , we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past , and that , to my thinking , is a great thing ... ” “ He ’ s learnt it by heart to show off ! ” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly . “ What ? ” asked Pyotr Petrovitch , not catching his word ; but he received no reply . “ That ’ s all true , ” Zossimov hastened to interpose . “ Isn ’ t it so ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch went on , glancing affably at Zossimov . “ You must admit , ” he went on , addressing Razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness -- he almost added “ young man ” -- “ that there is an advance , or , a they say now , progress in the name of science and economic truth ... ” “ A commonplace. ” “ No , not a commonplace ! Hitherto , for instance , if I were told , ‘ love thy neighbour , ’ what came of it ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch went on , perhaps with excessive haste . “ It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked . As a Russian proverb ha it , ‘ Catch several hare and you won ’ t catch one. ’ Science now tell u , love yourself before all men , for everything in the world rest on self-interest . You love yourself and manage your own affair properly and your coat remains whole . Economic truth add that the better private affair are organised in society -- the more whole coat , so to say -- the firmer are it foundation and the better is the common welfare organised too . Therefore , in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself , I am acquiring , so to speak , for all , and helping to bring to pas my neighbour ’ s getting a little more than a torn coat ; and that not from private , personal liberality , but a a consequence of the general advance . The idea is simple , but unhappily it ha been a long time reaching u , being hindered by idealism and sentimentality . And yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it ... ” “ Excuse me , I ’ ve very little wit myself , ” Razumihin cut in sharply , “ and so let u drop it . I began this discussion with an object , but I ’ ve grown so sick during the last three year of this chattering to amuse oneself , of this incessant flow of commonplace , always the same , that , by Jove , I blush even when other people talk like that . You are in a hurry , no doubt , to exhibit your acquirement ; and I don ’ t blame you , that ’ s quite pardonable . I only wanted to find out what sort of man you are , for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interest everything they touched , that the whole cause ha been dragged in the mire . That ’ s enough ! ” “ Excuse me , sir , ” said Luzhin , affronted , and speaking with excessive dignity . “ Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too ... ” “ Oh , my dear sir ... how could I ? ... Come , that ’ s enough , ” Razumihin concluded , and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous conversation . Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal . He made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two . “ I trust our acquaintance , ” he said , addressing Raskolnikov , “ may , upon your recovery and in view of the circumstance of which you are aware , become closer ... Above all , I hope for your return to health ... ” Raskolnikov did not even turn his head . Pyotr Petrovitch began getting up from his chair . “ One of her customer must have killed her , ” Zossimov declared positively . “ Not a doubt of it , ” replied Razumihin . “ Porfiry doesn ’ t give his opinion , but is examining all who have left pledge with her there. ” “ Examining them ? ” Raskolnikov asked aloud . “ Yes . What then ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ How doe he get hold of them ? ” asked Zossimov . “ Koch ha given the name of some of them , other name are on the wrapper of the pledge and some have come forward of themselves. ” “ It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian ! The boldness of it ! The coolness ! ” “ That ’ s just what it wasn ’ t ! ” interposed Razumihin . “ That ’ s what throw you all off the scent . But I maintain that he is not cunning , not practised , and probably this wa his first crime ! The supposition that it wa a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn ’ t work . Suppose him to have been inexperienced , and it ’ s clear that it wa only a chance that saved him -- and chance may do anything . Why , he did not foresee obstacle , perhaps ! And how did he set to work ? He took jewel worth ten or twenty rouble , stuffing his pocket with them , ransacked the old woman ’ s trunk , her rag -- and they found fifteen hundred rouble , besides note , in a box in the top drawer of the chest ! He did not know how to rob ; he could only murder . It wa his first crime , I assure you , his first crime ; he lost his head . And he got off more by luck than good counsel ! ” “ You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker , I believe ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch put in , addressing Zossimov . He wa standing , hat and glove in hand , but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrase . He wa evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence . “ Yes . You ’ ve heard of it ? ” “ Oh , yes , being in the neighbourhood. ” “ Do you know the detail ? ” “ I can ’ t say that ; but another circumstance interest me in the case -- the whole question , so to say . Not to speak of the fact that crime ha been greatly on the increase among the lower class during the last five year , not to speak of the case of robbery and arson everywhere , what strike me a the strangest thing is that in the higher class , too , crime is increasing proportionately . In one place one hears of a student ’ s robbing the mail on the high road ; in another place people of good social position forge false banknote ; in Moscow of late a whole gang ha been captured who used to forge lottery ticket , and one of the ringleader wa a lecturer in universal history ; then our secretary abroad wa murdered from some obscure motive of gain .... And if this old woman , the pawnbroker , ha been murdered by someone of a higher class in society -- for peasant don ’ t pawn gold trinket -- how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society ? ” “ There are many economic change , ” put in Zossimov . “ How are we to explain it ? ” Razumihin caught him up . “ It might be explained by our inveterate impracticality. ” “ How do you mean ? ” “ What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he wa forging note ? ‘ Everybody is getting rich one way or another , so I want to make haste to get rich too. ’ I don ’ t remember the exact word , but the upshot wa that he want money for nothing , without waiting or working ! We ’ ve grown used to having everything ready-made , to walking on crutch , to having our food chewed for u . Then the great hour struck , [ * ] and every man showed himself in his true colours. ” [ * ] The emancipation of the serf in 1861 is meant . -- TRANSLATOR ’ S NOTE . “ But morality ? And so to speak , principle ... ” “ But why do you worry about it ? ” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly . “ It ’ s in accordance with your theory ! ” “ In accordance with my theory ? ” “ Why , carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now , and it follows that people may be killed ... ” “ Upon my word ! ” cried Luzhin . “ No , that ’ s not so , ” put in Zossimov . Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip , breathing painfully . “ There ’ s a measure in all thing , ” Luzhin went on superciliously . “ Economic idea are not an incitement to murder , and one ha but to suppose ... ” “ And is it true , ” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly , again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him , “ is it true that you told your _fiancée_ ... within an hour of her acceptance , that what pleased you most ... wa that she wa a beggar ... because it wa better to raise a wife from poverty , so that you may have complete control over her , and reproach her with your being her benefactor ? ” “ Upon my word , ” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably , crimson with confusion , “ to distort my word in this way ! Excuse me , allow me to assure you that the report which ha reached you , or rather , let me say , ha been conveyed to you , ha no foundation in truth , and I ... suspect who ... in a word ... this arrow ... in a word , your mamma ... She seemed to me in other thing , with all her excellent quality , of a somewhat high-flown and romantic way of thinking .... But I wa a thousand mile from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent thing in so fanciful a way .... And indeed ... indeed ... ” “ I tell you what , ” cried Raskolnikov , raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing , glittering eye upon him , “ I tell you what. ” “ What ? ” Luzhin stood still , waiting with a defiant and offended face . Silence lasted for some second . “ Why , if ever again ... you dare to mention a single word ... about my mother ... I shall send you flying downstairs ! ” “ What ’ s the matter with you ? ” cried Razumihin . “ So that ’ s how it is ? ” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip . “ Let me tell you , sir , ” he began deliberately , doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard , “ at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed to me , but I remained here on purpose to find out more . I could forgive a great deal in a sick man and a connection , but you ... never after this ... ” “ I am not ill , ” cried Raskolnikov . “ So much the worse ... ” “ Go to hell ! ” But Luzhin wa already leaving without finishing his speech , squeezing between the table and the chair ; Razumihin got up this time to let him pas . Without glancing at anyone , and not even nodding to Zossimov , who had for some time been making sign to him to let the sick man alone , he went out , lifting his hat to the level of his shoulder to avoid crushing it a he stooped to go out of the door . And even the curve of his spine wa expressive of the horrible insult he had received . “ How could you -- how could you ! ” Razumihin said , shaking his head in perplexity . “ Let me alone -- let me alone all of you ! ” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy . “ Will you ever leave off tormenting me ? I am not afraid of you ! I am not afraid of anyone , anyone now ! Get away from me ! I want to be alone , alone , alone ! ” “ Come along , ” said Zossimov , nodding to Razumihin . “ But we can ’ t leave him like this ! ” “ Come along , ” Zossimov repeated insistently , and he went out . Razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him . “ It might be worse not to obey him , ” said Zossimov on the stair . “ He mustn ’ t be irritated. ” “ What ’ s the matter with him ? ” “ If only he could get some favourable shock , that ’ s what would do it ! At first he wa better .... You know he ha got something on his mind ! Some fixed idea weighing on him .... I am very much afraid so ; he must have ! ” “ Perhaps it ’ s that gentleman , Pyotr Petrovitch . From his conversation I gather he is going to marry his sister , and that he had received a letter about it just before his illness .... ” “ Yes , confound the man ! he may have upset the case altogether . But have you noticed , he take no interest in anything , he doe not respond to anything except one point on which he seems excited -- that ’ s the murder ? ” “ Yes , yes , ” Razumihin agreed , “ I noticed that , too . He is interested , frightened . It gave him a shock on the day he wa ill in the police office ; he fainted. ” “ Tell me more about that this evening and I ’ ll tell you something afterwards . He interest me very much ! In half an hour I ’ ll go and see him again .... There ’ ll be no inflammation though. ” “ Thanks ! And I ’ ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him through Nastasya .... ” Raskolnikov , left alone , looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya , but she still lingered . “ Won ’ t you have some tea now ? ” she asked . “ Later ! I am sleepy ! Leave me. ” He turned abruptly to the wall ; Nastasya went out . CHAPTER VI But a soon a she went out , he got up , latched the door , undid the parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again and began dressing . Strange to say , he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm ; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late . It wa the first moment of a strange sudden calm . His movement were precise and definite ; a firm purpose wa evident in them . “ To-day , to-day , ” he muttered to himself . He understood that he wa still weak , but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and self-confidence . He hoped , moreover , that he would not fall down in the street . When he had dressed in entirely new clothes , he looked at the money lying on the table , and after a moment ’ s thought put it in his pocket . It wa twenty-five rouble . He took also all the copper change from the ten rouble spent by Razumihin on the clothes . Then he softly unlatched the door , went out , slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door . Nastasya wa standing with her back to him , blowing up the landlady ’ s samovar . She heard nothing . Who would have dreamed of his going out , indeed ? A minute later he wa in the street . It wa nearly eight o ’ clock , the sun wa setting . It wa a stifling a before , but he eagerly drank in the stinking , dusty town air . His head felt rather dizzy ; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eye and his wasted , pale and yellow face . He did not know and did not think where he wa going , he had one thought only : “ that all _this_ must be ended to-day , once for all , immediately ; that he would not return home without it , because he _would not go on living like that_. ” How , with what to make an end ? He had not an idea about it , he did not even want to think of it . He drove away thought ; thought tortured him . All he knew , all he felt wa that everything must be changed “ one way or another , ” he repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence and determination . From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay Market . A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ wa standing in the road in front of a little general shop and wa grinding out a very sentimental song . He wa accompanying a girl of fifteen , who stood on the pavement in front of him . She wa dressed up in a crinoline , a mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it , all very old and shabby . In a strong and rather agreeable voice , cracked and coarsened by street singing , she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop . Raskolnikov joined two or three listener , took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl ’ s hand . She broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note , shouted sharply to the organ grinder “ Come on , ” and both moved on to the next shop . “ Do you like street music ? ” said Raskolnikov , addressing a middle-aged man standing idly by him . The man looked at him , startled and wondering . “ I love to hear singing to a street organ , ” said Raskolnikov , and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject -- “ I like it on cold , dark , damp autumn evening -- they must be damp -- when all the passer-by have pale green , sickly face , or better still when wet snow is falling straight down , when there ’ s no wind -- you know what I mean ? -- and the street lamp shine through it ... ” “ I don ’ t know .... Excuse me ... ” muttered the stranger , frightened by the question and Raskolnikov ’ s strange manner , and he crossed over to the other side of the street . Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay Market , where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta ; but they were not there now . Recognising the place , he stopped , looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler ’ s shop . “ Isn ’ t there a man who keep a booth with his wife at this corner ? ” “ All sort of people keep booth here , ” answered the young man , glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov . “ What ’ s his name ? ” “ What he wa christened. ” “ Aren ’ t you a Zaraïsky man , too ? Which province ? ” The young man looked at Raskolnikov again . “ It ’ s not a province , your excellency , but a district . Graciously forgive me , your excellency ! ” “ Is that a tavern at the top there ? ” “ Yes , it ’ s an eating-house and there ’ s a billiard-room and you ’ ll find princess there too .... La-la ! ” Raskolnikov crossed the square . In that corner there wa a dense crowd of peasant . He pushed his way into the thickest part of it , looking at the face . He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people . But the peasant took no notice of him ; they were all shouting in group together . He stood and thought a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of V. He had often crossed that little street which turn at an angle , leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street . Of late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district , when he felt depressed , that he might feel more so . Now he walked along , thinking of nothing . At that point there is a great block of building , entirely let out in dram shop and eating-houses ; woman were continually running in and out , bare-headed and in their indoor clothes . Here and there they gathered in group , on the pavement , especially about the entrance to various festive establishment in the lower storey . From one of these a loud din , sound of singing , the tinkling of a guitar and shout of merriment , floated into the street . A crowd of woman were thronging round the door ; some were sitting on the step , others on the pavement , others were standing talking . A drunken soldier , smoking a cigarette , wa walking near them in the road , swearing ; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere , but had forgotten where . One beggar wa quarrelling with another , and a man dead drunk wa lying right across the road . Raskolnikov joined the throng of woman , who were talking in husky voice . They were bare-headed and wore cotton dress and goatskin shoe . There were woman of forty and some not more than seventeen ; almost all had blackened eye . He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below .... someone could be heard within dancing frantically , marking time with his heel to the sound of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air . He listened intently , gloomily and dreamily , bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement . “ Oh , my handsome soldier Don ’ t beat me for nothing , ” trilled the thin voice of the singer . Raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he wa singing , a though everything depended on that . “ Shall I go in ? ” he thought . “ They are laughing . From drink . Shall I get drunk ? ” “ Won ’ t you come in ? ” one of the woman asked him . Her voice wa still musical and le thick than the others , she wa young and not repulsive -- the only one of the group . “ Why , she ’ s pretty , ” he said , drawing himself up and looking at her . She smiled , much pleased at the compliment . “ You ’ re very nice looking yourself , ” she said . “ Isn ’ t he thin though ! ” observed another woman in a deep bass . “ Have you just come out of a hospital ? ” “ They ’ re all general ’ daughter , it seems , but they have all snub nose , ” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face , wearing a loose coat . “ See how jolly they are. ” “ Go along with you ! ” “ I ’ ll go , sweetie ! ” And he darted down into the saloon below . Raskolnikov moved on . “ I say , sir , ” the girl shouted after him . “ What is it ? ” She hesitated . “ I ’ ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you , kind gentleman , but now I feel shy . Give me six copeck for a drink , there ’ s a nice young man ! ” Raskolnikov gave her what came first -- fifteen copeck . “ Ah , what a good-natured gentleman ! ” “ What ’ s your name ? ” “ Ask for Duclida. ” “ Well , that ’ s too much , ” one of the woman observed , shaking her head at Duclida . “ I don ’ t know how you can ask like that . I believe I should drop with shame .... ” Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker . She wa a pock-marked wench of thirty , covered with bruise , with her upper lip swollen . She made her criticism quietly and earnestly . “ Where is it , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Where is it I ’ ve read that someone condemned to death say or think , an hour before his death , that if he had to live on some high rock , on such a narrow ledge that he ’ d only room to stand , and the ocean , everlasting darkness , everlasting solitude , everlasting tempest around him , if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life , a thousand year , eternity , it were better to live so than to die at once ! Only to live , to live and live ! Life , whatever it may be ! ... How true it is ! Good God , how true ! Man is a vile creature ! ... And vile is he who call him vile for that , ” he added a moment later . He went into another street . “ Bah , the Palais de Cristal ! Razumihin wa just talking of the Palais de Cristal . But what on earth wa it I wanted ? Yes , the newspaper .... Zossimov said he ’ d read it in the paper . Have you the paper ? ” he asked , going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant , consisting of several room , which were , however , rather empty . Two or three people were drinking tea , and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne . Raskolnikov fancied that Zametov wa one of them , but he could not be sure at that distance . “ What if it is ? ” he thought . “ Will you have vodka ? ” asked the waiter . “ Give me some tea and bring me the paper , the old one for the last five day , and I ’ ll give you something. ” “ Yes , sir , here ’ s to-day ’ s . No vodka ? ” The old newspaper and the tea were brought . Raskolnikov sat down and began to look through them . “ Oh , damn ... these are the item of intelligence . An accident on a staircase , spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol , a fire in Peski ... a fire in the Petersburg quarter ... another fire in the Petersburg quarter ... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter .... Ah , here it is ! ” He found at last what he wa seeking and began to read it . The line danced before his eye , but he read it all and began eagerly seeking later addition in the following number . His hand shook with nervous impatience a he turned the sheet . Suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table . He looked up , it wa the head clerk Zametov , looking just the same , with the ring on his finger and the watch-chain , with the curly , black hair , parted and pomaded , with the smart waistcoat , rather shabby coat and doubtful linen . He wa in a good humour , at least he wa smiling very gaily and good-humouredly . His dark face wa rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk . “ What , you here ? ” he began in surprise , speaking a though he ’ d known him all his life . “ Why , Razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious . How strange ! And do you know I ’ ve been to see you ? ” Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him . He laid aside the paper and turned to Zametov . There wa a smile on his lip , and a new shade of irritable impatience wa apparent in that smile . “ I know you have , ” he answered . “ I ’ ve heard it . You looked for my sock .... And you know Razumihin ha lost his heart to you ? He say you ’ ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna ’ s -- you know , the woman you tried to befriend , for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he would not understand . Do you remember ? How could he fail to understand -- it wa quite clear , wasn ’ t it ? ” “ What a hot head he is ! ” “ The explosive one ? ” “ No , your friend Razumihin. ” “ You must have a jolly life , Mr. Zametov ; entrance free to the most agreeable place . Who ’ s been pouring champagne into you just now ? ” “ We ’ ve just been ... having a drink together .... You talk about pouring it into me ! ” “ By way of a fee ! You profit by everything ! ” Raskolnikov laughed , “ it ’ s all right , my dear boy , ” he added , slapping Zametov on the shoulder . “ I am not speaking from temper , but in a friendly way , for sport , a that workman of yours said when he wa scuffling with Dmitri , in the case of the old woman .... ” “ How do you know about it ? ” “ Perhaps I know more about it than you do. ” “ How strange you are .... I am sure you are still very unwell . You oughtn ’ t to have come out. ” “ Oh , do I seem strange to you ? ” “ Yes . What are you doing , reading the paper ? ” “ Yes. ” “ There ’ s a lot about the fires. ” “ No , I am not reading about the fires. ” Here he looked mysteriously at Zametov ; his lip were twisted again in a mocking smile . “ No , I am not reading about the fire , ” he went on , winking at Zametov . “ But confess now , my dear fellow , you ’ re awfully anxious to know what I am reading about ? ” “ I am not in the least . Mayn ’ t I ask a question ? Why do you keep on ... ? ” “ Listen , you are a man of culture and education ? ” “ I wa in the sixth class at the gymnasium , ” said Zametov with some dignity . “ Sixth class ! Ah , my cock-sparrow ! With your parting and your ring -- you are a gentleman of fortune . Foo ! what a charming boy ! ” Here Raskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov ’ s face . The latter drew back , more amazed than offended . “ Foo ! how strange you are ! ” Zametov repeated very seriously . “ I can ’ t help thinking you are still delirious. ” “ I am delirious ? You are fibbing , my cock-sparrow ! So I am strange ? You find me curious , do you ? ” “ Yes , curious. ” “ Shall I tell you what I wa reading about , what I wa looking for ? See what a lot of paper I ’ ve made them bring me . Suspicious , eh ? ” “ Well , what is it ? ” “ You prick up your ear ? ” “ How do you mean -- ‘ prick up my ear ’ ? ” “ I ’ ll explain that afterwards , but now , my boy , I declare to you ... no , better ‘ I confess ’ ... No , that ’ s not right either ; ‘ I make a deposition and you take it. ’ I depose that I wa reading , that I wa looking and searching .... ” he screwed up his eye and paused . “ I wa searching -- and came here on purpose to do it -- for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman , ” he articulated at last , almost in a whisper , bringing his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov . Zametov looked at him steadily , without moving or drawing his face away . What struck Zametov afterwards a the strangest part of it all wa that silence followed for exactly a minute , and that they gazed at one another all the while . “ What if you have been reading about it ? ” he cried at last , perplexed and impatient . “ That ’ s no business of mine ! What of it ? ” “ The same old woman , ” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper , not heeding Zametov ’ s explanation , “ about whom you were talking in the police-office , you remember , when I fainted . Well , do you understand now ? ” “ What do you mean ? Understand ... what ? ” Zametov brought out , almost alarmed . Raskolnikov ’ s set and earnest face wa suddenly transformed , and he suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh a before , a though utterly unable to restrain himself . And in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past , that moment when he stood with the axe behind the door , while the latch trembled and the men outside swore and shook it , and he had a sudden desire to shout at them , to swear at them , to put out his tongue at them , to mock them , to laugh , and laugh , and laugh ! “ You are either mad , or ... ” began Zametov , and he broke off , a though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind . “ Or ? Or what ? What ? Come , tell me ! ” “ Nothing , ” said Zametov , getting angry , “ it ’ s all nonsense ! ” Both were silent . After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy . He put his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand . He seemed to have completely forgotten Zametov . The silence lasted for some time . “ Why don ’ t you drink your tea ? It ’ s getting cold , ” said Zametov . “ What ! Tea ? Oh , yes .... ” Raskolnikov sipped the glass , put a morsel of bread in his mouth and , suddenly looking at Zametov , seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together . At the same moment his face resumed it original mocking expression . He went on drinking tea . “ There have been a great many of these crime lately , ” said Zametov . “ Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of false coiner had been caught in Moscow . It wa a regular society . They used to forge ticket ! ” “ Oh , but it wa a long time ago ! I read about it a month ago , ” Raskolnikov answered calmly . “ So you consider them criminal ? ” he added , smiling . “ Of course they are criminals. ” “ They ? They are child , simpleton , not criminal ! Why , half a hundred people meeting for such an object -- what an idea ! Three would be too many , and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves ! One ha only to blab in his cup and it all collapse . Simpletons ! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the note -- what a thing to trust to a casual stranger ! Well , let u suppose that these simpleton succeed and each make a million , and what follows for the rest of their life ? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life ! Better hang oneself at once ! And they did not know how to change the note either ; the man who changed the note took five thousand rouble , and his hand trembled . He counted the first four thousand , but did not count the fifth thousand -- he wa in such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away . Of course he roused suspicion . And the whole thing came to a crash through one fool ! Is it possible ? ” “ That his hand trembled ? ” observed Zametov , “ yes , that ’ s quite possible . That , I feel quite sure , is possible . Sometimes one can ’ t stand things. ” “ Can ’ t stand that ? ” “ Why , could you stand it then ? No , I couldn ’ t . For the sake of a hundred rouble to face such a terrible experience ? To go with false note into a bank where it ’ s their business to spot that sort of thing ! No , I should not have the face to do it . Would you ? ” Raskolnikov had an intense desire again “ to put his tongue out. ” Shivers kept running down his spine . “ I should do it quite differently , ” Raskolnikov began . “ This is how I would change the note : I ’ d count the first thousand three or four time backwards and forward , looking at every note and then I ’ d set to the second thousand ; I ’ d count that half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note to the light , then turn it , then hold it to the light again -- to see whether it wa a good one . ‘ I am afraid , ’ I would say , ‘ a relation of mine lost twenty-five rouble the other day through a false note , ’ and then I ’ d tell them the whole story . And after I began counting the third , ‘ No , excuse me , ’ I would say , ‘ I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand , I am not sure. ’ And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end . And when I had finished , I ’ d pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again , ‘ Change them , please , ’ and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me . When I ’ d finished and had gone out , I ’ d come back , ‘ No , excuse me , ’ and ask for some explanation . That ’ s how I ’ d do it. ” “ Foo ! what terrible thing you say ! ” said Zametov , laughing . “ But all that is only talk . I dare say when it came to deed you ’ d make a slip . I believe that even a practised , desperate man can not always reckon on himself , much le you and I . To take an example near home -- that old woman murdered in our district . The murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow , he risked everything in open daylight , wa saved by a miracle -- but his hand shook , too . He did not succeed in robbing the place , he couldn ’ t stand it . That wa clear from the ... ” Raskolnikov seemed offended . “ Clear ? Why don ’ t you catch him then ? ” he cried , maliciously gibing at Zametov . “ Well , they will catch him. ” “ Who ? You ? Do you suppose you could catch him ? You ’ ve a tough job ! A great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not . If he had no money and suddenly begin spending , he must be the man . So that any child can mislead you. ” “ The fact is they always do that , though , ” answered Zametov . “ A man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he go drinking in a tavern . They are caught spending money , they are not all a cunning a you are . You wouldn ’ t go to a tavern , of course ? ” Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov . “ You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should behave in that case , too ? ” he asked with displeasure . “ I should like to , ” Zametov answered firmly and seriously . Somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his word and look . “ Very much ? ” “ Very much ! ” “ All right then . This is how I should behave , ” Raskolnikov began , again bringing his face close to Zametov ’ s , again staring at him and speaking in a whisper , so that the latter positively shuddered . “ This is what I should have done . I should have taken the money and jewel , I should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fence round it and scarcely anyone to be seen , some kitchen garden or place of that sort . I should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house wa built . I would lift that stone -- there would sure to be a hollow under it , and I would put the jewel and money in that hole . Then I ’ d roll the stone back so that it would look a before , would press it down with my foot and walk away . And for a year or two , three maybe , I would not touch it . And , well , they could search ! There ’ d be no trace. ” “ You are a madman , ” said Zametov , and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper , and moved away from Raskolnikov , whose eye were glittering . He had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip wa twitching and quivering . He bent down a close a possible to Zametov , and his lip began to move without uttering a word . This lasted for half a minute ; he knew what he wa doing , but could not restrain himself . The terrible word trembled on his lip , like the latch on that door ; in another moment it will break out , in another moment he will let it go , he will speak out . “ And what if it wa I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta ? ” he said suddenly and -- realised what he had done . Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white a the tablecloth . His face wore a contorted smile . “ But is it possible ? ” he brought out faintly . Raskolnikov looked wrathfully at him . “ Own up that you believed it , yes , you did ? ” “ Not a bit of it , I believe it le than ever now , ” Zametov cried hastily . “ I ’ ve caught my cock-sparrow ! So you did believe it before , if now you believe le than ever ? ” “ Not at all , ” cried Zametov , obviously embarrassed . “ Have you been frightening me so a to lead up to this ? ” “ You don ’ t believe it then ? What were you talking about behind my back when I went out of the police-office ? And why did the explosive lieutenant question me after I fainted ? Hey , there , ” he shouted to the waiter , getting up and taking his cap , “ how much ? ” “ Thirty copeck , ” the latter replied , running up . “ And there is twenty copeck for vodka . See what a lot of money ! ” he held out his shaking hand to Zametov with note in it . “ Red note and blue , twenty-five rouble . Where did I get them ? And where did my new clothes come from ? You know I had not a copeck . You ’ ve cross-examined my landlady , I ’ ll be bound .... Well , that ’ s enough ! _Assez causé ! _ Till we meet again ! ” He went out , trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation , in which there wa an element of insufferable rapture . Yet he wa gloomy and terribly tired . His face wa twisted a after a fit . His fatigue increased rapidly . Any shock , any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energy at once , but his strength failed a quickly when the stimulus wa removed . Zametov , left alone , sat for a long time in the same place , plunged in thought . Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively . “ Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead , ” he decided . Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he stumbled against Razumihin on the step . They did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other . For a moment they stood looking each other up and down . Razumihin wa greatly astounded , then anger , real anger gleamed fiercely in his eye . “ So here you are ! ” he shouted at the top of his voice -- “ you ran away from your bed ! And here I ’ ve been looking for you under the sofa ! We went up to the garret . I almost beat Nastasya on your account . And here he is after all . Rodya ! What is the meaning of it ? Tell me the whole truth ! Confess ! Do you hear ? ” “ It mean that I ’ m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone , ” Raskolnikov answered calmly . “ Alone ? When you are not able to walk , when your face is a white a a sheet and you are gasping for breath ! Idiot ! ... What have you been doing in the Palais de Cristal ? Own up at once ! ” “ Let me go ! ” said Raskolnikov and tried to pas him . This wa too much for Razumihin ; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder . “ Let you go ? You dare tell me to let you go ? Do you know what I ’ ll do with you directly ? I ’ ll pick you up , tie you up in a bundle , carry you home under my arm and lock you up ! ” “ Listen , Razumihin , ” Raskolnikov began quietly , apparently calm -- “ can ’ t you see that I don ’ t want your benevolence ? A strange desire you have to shower benefit on a man who ... curse them , who feel them a burden in fact ! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness ? Maybe I wa very glad to die . Didn ’ t I tell you plainly enough to-day that you were torturing me , that I wa ... sick of you ! You seem to want to torture people ! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery , because it ’ s continually irritating me . You saw Zossimov went away just now to avoid irritating me . You leave me alone too , for goodness ’ sake ! What right have you , indeed , to keep me by force ? Don ’ t you see that I am in possession of all my faculty now ? How , how can I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness ? I may be ungrateful , I may be mean , only let me be , for God ’ s sake , let me be ! Let me be , let me be ! ” He began calmly , gloating beforehand over the venomous phrase he wa about to utter , but finished , panting for breath , in a frenzy , a he had been with Luzhin . Razumihin stood a moment , thought and let his hand drop . “ Well , go to hell then , ” he said gently and thoughtfully . “ Stay , ” he roared , a Raskolnikov wa about to move . “ Listen to me . Let me tell you , that you are all a set of babbling , posing idiot ! If you ’ ve any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg . And you are plagiarist even in that ! There isn ’ t a sign of independent life in you ! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you ’ ve lymph in your vein instead of blood . I don ’ t believe in anyone of you ! In any circumstance the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being ! Stop ! ” he cried with redoubled fury , noticing that Raskolnikov wa again making a movement -- “ hear me out ! You know I ’ m having a house-warming this evening , I dare say they ’ ve arrived by now , but I left my uncle there -- I just ran in -- to receive the guest . And if you weren ’ t a fool , a common fool , a perfect fool , if you were an original instead of a translation ... you see , Rodya , I recognise you ’ re a clever fellow , but you ’ re a fool ! -- and if you weren ’ t a fool you ’ d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boot in the street ! Since you have gone out , there ’ s no help for it ! I ’ d give you a snug easy chair , my landlady ha one ... a cup of tea , company .... Or you could lie on the sofa -- any way you would be with u .... Zossimov will be there too . Will you come ? ” “ No. ” “ R-rubbish ! ” Razumihin shouted , out of patience . “ How do you know ? You can ’ t answer for yourself ! You don ’ t know anything about it .... Thousands of time I ’ ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards .... One feel ashamed and go back to a man ! So remember , Potchinkov ’ s house on the third storey .... ” “ Why , Mr. Razumihin , I do believe you ’ d let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence. ” “ Beat ? Whom ? Me ? I ’ d twist his nose off at the mere idea ! Potchinkov ’ s house , 47 , Babushkin ’ s flat .... ” “ I shall not come , Razumihin. ” Raskolnikov turned and walked away . “ I bet you will , ” Razumihin shouted after him . “ I refuse to know you if you don ’ t ! Stay , hey , is Zametov in there ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Did you see him ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Talked to him ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What about ? Confound you , don ’ t tell me then . Potchinkov ’ s house , 47 , Babushkin ’ s flat , remember ! ” Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street . Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully . Then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stair . “ Confound it , ” he went on almost aloud . “ He talked sensibly but yet ... I am a fool ! As if madman didn ’ t talk sensibly ! And this wa just what Zossimov seemed afraid of. ” He struck his finger on his forehead . “ What if ... how could I let him go off alone ? He may drown himself .... Ach , what a blunder ! I can ’ t. ” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov , but there wa no trace of him . With a curse he returned with rapid step to the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov . Raskolnikov walked straight to X -- -- Bridge , stood in the middle , and leaning both elbow on the rail stared into the distance . On parting with Razumihin , he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this place . He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street . Bending over the water , he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset , at the row of house growing dark in the gathering twilight , at one distant attic window on the left bank , flashing a though on fire in the last ray of the setting sun , at the darkening water of the canal , and the water seemed to catch his attention . At last red circle flashed before his eye , the house seemed moving , the passer-by , the canal bank , the carriage , all danced before his eye . Suddenly he started , saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight . He became aware of someone standing on the right side of him ; he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head , with a long , yellow , wasted face and red sunken eye . She wa looking straight at him , but obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one . Suddenly she leaned her right hand on the parapet , lifted her right leg over the railing , then her left and threw herself into the canal . The filthy water parted and swallowed up it victim for a moment , but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface , moving slowly with the current , her head and leg in the water , her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back . “ A woman drowning ! A woman drowning ! ” shouted dozen of voice ; people ran up , both bank were thronged with spectator , on the bridge people crowded about Raskolnikov , pressing up behind him . “ Mercy on it ! it ’ s our Afrosinya ! ” a woman cried tearfully close by . “ Mercy ! save her ! kind people , pull her out ! ” “ A boat , a boat ” wa shouted in the crowd . But there wa no need of a boat ; a policeman ran down the step to the canal , threw off his great coat and his boot and rushed into the water . It wa easy to reach her : she floated within a couple of yard from the step , he caught hold of her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him ; the drowning woman wa pulled out at once . They laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment . She soon recovered consciousness , raised her head , sat up and began sneezing and coughing , stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hand . She said nothing . “ She ’ s drunk herself out of her sens , ” the same woman ’ s voice wailed at her side . “ Out of her sens . The other day she tried to hang herself , we cut her down . I ran out to the shop just now , left my little girl to look after her -- and here she ’ s in trouble again ! A neighbour , gentleman , a neighbour , we live close by , the second house from the end , see yonder .... ” The crowd broke up . The police still remained round the woman , someone mentioned the police station .... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy . He felt disgusted . “ No , that ’ s loathsome ... water ... it ’ s not good enough , ” he muttered to himself . “ Nothing will come of it , ” he added , “ no use to wait . What about the police office ... ? And why isn ’ t Zametov at the police office ? The police office is open till ten o ’ clock .... ” He turned his back to the railing and looked about him . “ Very well then ! ” he said resolutely ; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office . His heart felt hollow and empty . He did not want to think . Even his depression had passed , there wa not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “ to make an end of it all. ” Complete apathy had succeeded to it . “ Well , it ’ s a way out of it , ” he thought , walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank . “ Anyway I ’ ll make an end , for I want to .... But is it a way out ? What doe it matter ! There ’ ll be the square yard of space -- ha ! But what an end ! Is it really the end ? Shall I tell them or not ? Ah ... damn ! How tired I am ! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon ! What I am most ashamed of is it being so stupid . But I don ’ t care about that either ! What idiotic idea come into one ’ s head. ” To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left . It wa only a few pace away . But at the first turning he stopped and , after a minute ’ s thought , turned into a side street and went two street out of his way , possibly without any object , or possibly to delay a minute and gain time . He walked , looking at the ground ; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear ; he lifted his head and saw that he wa standing at the very gate of _the_ house . He had not passed it , he had not been near it since _that_ evening . An overwhelming , unaccountable prompting drew him on . He went into the house , passed through the gateway , then into the first entrance on the right , and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey . The narrow , steep staircase wa very dark . He stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity ; on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out . “ That wasn ’ t so then , ” he thought . Here wa the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been working . “ It ’ s shut up and the door newly painted . So it ’ s to let. ” Then the third storey and the fourth . “ Here ! ” He wa perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open . There were men there , he could hear voice ; he had not expected that . After brief hesitation he mounted the last stair and went into the flat . It , too , wa being done up ; there were workman in it . This seemed to amaze him ; he somehow fancied that he would find everything a he left it , even perhaps the corps in the same place on the floor . And now , bare wall , no furniture ; it seemed strange . He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill . There were two workman , both young fellow , but one much younger than the other . They were papering the wall with a new white paper covered with lilac flower , instead of the old , dirty , yellow one . Raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this . He looked at the new paper with dislike , a though he felt sorry to have it all so changed . The workman had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home . They took no notice of Raskolnikov ’ s coming in ; they were talking . Raskolnikov folded his arm and listened . “ She come to me in the morning , ” said the elder to the younger , “ very early , all dressed up . ‘ Why are you preening and prinking ? ’ say I . ‘ I am ready to do anything to please you , Tit Vassilitch ! ’ That ’ s a way of going on ! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book ! ” “ And what is a fashion book ? ” the younger one asked . He obviously regarded the other a an authority . “ A fashion book is a lot of picture , coloured , and they come to the tailor here every Saturday , by post from abroad , to show folk how to dress , the male sex a well a the female . They ’ re picture . The gentleman are generally wearing fur coat and for the lady ’ fluffles , they ’ re beyond anything you can fancy. ” “ There ’ s nothing you can ’ t find in Petersburg , ” the younger cried enthusiastically , “ except father and mother , there ’ s everything ! ” “ Except them , there ’ s everything to be found , my boy , ” the elder declared sententiously . Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box , the bed , and the chest of drawer had been ; the room seemed to him very tiny without furniture in it . The paper wa the same ; the paper in the corner showed where the case of ikon had stood . He looked at it and went to the window . The elder workman looked at him askance . “ What do you want ? ” he asked suddenly . Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell . The same bell , the same cracked note . He rang it a second and a third time ; he listened and remembered . The hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly . He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction . “ Well , what do you want ? Who are you ? ” the workman shouted , going out to him . Raskolnikov went inside again . “ I want to take a flat , ” he said . “ I am looking round. ” “ It ’ s not the time to look at room at night ! and you ought to come up with the porter. ” “ The floor have been washed , will they be painted ? ” Raskolnikov went on . “ Is there no blood ? ” “ What blood ? ” “ Why , the old woman and her sister were murdered here . There wa a perfect pool there. ” “ But who are you ? ” the workman cried , uneasy . “ Who am I ? ” “ Yes. ” “ You want to know ? Come to the police station , I ’ ll tell you. ” The workman looked at him in amazement . “ It ’ s time for u to go , we are late . Come along , Alyoshka . We must lock up , ” said the elder workman . “ Very well , come along , ” said Raskolnikov indifferently , and going out first , he went slowly downstairs . “ Hey , porter , ” he cried in the gateway . At the entrance several people were standing , staring at the passer-by ; the two porter , a peasant woman , a man in a long coat and a few others . Raskolnikov went straight up to them . “ What do you want ? ” asked one of the porter . “ Have you been to the police office ? ” “ I ’ ve just been there . What do you want ? ” “ Is it open ? ” “ Of course. ” “ Is the assistant there ? ” “ He wa there for a time . What do you want ? ” Raskolnikov made no reply , but stood beside them lost in thought . “ He ’ s been to look at the flat , ” said the elder workman , coming forward . “ Which flat ? ” “ Where we are at work . ‘ Why have you washed away the blood ? ’ say he . ‘ There ha been a murder here , ’ say he , ‘ and I ’ ve come to take it. ’ And he began ringing at the bell , all but broke it . ‘ Come to the police station , ’ say he . ‘ I ’ ll tell you everything there. ’ He wouldn ’ t leave us. ” The porter looked at Raskolnikov , frowning and perplexed . “ Who are you ? ” he shouted a impressively a he could . “ I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov , formerly a student , I live in Shil ’ s house , not far from here , flat Number 14 , ask the porter , he know me. ” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy , dreamy voice , not turning round , but looking intently into the darkening street . “ Why have you been to the flat ? ” “ To look at it. ” “ What is there to look at ? ” “ Take him straight to the police station , ” the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly . Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the same slow , lazy tone : “ Come along. ” “ Yes , take him , ” the man went on more confidently . “ Why wa he going into _that_ , what ’ s in his mind , eh ? ” “ He ’ s not drunk , but God know what ’ s the matter with him , ” muttered the workman . “ But what do you want ? ” the porter shouted again , beginning to get angry in earnest -- “ Why are you hanging about ? ” “ You funk the police station then ? ” said Raskolnikov jeeringly . “ How funk it ? Why are you hanging about ? ” “ He ’ s a rogue ! ” shouted the peasant woman . “ Why waste time talking to him ? ” cried the other porter , a huge peasant in a full open coat and with key on his belt . “ Get along ! He is a rogue and no mistake . Get along ! ” And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street . He lurched forward , but recovered his footing , looked at the spectator in silence and walked away . “ Strange man ! ” observed the workman . “ There are strange folk about nowadays , ” said the woman . “ You should have taken him to the police station all the same , ” said the man in the long coat . “ Better have nothing to do with him , ” decided the big porter . “ A regular rogue ! Just what he want , you may be sure , but once take him up , you won ’ t get rid of him .... We know the sort ! ” “ Shall I go there or not ? ” thought Raskolnikov , standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads , and he looked about him , a though expecting from someone a decisive word . But no sound came , all wa dead and silent like the stone on which he walked , dead to him , to him alone .... All at once at the end of the street , two hundred yard away , in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shout . In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage .... A light gleamed in the middle of the street . “ What is it ? ” Raskolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd . He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he recognised it , for he had fully made up his mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over . CHAPTER VII An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horse ; there wa no one in it , and the coachman had got off his box and stood by ; the horse were being held by the bridle .... A mass of people had gathered round , the police standing in front . One of them held a lighted lantern which he wa turning on something lying close to the wheel . Everyone wa talking , shouting , exclaiming ; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating : “ What a misfortune ! Good Lord , what a misfortune ! ” Raskolnikov pushed his way in a far a he could , and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest . On the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious , and covered with blood ; he wa very badly dressed , but not like a workman . Blood wa flowing from his head and face ; his face wa crushed , mutilated and disfigured . He wa evidently badly injured . “ Merciful heaven ! ” wailed the coachman , “ what more could I do ? If I ’ d been driving fast or had not shouted to him , but I wa going quietly , not in a hurry . Everyone could see I wa going along just like everybody else . A drunken man can ’ t walk straight , we all know .... I saw him crossing the street , staggering and almost falling . I shouted again and a second and a third time , then I held the horse in , but he fell straight under their foot ! Either he did it on purpose or he wa very tipsy .... The horse are young and ready to take fright ... they started , he screamed ... that made them worse . That ’ s how it happened ! ” “ That ’ s just how it wa , ” a voice in the crowd confirmed . “ He shouted , that ’ s true , he shouted three time , ” another voice declared . “ Three time it wa , we all heard it , ” shouted a third . But the coachman wa not very much distressed and frightened . It wa evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who wa awaiting it somewhere ; the police , of course , were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangement . All they had to do wa to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital . No one knew his name . Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him . The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man ’ s face . He recognised him . “ I know him ! I know him ! ” he shouted , pushing to the front . “ It ’ s a government clerk retired from the service , Marmeladov . He life close by in Kozel ’ s house .... Make haste for a doctor ! I will pay , see ? ” He pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman . He wa in violent agitation . The police were glad that they had found out who the man wa . Raskolnikov gave his own name and address , and , a earnestly a if it had been his father , he besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at once . “ Just here , three house away , ” he said eagerly , “ the house belongs to Kozel , a rich German . He wa going home , no doubt drunk . I know him , he is a drunkard . He ha a family there , a wife , child , he ha one daughter .... It will take time to take him to the hospital , and there is sure to be a doctor in the house . I ’ ll pay , I ’ ll pay ! At least he will be looked after at home ... they will help him at once . But he ’ ll die before you get him to the hospital. ” He managed to slip something unseen into the policeman ’ s hand . But the thing wa straightforward and legitimate , and in any case help wa closer here . They raised the injured man ; people volunteered to help . Kozel ’ s house wa thirty yard away . Raskolnikov walked behind , carefully holding Marmeladov ’ s head and showing the way . “ This way , this way ! We must take him upstairs head foremost . Turn round ! I ’ ll pay , I ’ ll make it worth your while , ” he muttered . Katerina Ivanovna had just begun , a she always did at every free moment , walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again , with her arm folded across her chest , talking to herself and coughing . Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl , Polenka , a child of ten , who , though there wa much she did not understand , understood very well that her mother needed her , and so always watched her with her big clever eye and strove her utmost to appear to understand . This time Polenka wa undressing her little brother , who had been unwell all day and wa going to bed . The boy wa waiting for her to take off his shirt , which had to be washed at night . He wa sitting straight and motionless on a chair , with a silent , serious face , with his leg stretched out straight before him -- heel together and toe turned out . He wa listening to what his mother wa saying to his sister , sitting perfectly still with pouting lip and wide-open eye , just a all good little boy have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed . A little girl , still younger , dressed literally in rag , stood at the screen , waiting for her turn . The door on to the stair wa open to relieve them a little from the cloud of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other room and brought on long terrible fit of coughing in the poor , consumptive woman . Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face wa brighter than ever . “ You wouldn ’ t believe , you can ’ t imagine , Polenka , ” she said , walking about the room , “ what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa ’ s house and how this drunkard ha brought me , and will bring you all , to ruin ! Papa wa a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor ; so that everyone who came to see him said , ‘ We look upon you , Ivan Mihailovitch , a our governor ! ’ When I ... when ... ” she coughed violently , “ oh , cursed life , ” she cried , clearing her throat and pressing her hand to her breast , “ when I ... when at the last ball ... at the marshal ’ s ... Princess Bezzemelny saw me -- who gave me the blessing when your father and I were married , Polenka -- she asked at once ‘ Isn ’ t that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up ? ’ ( You must mend that tear , you must take your needle and darn it a I showed you , or to-morrow -- cough , cough , cough -- he will make the hole bigger , ” she articulated with effort . ) “ Prince Schegolskoy , a kammerjunker , had just come from Petersburg then ... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next day ; but I thanked him in flattering expression and told him that my heart had long been another ’ s . That other wa your father , Polya ; papa wa fearfully angry .... Is the water ready ? Give me the shirt , and the stocking ! Lida , ” said she to the youngest one , “ you must manage without your chemise to-night ... and lay your stocking out with it ... I ’ ll wash them together .... How is it that drunken vagabond doesn ’ t come in ? He ha worn his shirt till it look like a dish-clout , he ha torn it to rag ! I ’ d do it all together , so a not to have to work two night running ! Oh , dear ! ( Cough , cough , cough , cough ! ) Again ! What ’ s this ? ” she cried , noticing a crowd in the passage and the men , who were pushing into her room , carrying a burden . “ What is it ? What are they bringing ? Mercy on u ! ” “ Where are we to put him ? ” asked the policeman , looking round when Marmeladov , unconscious and covered with blood , had been carried in . “ On the sofa ! Put him straight on the sofa , with his head this way , ” Raskolnikov showed him . “ Run over in the road ! Drunk ! ” someone shouted in the passage . Katerina Ivanovna stood , turning white and gasping for breath . The child were terrified . Little Lida screamed , rushed to Polenka and clutched at her , trembling all over . Having laid Marmeladov down , Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna . “ For God ’ s sake be calm , don ’ t be frightened ! ” he said , speaking quickly , “ he wa crossing the road and wa run over by a carriage , don ’ t be frightened , he will come to , I told them bring him here ... I ’ ve been here already , you remember ? He will come to ; I ’ ll pay ! ” “ He ’ s done it this time ! ” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband . Raskolnikov noticed at once that she wa not one of those woman who swoon easily . She instantly placed under the luckless man ’ s head a pillow , which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him . She kept her head , forgetting herself , biting her trembling lip and stifling the scream which were ready to break from her . Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor . There wa a doctor , it appeared , next door but one . “ I ’ ve sent for a doctor , ” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna , “ don ’ t be uneasy , I ’ ll pay . Haven ’ t you water ? ... and give me a napkin or a towel , anything , a quick a you can .... He is injured , but not killed , believe me .... We shall see what the doctor say ! ” Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window ; there , on a broken chair in the corner , a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood , in readiness for washing her child ’ s and husband ’ s linen that night . This washing wa done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a week , if not oftener . For the family had come to such a pas that they were practically without change of linen , and Katerina Ivanovna could not endure uncleanliness and , rather than see dirt in the house , she preferred to wear herself out at night , working beyond her strength when the rest were asleep , so a to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning . She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov ’ s request , but almost fell down with her burden . But the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel , wetted it and began washing the blood off Marmeladov ’ s face . Katerina Ivanovna stood by , breathing painfully and pressing her hand to her breast . She wa in need of attention herself . Raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here . The policeman , too , stood in hesitation . “ Polenka , ” cried Katerina Ivanovna , “ run to Sonia , make haste . If you don ’ t find her at home , leave word that her father ha been run over and that she is to come here at once ... when she come in . Run , Polenka ! there , put on the shawl. ” “ Run your fastest ! ” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly , after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity , with round eye , his heel thrust forward and his toe spread out . Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn ’ t have dropped a pin . The policeman left , all except one , who remained for a time , trying to drive out the people who came in from the stair . Almost all Madame Lippevechsel ’ s lodger had streamed in from the inner room of the flat ; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway , but afterwards they overflowed into the room . Katerina Ivanovna flew into a fury . “ You might let him die in peace , at least , ” she shouted at the crowd , “ is it a spectacle for you to gape at ? With cigarette ! ( Cough , cough , cough ! ) You might a well keep your hat on .... And there is one in his hat ! ... Get away ! You should respect the dead , at least ! ” Her cough choked her -- but her reproach were not without result . They evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna . The lodger , one after another , squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident , even in those nearest and dearest to the victim , from which no living man is exempt , even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion . Voices outside were heard , however , speaking of the hospital and saying that they ’ d no business to make a disturbance here . “ No business to die ! ” cried Katerina Ivanovna , and she wa rushing to the door to vent her wrath upon them , but in the doorway came face to face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order . She wa a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible German . “ Ah , my God ! ” she cried , clasping her hand , “ your husband drunken horse have trampled ! To the hospital with him ! I am the landlady ! ” “ Amalia Ludwigovna , I beg you to recollect what you are saying , ” Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily ( she always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might “ remember her place ” and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction ) . “ Amalia Ludwigovna ... ” “ I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may not dare ; I am Amalia Ivanovna. ” “ You are not Amalia Ivanovna , but Amalia Ludwigovna , and a I am not one of your despicable flatterer like Mr. Lebeziatnikov , who ’ s laughing behind the door at this moment ( a laugh and a cry of ‘ they are at it again ’ wa in fact audible at the door ) so I shall always call you Amalia Ludwigovna , though I fail to understand why you dislike that name . You can see for yourself what ha happened to Semyon Zaharovitch ; he is dying . I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one . Let him at least die in peace ! Or I warn you the Governor-General , himself , shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow . The prince knew me a a girl ; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and ha often been a benefactor to him . Everyone know that Semyon Zaharovitch had many friend and protector , whom he abandoned himself from an honourable pride , knowing his unhappy weakness , but now ( she pointed to Raskolnikov ) a generous young man ha come to our assistance , who ha wealth and connection and whom Semyon Zaharovitch ha known from a child . You may rest assured , Amalia Ludwigovna ... ” All this wa uttered with extreme rapidity , getting quicker and quicker , but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna ’ s eloquence . At that instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan ; she ran to him . The injured man opened his eye and without recognition or understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who wa bending over him . He drew deep , slow , painful breath ; blood oozed at the corner of his mouth and drop of perspiration came out on his forehead . Not recognising Raskolnikov , he began looking round uneasily . Katerina Ivanovna looked at him with a sad but stern face , and tear trickled from her eye . “ My God ! His whole chest is crushed ! How he is bleeding , ” she said in despair . “ We must take off his clothes . Turn a little , Semyon Zaharovitch , if you can , ” she cried to him . Marmeladov recognised her . “ A priest , ” he articulated huskily . Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window , laid her head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair : “ Oh , cursed life ! ” “ A priest , ” the dying man said again after a moment ’ s silence . “ They ’ ve gone for him , ” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him , he obeyed her shout and wa silent . With sad and timid eye he looked for her ; she returned and stood by his pillow . He seemed a little easier but not for long . Soon his eye rested on little Lida , his favourite , who wa shaking in the corner , a though she were in a fit , and staring at him with her wondering childish eye . “ A-ah , ” he signed towards her uneasily . He wanted to say something . “ What now ? ” cried Katerina Ivanovna . “ Barefoot , barefoot ! ” he muttered , indicating with frenzied eye the child ’ s bare foot . “ Be silent , ” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably , “ you know why she is barefooted. ” “ Thank God , the doctor , ” exclaimed Raskolnikov , relieved . The doctor came in , a precise little old man , a German , looking about him mistrustfully ; he went up to the sick man , took his pulse , carefully felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the blood-stained shirt , and bared the injured man ’ s chest . It wa gashed , crushed and fractured , several rib on the right side were broken . On the left side , just over the heart , wa a large , sinister-looking yellowish-black bruise -- a cruel kick from the horse ’ s hoof . The doctor frowned . The policeman told him that he wa caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yard on the road . “ It ’ s wonderful that he ha recovered consciousness , ” the doctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov . “ What do you think of him ? ” he asked . “ He will die immediately. ” “ Is there really no hope ? ” “ Not the faintest ! He is at the last gasp .... His head is badly injured , too ... Hm ... I could bleed him if you like , but ... it would be useless . He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes. ” “ Better bleed him then. ” “ If you like .... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless. ” At that moment other step were heard ; the crowd in the passage parted , and the priest , a little , grey old man , appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament . A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident . The doctor changed place with him , exchanging glance with him . Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while . He shrugged his shoulder and remained . All stepped back . The confession wa soon over . The dying man probably understood little ; he could only utter indistinct broken sound . Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida , lifted the boy from the chair , knelt down in the corner by the stove and made the child kneel in front of her . The little girl wa still trembling ; but the boy , kneeling on his little bare knee , lifted his hand rhythmically , crossing himself with precision and bowed down , touching the floor with his forehead , which seemed to afford him especial satisfaction . Katerina Ivanovna bit her lip and held back her tear ; she prayed , too , now and then pulling straight the boy ’ s shirt , and managed to cover the girl ’ s bare shoulder with a kerchief , which she took from the chest without rising from her knee or ceasing to pray . Meanwhile the door from the inner room wa opened inquisitively again . In the passage the crowd of spectator from all the flat on the staircase grew denser and denser , but they did not venture beyond the threshold . A single candle-end lighted up the scene . At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door . She came in panting from running so fast , took off her kerchief , looked for her mother , went up to her and said , “ She ’ s coming , I met her in the street. ” Her mother made her kneel beside her . Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd , and strange wa her appearance in that room , in the midst of want , rag , death and despair . She , too , wa in rag , her attire wa all of the cheapest , but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp , unmistakably betraying it shameful purpose . Sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered , unconscious of everything . She forgot her fourth-hand , gaudy silk dress , so unseemly here with it ridiculous long train , and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway , and her light-coloured shoe , and the parasol she brought with her , though it wa no use at night , and the absurd round straw hat with it flaring flame-coloured feather . Under this rakishly-tilted hat wa a pale , frightened little face with lip parted and eye staring in terror . Sonia wa a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair , rather pretty , with wonderful blue eye . She looked intently at the bed and the priest ; she too wa out of breath with running . At last whisper , some word in the crowd probably , reached her . She looked down and took a step forward into the room , still keeping close to the door . The service wa over . Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again . The priest stepped back and turned to say a few word of admonition and consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving . “ What am I to do with these ? ” she interrupted sharply and irritably , pointing to the little one . “ God is merciful ; look to the Most High for succour , ” the priest began . “ Ach ! He is merciful , but not to us. ” “ That ’ s a sin , a sin , madam , ” observed the priest , shaking his head . “ And isn ’ t that a sin ? ” cried Katerina Ivanovna , pointing to the dying man . “ Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you , at least for the loss of his earnings. ” “ You don ’ t understand ! ” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand . “ And why should they compensate me ? Why , he wa drunk and threw himself under the horse ! What earnings ? He brought u in nothing but misery . He drank everything away , the drunkard ! He robbed u to get drink , he wasted their life and mine for drink ! And thank God he ’ s dying ! One le to keep ! ” “ You must forgive in the hour of death , that ’ s a sin , madam , such feeling are a great sin. ” Katerina Ivanovna wa busy with the dying man ; she wa giving him water , wiping the blood and sweat from his head , setting his pillow straight , and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest . Now she flew at him almost in a frenzy . “ Ah , father ! That ’ s word and only word ! Forgive ! If he ’ d not been run over , he ’ d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rag and he ’ d have fallen asleep like a log , and I should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak , washing his rag and the child ’ s and then drying them by the window and a soon a it wa daylight I should have been darning them . That ’ s how I spend my night ! ... What ’ s the use of talking of forgiveness ! I have forgiven a it is ! ” A terrible hollow cough interrupted her word . She put her handkerchief to her lip and showed it to the priest , pressing her other hand to her aching chest . The handkerchief wa covered with blood . The priest bowed his head and said nothing . Marmeladov wa in the last agony ; he did not take his eye off the face of Katerina Ivanovna , who wa bending over him again . He kept trying to say something to her ; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly , but Katerina Ivanovna , understanding that he wanted to ask her forgiveness , called peremptorily to him : “ Be silent ! No need ! I know what you want to say ! ” And the sick man wa silent , but at the same instant his wandering eye strayed to the doorway and he saw Sonia . Till then he had not noticed her : she wa standing in the shadow in a corner . “ Who ’ s that ? Who ’ s that ? ” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice , in agitation , turning his eye in horror towards the door where his daughter wa standing , and trying to sit up . “ Lie down ! Lie do-own ! ” cried Katerina Ivanovna . With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his elbow . He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter , a though not recognising her . He had never seen her before in such attire . Suddenly he recognised her , crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy finery , meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying father . His face showed intense suffering . “ Sonia ! Daughter ! Forgive ! ” he cried , and he tried to hold out his hand to her , but losing his balance , he fell off the sofa , face downwards on the floor . They rushed to pick him up , they put him on the sofa ; but he wa dying . Sonia with a faint cry ran up , embraced him and remained so without moving . He died in her arm . “ He ’ s got what he wanted , ” Katerina Ivanovna cried , seeing her husband ’ s dead body . “ Well , what ’ s to be done now ? How am I to bury him ! What can I give them to-morrow to eat ? ” Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna . “ Katerina Ivanovna , ” he began , “ last week your husband told me all his life and circumstance .... Believe me , he spoke of you with passionate reverence . From that evening , when I learnt how devoted he wa to you all and how he loved and respected you especially , Katerina Ivanovna , in spite of his unfortunate weakness , from that evening we became friend .... Allow me now ... to do something ... to repay my debt to my dead friend . Here are twenty rouble , I think -- and if that can be of any assistance to you , then ... I ... in short , I will come again , I will be sure to come again ... I shall , perhaps , come again to-morrow .... Good-bye ! ” And he went quickly out of the room , squeezing his way through the crowd to the stair . But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim Fomitch , who had heard of the accident and had come to give instruction in person . They had not met since the scene at the police station , but Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly . “ Ah , is that you ? ” he asked him . “ He ’ s dead , ” answered Raskolnikov . “ The doctor and the priest have been , all a it should have been . Don ’ t worry the poor woman too much , she is in consumption a it is . Try and cheer her up , if possible ... you are a kind-hearted man , I know ... ” he added with a smile , looking straight in his face . “ But you are spattered with blood , ” observed Nikodim Fomitch , noticing in the lamplight some fresh stain on Raskolnikov ’ s waistcoat . “ Yes ... I ’ m covered with blood , ” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air ; then he smiled , nodded and went downstairs . He walked down slowly and deliberately , feverish but not conscious of it , entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him . This sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who ha suddenly been pardoned . Halfway down the staircase he wa overtaken by the priest on his way home ; Raskolnikov let him pas , exchanging a silent greeting with him . He wa just descending the last step when he heard rapid footstep behind him . Someone overtook him ; it wa Polenka . She wa running after him , calling “ Wait ! wait ! ” He turned round . She wa at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him . A dim light came in from the yard . Raskolnikov could distinguish the child ’ s thin but pretty little face , looking at him with a bright childish smile . She had run after him with a message which she wa evidently glad to give . “ Tell me , what is your name ? ... and where do you live ? ” she said hurriedly in a breathless voice . He laid both hand on her shoulder and looked at her with a sort of rapture . It wa such a joy to him to look at her , he could not have said why . “ Who sent you ? ” “ Sister Sonia sent me , ” answered the girl , smiling still more brightly . “ I knew it wa sister Sonia sent you. ” “ Mamma sent me , too ... when sister Sonia wa sending me , mamma came up , too , and said ‘ Run fast , Polenka. ’ ” “ Do you love sister Sonia ? ” “ I love her more than anyone , ” Polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness , and her smile became graver . “ And will you love me ? ” By way of answer he saw the little girl ’ s face approaching him , her full lip naïvely held out to kiss him . Suddenly her arm a thin a stick held him tightly , her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly , pressing her face against him . “ I am sorry for father , ” she said a moment later , raising her tear-stained face and brushing away the tear with her hand . “ It ’ s nothing but misfortune now , ” she added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which child try hard to assume when they want to speak like grown-up people . “ Did your father love you ? ” “ He loved Lida most , ” she went on very seriously without a smile , exactly like grown-up people , “ he loved her because she is little and because she is ill , too . And he always used to bring her present . But he taught u to read and me grammar and scripture , too , ” she added with dignity . “ And mother never used to say anything , but we knew that she liked it and father knew it , too . And mother want to teach me French , for it ’ s time my education began. ” “ And do you know your prayer ? ” “ Of course , we do ! We knew them long ago . I say my prayer to myself a I am a big girl now , but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother . First they repeat the ‘ Ave Maria ’ and then another prayer : ‘ Lord , forgive and bless sister Sonia , ’ and then another , ‘ Lord , forgive and bless our second father. ’ For our elder father is dead and this is another one , but we do pray for the other a well. ” “ Polenka , my name is Rodion . Pray sometimes for me , too . ‘ And Thy servant Rodion , ’ nothing more. ” “ I ’ ll pray for you all the rest of my life , ” the little girl declared hotly , and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him warmly once more . Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to come next day . The child went away quite enchanted with him . It wa past ten when he came out into the street . In five minute he wa standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in . “ Enough , ” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly . “ I ’ ve done with fancy , imaginary terror and phantom ! Life is real ! haven ’ t I lived just now ? My life ha not yet died with that old woman ! The Kingdom of Heaven to her -- and now enough , madam , leave me in peace ! Now for the reign of reason and light ... and of will , and of strength ... and now we will see ! We will try our strength ! ” he added defiantly , a though challenging some power of darkness . “ And I wa ready to consent to live in a square of space ! “ I am very weak at this moment , but ... I believe my illness is all over . I knew it would be over when I went out . By the way , Potchinkov ’ s house is only a few step away . I certainly must go to Razumihin even if it were not close by ... let him win his bet ! Let u give him some satisfaction , too -- no matter ! Strength , strength is what one want , you can get nothing without it , and strength must be won by strength -- that ’ s what they don ’ t know , ” he added proudly and self-confidently and he walked with flagging footstep from the bridge . Pride and self-confidence grew continually stronger in him ; he wa becoming a different man every moment . What wa it had happened to work this revolution in him ? He did not know himself ; like a man catching at a straw , he suddenly felt that he , too , ‘ could live , that there wa still life for him , that his life had not died with the old woman. ’ Perhaps he wa in too great a hurry with his conclusion , but he did not think of that . “ But I did ask her to remember ‘ Thy servant Rodion ’ in her prayer , ” the idea struck him . “ Well , that wa ... in case of emergency , ” he added and laughed himself at his boyish sally . He wa in the best of spirit . He easily found Razumihin ; the new lodger wa already known at Potchinkov ’ s and the porter at once showed him the way . Half-way upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people . The door wa wide open on the stair ; he could hear exclamation and discussion . Razumihin ’ s room wa fairly large ; the company consisted of fifteen people . Raskolnikov stopped in the entry , where two of the landlady ’ s servant were busy behind a screen with two samovar , bottle , plate and dish of pie and savoury , brought up from the landlady ’ s kitchen . Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin . He ran out delighted . At the first glance it wa apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and , though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite drunk , this time he wa perceptibly affected by it . “ Listen , ” Raskolnikov hastened to say , “ I ’ ve only just come to tell you you ’ ve won your bet and that no one really know what may not happen to him . I can ’ t come in ; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly . And so good evening and good-bye ! Come and see me to-morrow. ” “ Do you know what ? I ’ ll see you home . If you say you ’ re weak yourself , you must ... ” “ And your visitor ? Who is the curly-headed one who ha just peeped out ? ” “ He ? Goodness only know ! Some friend of uncle ’ s , I expect , or perhaps he ha come without being invited ... I ’ ll leave uncle with them , he is an invaluable person , pity I can ’ t introduce you to him now . But confound them all now ! They won ’ t notice me , and I need a little fresh air , for you ’ ve come just in the nick of time -- another two minute and I should have come to blow ! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff ... you simply can ’ t imagine what men will say ! Though why shouldn ’ t you imagine ? Don ’ t we talk nonsense ourselves ? And let them ... that ’ s the way to learn not to ! ... Wait a minute , I ’ ll fetch Zossimov. ” Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily ; he showed a special interest in him ; soon his face brightened . “ You must go to bed at once , ” he pronounced , examining the patient a far a he could , “ and take something for the night . Will you take it ? I got it ready some time ago ... a powder. ” “ Two , if you like , ” answered Raskolnikov . The powder wa taken at once . “ It ’ s a good thing you are taking him home , ” observed Zossimov to Razumihin -- “ we shall see how he is to-morrow , to-day he ’ s not at all amiss -- a considerable change since the afternoon . Live and learn ... ” “ Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out ? ” Razumihin blurted out , a soon a they were in the street . “ I won ’ t tell you everything , brother , because they are such fool . Zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me , and afterwards I am to tell him about it , for he ’ s got a notion in his head that you are ... mad or close on it . Only fancy ! In the first place , you ’ ve three time the brain he ha ; in the second , if you are not mad , you needn ’ t care a hang that he ha got such a wild idea ; and thirdly , that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery ha gone mad on mental disease , and what ’ s brought him to this conclusion about you wa your conversation to-day with Zametov. ” “ Zametov told you all about it ? ” “ Yes , and he did well . Now I understand what it all mean and so doe Zametov .... Well , the fact is , Rodya ... the point is ... I am a little drunk now .... But that ’ s ... no matter ... the point is that this idea ... you understand ? wa just being hatched in their brain ... you understand ? That is , no one ventured to say it aloud , because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter , that bubble ’ s burst and gone for ever . But why are they such fool ? I gave Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time -- that ’ s between ourselves , brother ; please don ’ t let out a hint that you know of it ; I ’ ve noticed he is a ticklish subject ; it wa at Luise Ivanovna ’ s . But to-day , to-day it ’ s all cleared up . That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it ! He took advantage of your fainting at the police station , but he is ashamed of it himself now ; I know that ... ” Raskolnikov listened greedily . Razumihin wa drunk enough to talk too freely . “ I fainted then because it wa so close and the smell of paint , ” said Raskolnikov . “ No need to explain that ! And it wasn ’ t the paint only : the fever had been coming on for a month ; Zossimov testifies to that ! But how crushed that boy is now , you wouldn ’ t believe ! ‘ I am not worth his little finger , ’ he say . Yours , he mean . He ha good feeling at time , brother . But the lesson , the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais de Cristal , that wa too good for anything ! You frightened him at first , you know , he nearly went into convulsion ! You almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense , and then you suddenly -- put out your tongue at him : ‘ There now , what do you make of it ? ’ It wa perfect ! He is crushed , annihilated now ! It wa masterly , by Jove , it ’ s what they deserve ! Ah , that I wasn ’ t there ! He wa hoping to see you awfully . Porfiry , too , want to make your acquaintance ... ” “ Ah ! ... he too ... but why did they put me down a mad ? ” “ Oh , not mad . I must have said too much , brother .... What struck him , you see , wa that only that subject seemed to interest you ; now it ’ s clear why it did interest you ; knowing all the circumstance ... and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness ... I am a little drunk , brother , only , confound him , he ha some idea of his own ... I tell you , he ’ s mad on mental disease . But don ’ t you mind him ... ” For half a minute both were silent . “ Listen , Razumihin , ” began Raskolnikov , “ I want to tell you plainly : I ’ ve just been at a death-bed , a clerk who died ... I gave them all my money ... and besides I ’ ve just been kissed by someone who , if I had killed anyone , would just the same ... in fact I saw someone else there ... with a flame-coloured feather ... but I am talking nonsense ; I am very weak , support me ... we shall be at the stair directly ... ” “ What ’ s the matter ? What ’ s the matter with you ? ” Razumihin asked anxiously . “ I am a little giddy , but that ’ s not the point , I am so sad , so sad ... like a woman . Look , what ’ s that ? Look , look ! ” “ What is it ? ” “ Don ’ t you see ? A light in my room , you see ? Through the crack ... ” They were already at the foot of the last flight of stair , at the level of the landlady ’ s door , and they could , a a fact , see from below that there wa a light in Raskolnikov ’ s garret . “ Queer ! Nastasya , perhaps , ” observed Razumihin . “ She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago , but ... I don ’ t care ! Good-bye ! ” “ What do you mean ? I am coming with you , we ’ ll come in together ! ” “ I know we are going in together , but I want to shake hand here and say good-bye to you here . So give me your hand , good-bye ! ” “ What ’ s the matter with you , Rodya ? ” “ Nothing ... come along ... you shall be witness. ” They began mounting the stair , and the idea struck Razumihin that perhaps Zossimov might be right after all . “ Ah , I ’ ve upset him with my chatter ! ” he muttered to himself . When they reached the door they heard voice in the room . “ What is it ? ” cried Razumihin . Raskolnikov wa the first to open the door ; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway , dumbfoundered . His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him . Why had he never expected , never thought of them , though the news that they had started , were on their way and would arrive immediately , had been repeated to him only that day ? They had spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with question . She wa standing before them and had told them everything by now . They were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “ running away ” to-day , ill and , a they understood from her story , delirious ! “ Good Heavens , what had become of him ? ” Both had been weeping , both had been in anguish for that hour and a half . A cry of joy , of ecstasy , greeted Raskolnikov ’ s entrance . Both rushed to him . But he stood like one dead ; a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt . He did not lift his arm to embrace them , he could not . His mother and sister clasped him in their arm , kissed him , laughed and cried . He took a step , tottered and fell to the ground , fainting . Anxiety , cry of horror , moan ... Razumihin who wa standing in the doorway flew into the room , seized the sick man in his strong arm and in a moment had him on the sofa . “ It ’ s nothing , nothing ! ” he cried to the mother and sister -- “ it ’ s only a faint , a mere trifle ! Only just now the doctor said he wa much better , that he is perfectly well ! Water ! See , he is coming to himself , he is all right again ! ” And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it , he made her bend down to see that “ he is all right again. ” The mother and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude , a their Providence . They had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya during his illness , by this “ very competent young man , ” a Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with Dounia . PART III CHAPTER I Raskolnikov got up , and sat down on the sofa . He waved his hand weakly to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolation he wa addressing to his mother and sister , took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking . His mother wa alarmed by his expression . It revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant , and at the same time something immovable , almost insane . Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry . Avdotya Romanovna wa pale ; her hand trembled in her brother ’ s . “ Go home ... with him , ” he said in a broken voice , pointing to Razumihin , “ good-bye till to-morrow ; to-morrow everything ... Is it long since you arrived ? ” “ This evening , Rodya , ” answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna , “ the train wa awfully late . But , Rodya , nothing would induce me to leave you now ! I will spend the night here , near you ... ” “ Don ’ t torture me ! ” he said with a gesture of irritation . “ I will stay with him , ” cried Razumihin , “ I won ’ t leave him for a moment . Bother all my visitor ! Let them rage to their heart ’ content ! My uncle is presiding there. ” “ How , how can I thank you ! ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa beginning , once more pressing Razumihin ’ s hand , but Raskolnikov interrupted her again . “ I can ’ t have it ! I can ’ t have it ! ” he repeated irritably , “ don ’ t worry me ! Enough , go away ... I can ’ t stand it ! ” “ Come , mamma , come out of the room at least for a minute , ” Dounia whispered in dismay ; “ we are distressing him , that ’ s evident. ” “ Mayn ’ t I look at him after three year ? ” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Stay , ” he stopped them again , “ you keep interrupting me , and my idea get muddled .... Have you seen Luzhin ? ” “ No , Rodya , but he know already of our arrival . We have heard , Rodya , that Pyotr Petrovitch wa so kind a to visit you today , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly . “ Yes ... he wa so kind ... Dounia , I promised Luzhin I ’ d throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell .... ” “ Rodya , what are you saying ! Surely , you don ’ t mean to tell u ... ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm , but she stopped , looking at Dounia . Avdotya Romanovna wa looking attentively at her brother , waiting for what would come next . Both of them had heard of the quarrel from Nastasya , so far a she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it , and were in painful perplexity and suspense . “ Dounia , ” Raskolnikov continued with an effort , “ I don ’ t want that marriage , so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin , so that we may never hear his name again. ” “ Good Heavens ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Brother , think what you are saying ! ” Avdotya Romanovna began impetuously , but immediately checked herself . “ You are not fit to talk now , perhaps ; you are tired , ” she added gently . “ You think I am delirious ? No ... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_ sake . But I won ’ t accept the sacrifice . And so write a letter before to-morrow , to refuse him ... Let me read it in the morning and that will be the end of it ! ” “ That I can ’ t do ! ” the girl cried , offended , “ what right have you ... ” “ Dounia , you are hasty , too , be quiet , to-morrow ... Don ’ t you see ... ” the mother interposed in dismay . “ Better come away ! ” “ He is raving , ” Razumihin cried tipsily , “ or how would he dare ! To-morrow all this nonsense will be over ... to-day he certainly did drive him away . That wa so . And Luzhin got angry , too .... He made speech here , wanted to show off his learning and he went out crest-fallen .... ” “ Then it ’ s true ? ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Good-bye till to-morrow , brother , ” said Dounia compassionately -- “ let u go , mother ... Good-bye , Rodya. ” “ Do you hear , sister , ” he repeated after them , making a last effort , “ I am not delirious ; this marriage is -- an infamy . Let me act like a scoundrel , but you mustn ’ t ... one is enough ... and though I am a scoundrel , I wouldn ’ t own such a sister . It ’ s me or Luzhin ! Go now .... ” “ But you ’ re out of your mind ! Despot ! ” roared Razumihin ; but Raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer . He lay down on the sofa , and turned to the wall , utterly exhausted . Avdotya Romanovna looked with interest at Razumihin ; her black eye flashed ; Razumihin positively started at her glance . Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed . “ Nothing would induce me to go , ” she whispered in despair to Razumihin . “ I will stay somewhere here ... escort Dounia home. ” “ You ’ ll spoil everything , ” Razumihin answered in the same whisper , losing patience -- “ come out on to the stair , anyway . Nastasya , show a light ! I assure you , ” he went on in a half whisper on the stair -- “ that he wa almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon ! Do you understand ? The doctor himself ! Even he gave way and left him , so a not to irritate him . I remained downstairs on guard , but he dressed at once and slipped off . And he will slip off again if you irritate him , at this time of night , and will do himself some mischief .... ” “ What are you saying ? ” “ And Avdotya Romanovna can ’ t possibly be left in those lodging without you . Just think where you are staying ! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch couldn ’ t find you better lodging ... But you know I ’ ve had a little to drink , and that ’ s what make me ... swear ; don ’ t mind it .... ” “ But I ’ ll go to the landlady here , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted , “ I ’ ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night . I can ’ t leave him like that , I can not ! ” This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady ’ s door . Nastasya lighted them from a step below . Razumihin wa in extraordinary excitement . Half an hour earlier , while he wa bringing Raskolnikov home , he had indeed talked too freely , but he wa aware of it himself , and his head wa clear in spite of the vast quantity he had imbibed . Now he wa in a state bordering on ecstasy , and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect . He stood with the two lady , seizing both by their hand , persuading them , and giving them reason with astonishing plainness of speech , and at almost every word he uttered , probably to emphasise his argument , he squeezed their hand painfully a in a vise . He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the least regard for good manner . They sometimes pulled their hand out of his huge bony paw , but far from noticing what wa the matter , he drew them all the closer to him . If they ’ d told him to jump head foremost from the staircase , he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service . Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man wa really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much , in her anxiety over her Rodya she looked on his presence a providential , and wa unwilling to notice all his peculiarity . But though Avdotya Romanovna shared her anxiety , and wa not of timorous disposition , she could not see the glowing light in his eye without wonder and almost alarm . It wa only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya ’ s account of her brother ’ s queer friend , which prevented her from trying to run away from him , and to persuade her mother to do the same . She realised , too , that even running away wa perhaps impossible now . Ten minute later , however , she wa considerably reassured ; it wa characteristic of Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once , whatever mood he might be in , so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with . “ You can ’ t go to the landlady , that ’ s perfect nonsense ! ” he cried . “ If you stay , though you are his mother , you ’ ll drive him to a frenzy , and then goodness know what will happen ! Listen , I ’ ll tell you what I ’ ll do : Nastasya will stay with him now , and I ’ ll conduct you both home , you can ’ t be in the street alone ; Petersburg is an awful place in that way .... But no matter ! Then I ’ ll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later , on my word of honour , I ’ ll bring you news how he is , whether he is asleep , and all that . Then , listen ! Then I ’ ll run home in a twinkling -- I ’ ve a lot of friend there , all drunk -- I ’ ll fetch Zossimov -- that ’ s the doctor who is looking after him , he is there , too , but he is not drunk ; he is not drunk , he is never drunk ! I ’ ll drag him to Rodya , and then to you , so that you ’ ll get two report in the hour -- from the doctor , you understand , from the doctor himself , that ’ s a very different thing from my account of him ! If there ’ s anything wrong , I swear I ’ ll bring you here myself , but , if it ’ s all right , you go to bed . And I ’ ll spend the night here , in the passage , he won ’ t hear me , and I ’ ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady ’ s , to be at hand . Which is better for him : you or the doctor ? So come home then ! But the landlady is out of the question ; it ’ s all right for me , but it ’ s out of the question for you : she wouldn ’ t take you , for she ’ s ... for she ’ s a fool ... She ’ d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you , too , if you want to know ... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly . She is an absolutely , absolutely unaccountable character ! But I am a fool , too ! ... No matter ! Come along ! Do you trust me ? Come , do you trust me or not ? ” “ Let u go , mother , ” said Avdotya Romanovna , “ he will certainly do what he ha promised . He ha saved Rodya already , and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here , what could be better ? ” “ You see , you ... you ... understand me , because you are an angel ! ” Razumihin cried in ecstasy , “ let u go ! Nastasya ! Fly upstairs and sit with him with a light ; I ’ ll come in a quarter of an hour. ” Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa not perfectly convinced , she made no further resistance . Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stair . He still made her uneasy , a though he wa competent and good-natured , wa he capable of carrying out his promise ? He seemed in such a condition .... “ Ah , I see you think I am in such a condition ! ” Razumihin broke in upon her thought , guessing them , a he strolled along the pavement with huge step , so that the two lady could hardly keep up with him , a fact he did not observe , however . “ Nonsense ! That is ... I am drunk like a fool , but that ’ s not it ; I am not drunk from wine . It ’ s seeing you ha turned my head ... But don ’ t mind me ! Don ’ t take any notice : I am talking nonsense , I am not worthy of you .... I am utterly unworthy of you ! The minute I ’ ve taken you home , I ’ ll pour a couple of pailful of water over my head in the gutter here , and then I shall be all right .... If only you knew how I love you both ! Don ’ t laugh , and don ’ t be angry ! You may be angry with anyone , but not with me ! I am his friend , and therefore I am your friend , too , I want to be ... I had a presentiment ... Last year there wa a moment ... though it wasn ’ t a presentiment really , for you seem to have fallen from heaven . And I expect I shan ’ t sleep all night ... Zossimov wa afraid a little time ago that he would go mad ... that ’ s why he mustn ’ t be irritated. ” “ What do you say ? ” cried the mother . “ Did the doctor really say that ? ” asked Avdotya Romanovna , alarmed . “ Yes , but it ’ s not so , not a bit of it . He gave him some medicine , a powder , I saw it , and then your coming here .... Ah ! It would have been better if you had come to-morrow . It ’ s a good thing we went away . And in an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything . He is not drunk ! And I shan ’ t be drunk .... And what made me get so tight ? Because they got me into an argument , damn them ! I ’ ve sworn never to argue ! They talk such trash ! I almost came to blow ! I ’ ve left my uncle to preside . Would you believe , they insist on complete absence of individualism and that ’ s just what they relish ! Not to be themselves , to be a unlike themselves a they can . That ’ s what they regard a the highest point of progress . If only their nonsense were their own , but a it is ... ” “ Listen ! ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly , but it only added fuel to the flame . “ What do you think ? ” shouted Razumihin , louder than ever , “ you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense ? Not a bit ! I like them to talk nonsense . That ’ s man ’ s one privilege over all creation . Through error you come to the truth ! I am a man because I err ! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistake and very likely a hundred and fourteen . And a fine thing , too , in it way ; but we can ’ t even make mistake on our own account ! Talk nonsense , but talk your own nonsense , and I ’ ll kiss you for it . To go wrong in one ’ s own way is better than to go right in someone else ’ s . In the first case you are a man , in the second you ’ re no better than a bird . Truth won ’ t escape you , but life can be cramped . There have been example . And what are we doing now ? In science , development , thought , invention , ideal , aim , liberalism , judgment , experience and everything , everything , everything , we are still in the preparatory class at school . We prefer to live on other people ’ s idea , it ’ s what we are used to ! Am I right , am I right ? ” cried Razumihin , pressing and shaking the two lady ’ hand . “ Oh , mercy , I do not know , ” cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Yes , yes ... though I don ’ t agree with you in everything , ” added Avdotya Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry , for he squeezed her hand so painfully . “ Yes , you say yes ... well after that you ... you ... ” he cried in a transport , “ you are a fount of goodness , purity , sense ... and perfection . Give me your hand ... you give me yours , too ! I want to kiss your hand here at once , on my knee ... ” and he fell on his knee on the pavement , fortunately at that time deserted . “ Leave off , I entreat you , what are you doing ? ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried , greatly distressed . “ Get up , get up ! ” said Dounia laughing , though she , too , wa upset . “ Not for anything till you let me kiss your hand ! That ’ s it ! Enough ! I get up and we ’ ll go on ! I am a luckless fool , I am unworthy of you and drunk ... and I am ashamed .... I am not worthy to love you , but to do homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast ! And I ’ ve done homage .... Here are your lodging , and for that alone Rodya wa right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away .... How dare he ! how dare he put you in such lodging ! It ’ s a scandal ! Do you know the sort of people they take in here ? And you his betrothed ! You are his betrothed ? Yes ? Well , then , I ’ ll tell you , your _fiancé_ is a scoundrel. ” “ Excuse me , Mr. Razumihin , you are forgetting ... ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa beginning . “ Yes , yes , you are right , I did forget myself , I am ashamed of it , ” Razumihin made haste to apologise . “ But ... but you can ’ t be angry with me for speaking so ! For I speak sincerely and not because ... hm , hm ! That would be disgraceful ; in fact not because I ’ m in ... hm ! Well , anyway , I won ’ t say why , I daren ’ t .... But we all saw to-day when he came in that that man is not of our sort . Not because he had his hair curled at the barber ’ s , not because he wa in such a hurry to show his wit , but because he is a spy , a speculator , because he is a skin-flint and a buffoon . That ’ s evident . Do you think him clever ? No , he is a fool , a fool . And is he a match for you ? Good heaven ! Do you see , lady ? ” he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their room , “ though all my friend there are drunk , yet they are all honest , and though we do talk a lot of trash , and I do , too , yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last , for we are on the right path , while Pyotr Petrovitch ... is not on the right path . Though I ’ ve been calling them all sort of name just now , I do respect them all ... though I don ’ t respect Zametov , I like him , for he is a puppy , and that bullock Zossimov , because he is an honest man and know his work . But enough , it ’ s all said and forgiven . Is it forgiven ? Well , then , let ’ s go on . I know this corridor , I ’ ve been here , there wa a scandal here at Number 3 .... Where are you here ? Which number ? eight ? Well , lock yourselves in for the night , then . Don ’ t let anybody in . In a quarter of an hour I ’ ll come back with news , and half an hour later I ’ ll bring Zossimov , you ’ ll see ! Good-bye , I ’ ll run. ” “ Good heaven , Dounia , what is going to happen ? ” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna , addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay . “ Don ’ t worry yourself , mother , ” said Dounia , taking off her hat and cape . “ God ha sent this gentleman to our aid , though he ha come from a drinking party . We can depend on him , I assure you . And all that he ha done for Rodya .... ” “ Ah . Dounia , goodness know whether he will come ! How could I bring myself to leave Rodya ? ... And how different , how different I had fancied our meeting ! How sullen he wa , a though not pleased to see u .... ” Tears came into her eye . “ No , it ’ s not that , mother . You didn ’ t see , you were cry all the time . He is quite unhinged by serious illness -- that ’ s the reason. ” “ Ah , that illness ! What will happen , what will happen ? And how he talked to you , Dounia ! ” said the mother , looking timidly at her daughter , trying to read her thought and , already half consoled by Dounia ’ s standing up for her brother , which meant that she had already forgiven him . “ I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow , ” she added , probing her further . “ And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow ... about that , ” Avdotya Romanovna said finally . And , of course , there wa no going beyond that , for this wa a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa afraid to discus . Dounia went up and kissed her mother . The latter warmly embraced her without speaking . Then she sat down to wait anxiously for Razumihin ’ s return , timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arm folded , lost in thought . This walking up and down when she wa thinking wa a habit of Avdotya Romanovna ’ s and the mother wa always afraid to break in on her daughter ’ s mood at such moment . Razumihin , of course , wa ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation for Avdotya Romanovna . Yet apart from his eccentric condition , many people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya Romanovna , especially at that moment when she wa walking to and fro with folded arm , pensive and melancholy . Avdotya Romanovna wa remarkably good-looking ; she wa tall , strikingly well-proportioned , strong and self-reliant -- the latter quality wa apparent in every gesture , though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movement . In face she resembled her brother , but she might be described a really beautiful . Her hair wa dark brown , a little lighter than her brother ’ s ; there wa a proud light in her almost black eye and yet at time a look of extraordinary kindness . She wa pale , but it wa a healthy pallor ; her face wa radiant with freshness and vigour . Her mouth wa rather small ; the full red lower lip projected a little a did her chin ; it wa the only irregularity in her beautiful face , but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression . Her face wa always more serious and thoughtful than gay ; but how well smile , how well youthful , lighthearted , irresponsible , laughter suited her face ! It wa natural enough that a warm , open , simple-hearted , honest giant like Razumihin , who had never seen anyone like her and wa not quite sober at the time , should lose his head immediately . Besides , a chance would have it , he saw Dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at meeting him . Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother ’ s insolent , cruel and ungrateful word -- and his fate wa sealed . He had spoken the truth , moreover , when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stair that Praskovya Pavlovna , Raskolnikov ’ s eccentric landlady , would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna a well a of Avdotya Romanovna on his account . Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa forty-three , her face still retained trace of her former beauty ; she looked much younger than her age , indeed , which is almost always the case with woman who retain serenity of spirit , sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age . We may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only mean of retaining beauty to old age . Her hair had begun to grow grey and thin , there had long been little crow ’ s foot wrinkle round her eye , her cheek were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief , and yet it wa a handsome face . She wa Dounia over again , twenty year older , but without the projecting underlip . Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa emotional , but not sentimental , timid and yielding , but only to a certain point . She could give way and accept a great deal even of what wa contrary to her conviction , but there wa a certain barrier fixed by honesty , principle and the deepest conviction which nothing would induce her to cross . Exactly twenty minute after Razumihin ’ s departure , there came two subdued but hurried knock at the door : he had come back . “ I won ’ t come in , I haven ’ t time , ” he hastened to say when the door wa opened . “ He sleep like a top , soundly , quietly , and God grant he may sleep ten hour . Nastasya ’ s with him ; I told her not to leave till I came . Now I am fetching Zossimov , he will report to you and then you ’ d better turn in ; I can see you are too tired to do anything .... ” And he ran off down the corridor . “ What a very competent and ... devoted young man ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted . “ He seems a splendid person ! ” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some warmth , resuming her walk up and down the room . It wa nearly an hour later when they heard footstep in the corridor and another knock at the door . Both woman waited this time completely relying on Razumihin ’ s promise ; he actually had succeeded in bringing Zossimov . Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to Raskolnikov ’ s , but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the lady , mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated condition . But his vanity wa at once reassured and flattered ; he saw that they were really expecting him a an oracle . He stayed just ten minute and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria Alexandrovna . He spoke with marked sympathy , but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation . He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relation with the two lady . Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya Romanovna , he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna . All this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction . He declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily . According to his observation the patient ’ s illness wa due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few month , but it had partly also a moral origin , “ wa , so to speak , the product of several material and moral influence , anxiety , apprehension , trouble , certain idea ... and so on. ” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna wa following his word with close attention , Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme . On Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s anxiously and timidly inquiring a to “ some suspicion of insanity , ” he replied with a composed and candid smile that his word had been exaggerated ; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea , something approaching a monomania -- he , Zossimov , wa now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine -- but that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in delirium and ... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind , “ if only all fresh shock can be avoided , ” he added significantly . Then he got up , took leave with an impressive and affable bow , while blessing , warm gratitude , and entreaty were showered upon him , and Avdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her hand to him . He went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself . “ We ’ ll talk to-morrow ; go to bed at once ! ” Razumihin said in conclusion , following Zossimov out . “ I ’ ll be with you to-morrow morning a early a possible with my report. ” “ That ’ s a fetching little girl , Avdotya Romanovna , ” remarked Zossimov , almost licking his lip a they both came out into the street . “ Fetching ? You said fetching ? ” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov and seized him by the throat . “ If you ever dare .... Do you understand ? Do you understand ? ” he shouted , shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against the wall . “ Do you hear ? ” “ Let me go , you drunken devil , ” said Zossimov , struggling and when he had let him go , he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw . Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection . “ Of course , I am an as , ” he observed , sombre a a storm cloud , “ but still ... you are another. ” “ No , brother , not at all such another . I am not dreaming of any folly. ” They walked along in silence and only when they were close to Raskolnikov ’ s lodging , Razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety . “ Listen , ” he said , “ you ’ re a first-rate fellow , but among your other failing , you ’ re a loose fish , that I know , and a dirty one , too . You are a feeble , nervous wretch , and a mass of whim , you ’ re getting fat and lazy and can ’ t deny yourself anything -- and I call that dirty because it lead one straight into the dirt . You ’ ve let yourself get so slack that I don ’ t know how it is you are still a good , even a devoted doctor . You -- a doctor -- sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your patient ! In another three or four year you won ’ t get up for your patient ... But hang it all , that ’ s not the point ! ... You are going to spend to-night in the landlady ’ s flat here . ( Hard work I ’ ve had to persuade her ! ) And I ’ ll be in the kitchen . So here ’ s a chance for you to get to know her better .... It ’ s not a you think ! There ’ s not a trace of anything of the sort , brother ... ! ” “ But I don ’ t think ! ” “ Here you have modesty , brother , silence , bashfulness , a savage virtue ... and yet she ’ s sighing and melting like wax , simply melting ! Save me from her , by all that ’ s unholy ! She ’ s most prepossessing ... I ’ ll repay you , I ’ ll do anything .... ” Zossimov laughed more violently than ever . “ Well , you are smitten ! But what am I to do with her ? ” “ It won ’ t be much trouble , I assure you . Talk any rot you like to her , a long a you sit by her and talk . You ’ re a doctor , too ; try curing her of something . I swear you won ’ t regret it . She ha a piano , and you know , I strum a little . I have a song there , a genuine Russian one : ‘ I shed hot tears. ’ She like the genuine article -- and well , it all began with that song ; Now you ’ re a regular performer , a _maître_ , a Rubinstein .... I assure you , you won ’ t regret it ! ” “ But have you made her some promise ? Something signed ? A promise of marriage , perhaps ? ” “ Nothing , nothing , absolutely nothing of the kind ! Besides she is not that sort at all .... Tchebarov tried that .... ” “ Well then , drop her ! ” “ But I can ’ t drop her like that ! ” “ Why can ’ t you ? ” “ Well , I can ’ t , that ’ s all about it ! There ’ s an element of attraction here , brother. ” “ Then why have you fascinated her ? ” “ I haven ’ t fascinated her ; perhaps I wa fascinated myself in my folly . But she won ’ t care a straw whether it ’ s you or I , so long a somebody sits beside her , sighing .... I can ’ t explain the position , brother ... look here , you are good at mathematics , and working at it now ... begin teaching her the integral calculus ; upon my soul , I ’ m not joking , I ’ m in earnest , it ’ ll be just the same to her . She will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together . I talked to her once for two day at a time about the Prussian House of Lords ( for one must talk of something ) -- she just sighed and perspired ! And you mustn ’ t talk of love -- she ’ s bashful to hysteric -- but just let her see you can ’ t tear yourself away -- that ’ s enough . It ’ s fearfully comfortable ; you ’ re quite at home , you can read , sit , lie about , write . You may even venture on a kiss , if you ’ re careful. ” “ But what do I want with her ? ” “ Ach , I can ’ t make you understand ! You see , you are made for each other ! I have often been reminded of you ! ... You ’ ll come to it in the end ! So doe it matter whether it ’ s sooner or later ? There ’ s the feather-bed element here , brother -- ach ! and not only that ! There ’ s an attraction here -- here you have the end of the world , an anchorage , a quiet haven , the navel of the earth , the three fish that are the foundation of the world , the essence of pancake , of savoury fish-pies , of the evening samovar , of soft sigh and warm shawl , and hot stove to sleep on -- a snug a though you were dead , and yet you ’ re alive -- the advantage of both at once ! Well , hang it , brother , what stuff I ’ m talking , it ’ s bedtime ! Listen . I sometimes wake up at night ; so I ’ ll go in and look at him . But there ’ s no need , it ’ s all right . Don ’ t you worry yourself , yet if you like , you might just look in once , too . But if you notice anything -- delirium or fever -- wake me at once . But there can ’ t be .... ” CHAPTER II Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o ’ clock , troubled and serious . He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexity . He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that . He remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him , that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before . At the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination wa hopelessly unattainable -- so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it , and he hastened to pas to the other more practical care and difficulty bequeathed him by that “ thrice accursed yesterday. ” The most awful recollection of the previous day wa the way he had shown himself “ base and mean , ” not only because he had been drunk , but because he had taken advantage of the young girl ’ s position to abuse her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy , knowing nothing of their mutual relation and obligation and next to nothing of the man himself . And what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner ? Who had asked for his opinion ? Was it thinkable that such a creature a Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money ? So there must be something in him . The lodging ? But after all how could he know the character of the lodging ? He wa furnishing a flat ... Foo ! how despicable it all wa ! And what justification wa it that he wa drunk ? Such a stupid excuse wa even more degrading ! In wine is truth , and the truth had all come out , “ that is , all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart ” ! And would such a dream ever be permissible to him , Razumihin ? What wa he beside such a girl -- he , the drunken noisy braggart of last night ? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition ? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stair that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna ... that wa simply intolerable . He brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove , hurt his hand and sent one of the brick flying . “ Of course , ” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-abasement , “ of course , all these infamy can never be wiped out or smoothed over ... and so it ’ s useless even to think of it , and I must go to them in silence and do my duty ... in silence , too ... and not ask forgiveness , and say nothing ... for all is lost now ! ” And yet a he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual . He hadn ’ t another suit -- if he had had , perhaps he wouldn ’ t have put it on . “ I would have made a point of not putting it on. ” But in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven ; he had no right to offend the feeling of others , especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them . He brushed his clothes carefully . His linen wa always decent ; in that respect he wa especially clean . He washed that morning scrupulously -- he got some soap from Nastasya -- he washed his hair , his neck and especially his hand . When it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not ( Praskovya Pavlovna had capital razor that had been left by her late husband ) , the question wa angrily answered in the negative . “ Let it stay a it is ! What if they think that I shaved on purpose to ... ? They certainly would think so ! Not on any account ! ” “ And ... the worst of it wa he wa so coarse , so dirty , he had the manner of a pothouse ; and ... and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essential of a gentleman ... what wa there in that to be proud of ? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that ... and all the same ( he remembered ) he , too , had done little thing ... not exactly dishonest , and yet .... And what thought he sometimes had ; hm ... and to set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna ! Confound it ! So be it ! Well , he ’ d make a point then of being dirty , greasy , pothouse in his manner and he wouldn ’ t care ! He ’ d be worse ! ” He wa engaged in such monologue when Zossimov , who had spent the night in Praskovya Pavlovna ’ s parlour , came in . He wa going home and wa in a hurry to look at the invalid first . Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov wa sleeping like a dormouse . Zossimov gave order that they shouldn ’ t wake him and promised to see him again about eleven . “ If he is still at home , ” he added . “ Damn it all ! If one can ’ t control one ’ s patient , how is one to cure them ? Do you know whether _he_ will go to them , or whether _they_ are coming here ? ” “ They are coming , I think , ” said Razumihin , understanding the object of the question , “ and they will discus their family affair , no doubt . I ’ ll be off . You , a the doctor , have more right to be here than I. ” “ But I am not a father confessor ; I shall come and go away ; I ’ ve plenty to do besides looking after them. ” “ One thing worry me , ” interposed Razumihin , frowning . “ On the way home I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him ... all sort of thing ... and amongst them that you were afraid that he ... might become insane. ” “ You told the lady so , too. ” “ I know it wa stupid ! You may beat me if you like ! Did you think so seriously ? ” “ That ’ s nonsense , I tell you , how could I think it seriously ? You , yourself , described him a a monomaniac when you fetched me to him ... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday , you did , that is , with your story about the painter ; it wa a nice conversation , when he wa , perhaps , mad on that very point ! If only I ’ d known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch ... had insulted him with this suspicion ! Hm ... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday . These monomaniac will make a mountain out of a mole-hill ... and see their fancy a solid reality .... As far a I remember , it wa Zametov ’ s story that cleared up half the mystery , to my mind . Why , I know one case in which a hypochondriac , a man of forty , cut the throat of a little boy of eight , because he couldn ’ t endure the joke he made every day at table ! And in this case his rag , the insolent police officer , the fever and this suspicion ! All that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria , and with his morbid exceptional vanity ! That may well have been the starting-point of illness . Well , bother it all ! ... And , by the way , that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow , but hm ... he shouldn ’ t have told all that last night . He is an awful chatterbox ! ” “ But whom did he tell it to ? You and me ? ” “ And Porfiry. ” “ What doe that matter ? ” “ And , by the way , have you any influence on them , his mother and sister ? Tell them to be more careful with him to-day .... ” “ They ’ ll get on all right ! ” Razumihin answered reluctantly . “ Why is he so set against this Luzhin ? A man with money and she doesn ’ t seem to dislike him ... and they haven ’ t a farthing , I suppose ? eh ? ” “ But what business is it of yours ? ” Razumihin cried with annoyance . “ How can I tell whether they ’ ve a farthing ? Ask them yourself and perhaps you ’ ll find out .... ” “ Foo ! what an as you are sometimes ! Last night ’ s wine ha not gone off yet .... Good-bye ; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night ’ s lodging . She locked herself in , made no reply to my _bonjour_ through the door ; she wa up at seven o ’ clock , the samovar wa taken into her from the kitchen . I wa not vouchsafed a personal interview .... ” At nine o ’ clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodging at Bakaleyev ’ s house . Both lady were waiting for him with nervous impatience . They had risen at seven o ’ clock or earlier . He entered looking a black a night , bowed awkwardly and wa at once furious with himself for it . He had reckoned without his host : Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at him , seized him by both hand and wa almost kissing them . He glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna , but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness , such complete and unlooked-for respect ( in place of the sneering look and ill-disguised contempt he had expected ) , that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse . Fortunately there wa a subject for conversation , and he made haste to snatch at it . Hearing that everything wa going well and that Rodya had not yet waked , Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she wa glad to hear it , because “ she had something which it wa very , very necessary to talk over beforehand. ” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them ; they had waited to have it with him . Avdotya Romanovna rang the bell : it wa answered by a ragged dirty waiter , and they asked him to bring tea which wa served at last , but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the lady were ashamed . Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodging , but , remembering Luzhin , stopped in embarrassment and wa greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s question , which showered in a continual stream upon him . He talked for three quarter of an hour , being constantly interrupted by their question , and succeeded in describing to them all the most important fact he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov ’ s life , concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness . He omitted , however , many thing , which were better omitted , including the scene at the police station with all it consequence . They listened eagerly to his story , and , when he thought he had finished and satisfied his listener , he found that they considered he had hardly begun . “ Tell me , tell me ! What do you think ... ? Excuse me , I still don ’ t know your name ! ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily . “ Dmitri Prokofitch. ” “ I should like very , very much to know , Dmitri Prokofitch ... how he look ... on thing in general now , that is , how can I explain , what are his like and dislike ? Is he always so irritable ? Tell me , if you can , what are his hope and , so to say , his dream ? Under what influence is he now ? In a word , I should like ... ” “ Ah , mother , how can he answer all that at once ? ” observed Dounia . “ Good heaven , I had not expected to find him in the least like this , Dmitri Prokofitch ! ” “ Naturally , ” answered Razumihin . “ I have no mother , but my uncle come every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me , even in appearance , though he is a clever man ; and your three year ’ separation mean a great deal . What am I to tell you ? I have known Rodion for a year and a half ; he is morose , gloomy , proud and haughty , and of late -- and perhaps for a long time before -- he ha been suspicious and fanciful . He ha a noble nature and a kind heart . He doe not like showing his feeling and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely . Sometimes , though , he is not at all morbid , but simply cold and inhumanly callous ; it ’ s a though he were alternating between two character . Sometimes he is fearfully reserved ! He say he is so busy that everything is a hindrance , and yet he lie in bed doing nothing . He doesn ’ t jeer at thing , not because he hasn ’ t the wit , but a though he hadn ’ t time to waste on such trifle . He never listens to what is said to him . He is never interested in what interest other people at any given moment . He think very highly of himself and perhaps he is right . Well , what more ? I think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him. ” “ God grant it may , ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna , distressed by Razumihin ’ s account of her Rodya . And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last . He glanced at her often while he wa talking , but only for a moment and looked away again at once . Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table , listening attentively , then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arm folded and her lip compressed , occasionally putting in a question , without stopping her walk . She had the same habit of not listening to what wa said . She wa wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck . Razumihin soon detected sign of extreme poverty in their belonging . Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen , he felt that he would not be afraid of her , but perhaps just because she wa poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings , his heart wa filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered , every gesture he made , which wa very trying for a man who already felt diffident . “ You ’ ve told u a great deal that is interesting about my brother ’ s character ... and have told it impartially . I am glad . I thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him , ” observed Avdotya Romanovna with a smile . “ I think you are right that he need a woman ’ s care , ” she added thoughtfully . “ I didn ’ t say so ; but I daresay you are right , only ... ” “ What ? ” “ He love no one and perhaps he never will , ” Razumihin declared decisively . “ You mean he is not capable of love ? ” “ Do you know , Avdotya Romanovna , you are awfully like your brother , in everything , indeed ! ” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise , but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother , he turned a red a a crab and wa overcome with confusion . Avdotya Romanovna couldn ’ t help laughing when she looked at him . “ You may both be mistaken about Rodya , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked , slightly piqued . “ I am not talking of our present difficulty , Dounia . What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have supposed may be mistaken , but you can ’ t imagine , Dmitri Prokofitch , how moody and , so to say , capricious he is . I never could depend on what he would do when he wa only fifteen . And I am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing ... Well , for instance , do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me , when he had the idea of marrying that girl -- what wa her name -- his landlady ’ s daughter ? ” “ Did you hear about that affair ? ” asked Avdotya Romanovna . “ Do you suppose -- -- ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly . “ Do you suppose that my tear , my entreaty , my illness , my possible death from grief , our poverty would have made him pause ? No , he would calmly have disregarded all obstacle . And yet it isn ’ t that he doesn ’ t love u ! ” “ He ha never spoken a word of that affair to me , ” Razumihin answered cautiously . “ But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself , though she is by no mean a gossip . And what I heard certainly wa rather strange. ” “ And what did you hear ? ” both the lady asked at once . “ Well , nothing very special . I only learned that the marriage , which only failed to take place through the girl ’ s death , wa not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna ’ s liking . They say , too , the girl wa not at all pretty , in fact I am told positively ugly ... and such an invalid ... and queer . But she seems to have had some good quality . She must have had some good quality or it ’ s quite inexplicable .... She had no money either and he wouldn ’ t have considered her money .... But it ’ s always difficult to judge in such matters. ” “ I am sure she wa a good girl , ” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly . “ God forgive me , I simply rejoiced at her death . Though I don ’ t know which of them would have caused most misery to the other -- he to her or she to him , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded . Then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin , hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia , obviously to the latter ’ s annoyance . This incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness , even consternation . Razumihin described it in detail again , but this time he added his own conclusion : he openly blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch , not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness . “ He had planned it before his illness , ” he added . “ I think so , too , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air . But she wa very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch . Avdotya Romanovna , too , wa struck by it . “ So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch ? ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not resist asking . “ I can have no other opinion of your daughter ’ s future husband , ” Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth , “ and I don ’ t say it simply from vulgar politeness , but because ... simply because Avdotya Romanovna ha of her own free will deigned to accept this man . If I spoke so rudely of him last night , it wa because I wa disgustingly drunk and ... mad besides ; yes , mad , crazy , I lost my head completely ... and this morning I am ashamed of it. ” He crimsoned and ceased speaking . Avdotya Romanovna flushed , but did not break the silence . She had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin . Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do . At last , faltering and continually glancing at her daughter , she confessed that she wa exceedingly worried by one circumstance . “ You see , Dmitri Prokofitch , ” she began . “ I ’ ll be perfectly open with Dmitri Prokofitch , Dounia ? ” “ Of course , mother , ” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically . “ This is what it is , ” she began in haste , a though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind . “ Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival . He promised to meet u at the station , you know ; instead of that he sent a servant to bring u the address of these lodging and to show u the way ; and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning . But this morning this note came from him . You ’ d better read it yourself ; there is one point in it which worry me very much ... you will soon see what that is , and ... tell me your candid opinion , Dmitri Prokofitch ! You know Rodya ’ s character better than anyone and no one can advise u better than you can . Dounia , I must tell you , made her decision at once , but I still don ’ t feel sure how to act and I ... I ’ ve been waiting for your opinion. ” Razumihin opened the note which wa dated the previous evening and read a follows : “ Dear Madam , Pulcheria Alexandrovna , I have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacle I wa rendered unable to meet you at the railway station ; I sent a very competent person with the same object in view . I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that doe not admit of delay , and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son , and Avdotya Romanovna her brother . I shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respect at your lodging not later than to-morrow evening at eight o ’ clock precisely , and herewith I venture to present my earnest and , I may add , imperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview -- a he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday , and , moreover , since I desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point , in regard to which I wish to learn your own interpretation . I have the honour to inform you , in anticipation , that if , in spite of my request , I meet Rodion Romanovitch , I shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame . I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit , suddenly recovered two hour later and so , being able to leave the house , may visit you also . I wa confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eye in the lodging of a drunken man who wa run over and ha since died , to whose daughter , a young woman of notorious behaviour , he gave twenty-five rouble on the pretext of the funeral , which gravely surprised me knowing what pain you were at to raise that sum . Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter , Avdotya Romanovna , I beg you to accept the respectful homage of “ Your humble servant , “ P . LUZHIN. ” “ What am I to do now , Dmitri Prokofitch ? ” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna , almost weeping . “ How can I ask Rodya not to come ? Yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive Rodya ! He will come on purpose if he know , and ... what will happen then ? ” “ Act on Avdotya Romanovna ’ s decision , ” Razumihin answered calmly at once . “ Oh , dear me ! She say ... goodness know what she say , she doesn ’ t explain her object ! She say that it would be best , at least , not that it would be best , but that it ’ s absolutely necessary that Rodya should make a point of being here at eight o ’ clock and that they must meet .... I didn ’ t want even to show him the letter , but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help ... because he is so irritable .... Besides I don ’ t understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter , and how he could have given the daughter all the money ... which ... ” “ Which cost you such sacrifice , mother , ” put in Avdotya Romanovna . “ He wa not himself yesterday , ” Razumihin said thoughtfully , “ if you only knew what he wa up to in a restaurant yesterday , though there wa sense in it too .... Hm ! He did say something , a we were going home yesterday evening , about a dead man and a girl , but I didn ’ t understand a word .... But last night , I myself ... ” “ The best thing , mother , will be for u to go to him ourselves and there I assure you we shall see at once what ’ s to be done . Besides , it ’ s getting late -- good heaven , it ’ s past ten , ” she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin Venetian chain , and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress . “ A present from her _fiancé_ , ” thought Razumihin . “ We must start , Dounia , we must start , ” her mother cried in a flutter . “ He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday , from our coming so late . Merciful heaven ! ” While she said this she wa hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle ; Dounia , too , put on her thing . Her glove , a Razumihin noticed , were not merely shabby but had hole in them , and yet this evident poverty gave the two lady an air of special dignity , which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes . Razumihin looked reverently at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her . “ The queen who mended her stocking in prison , ” he thought , “ must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquet and levées. ” “ My God ! ” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna , “ little did I think that I should ever fear seeing my son , my darling , darling Rodya ! I am afraid , Dmitri Prokofitch , ” she added , glancing at him timidly . “ Don ’ t be afraid , mother , ” said Dounia , kissing her , “ better have faith in him. ” “ Oh , dear , I have faith in him , but I haven ’ t slept all night , ” exclaimed the poor woman . They came out into the street . “ Do you know , Dounia , when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of Marfa Petrovna ... she wa all in white ... she came up to me , took my hand , and shook her head at me , but so sternly a though she were blaming me .... Is that a good omen ? Oh , dear me ! You don ’ t know , Dmitri Prokofitch , that Marfa Petrovna ’ s dead ! ” “ No , I didn ’ t know ; who is Marfa Petrovna ? ” “ She died suddenly ; and only fancy ... ” “ Afterwards , mamma , ” put in Dounia . “ He doesn ’ t know who Marfa Petrovna is. ” “ Ah , you don ’ t know ? And I wa thinking that you knew all about u . Forgive me , Dmitri Prokofitch , I don ’ t know what I am thinking about these last few day . I look upon you really a a providence for u , and so I took it for granted that you knew all about u . I look on you a a relation .... Don ’ t be angry with me for saying so . Dear me , what ’ s the matter with your right hand ? Have you knocked it ? ” “ Yes , I bruised it , ” muttered Razumihin overjoyed . “ I sometimes speak too much from the heart , so that Dounia find fault with me .... But , dear me , what a cupboard he life in ! I wonder whether he is awake ? Does this woman , his landlady , consider it a room ? Listen , you say he doe not like to show his feeling , so perhaps I shall annoy him with my ... weakness ? Do advise me , Dmitri Prokofitch , how am I to treat him ? I feel quite distracted , you know. ” “ Don ’ t question him too much about anything if you see him frown ; don ’ t ask him too much about his health ; he doesn ’ t like that. ” “ Ah , Dmitri Prokofitch , how hard it is to be a mother ! But here are the stair .... What an awful staircase ! ” “ Mother , you are quite pale , don ’ t distress yourself , darling , ” said Dounia caressing her , then with flashing eye she added : “ He ought to be happy at seeing you , and you are tormenting yourself so. ” “ Wait , I ’ ll peep in and see whether he ha waked up. ” The lady slowly followed Razumihin , who went on before , and when they reached the landlady ’ s door on the fourth storey , they noticed that her door wa a tiny crack open and that two keen black eye were watching them from the darkness within . When their eye met , the door wa suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried out . CHAPTER III “ He is well , quite well ! ” Zossimov cried cheerfully a they entered . He had come in ten minute earlier and wa sitting in the same place a before , on the sofa . Raskolnikov wa sitting in the opposite corner , fully dressed and carefully washed and combed , a he had not been for some time past . The room wa immediately crowded , yet Nastasya managed to follow the visitor in and stayed to listen . Raskolnikov really wa almost well , a compared with his condition the day before , but he wa still pale , listless , and sombre . He looked like a wounded man or one who ha undergone some terrible physical suffering . His brow were knitted , his lip compressed , his eye feverish . He spoke little and reluctantly , a though performing a duty , and there wa a restlessness in his movement . He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm . The pale , sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister entered , but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering , in place of it listless dejection . The light soon died away , but the look of suffering remained , and Zossimov , watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise , noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister , but a sort of bitter , hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture . He saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it . But at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feeling in a patient who the previous day had , like a monomaniac , fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word . “ Yes , I see myself now that I am almost well , ” said Raskolnikov , giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria Alexandrovna radiant at once . “ And I don ’ t say this _as I did yesterday_ , ” he said , addressing Razumihin , with a friendly pressure of his hand . “ Yes , indeed , I am quite surprised at him to-day , ” began Zossimov , much delighted at the lady ’ entrance , for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minute . “ In another three or four day , if he go on like this , he will be just a before , that is , a he wa a month ago , or two ... or perhaps even three . This ha been coming on for a long while .... eh ? Confess , now , that it ha been perhaps your own fault ? ” he added , with a tentative smile , a though still afraid of irritating him . “ It is very possible , ” answered Raskolnikov coldly . “ I should say , too , ” continued Zossimov with zest , “ that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself . Now that one can talk to you , I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary , so to speak , fundamental cause tending to produce your morbid condition : in that case you will be cured , if not , it will go from bad to worse . These fundamental cause I don ’ t know , but they must be known to you . You are an intelligent man , and must have observed yourself , of course . I fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university . You must not be left without occupation , and so , work and a definite aim set before you might , I fancy , be very beneficial. ” “ Yes , yes ; you are perfectly right .... I will make haste and return to the university : and then everything will go smoothly .... ” Zossimov , who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the lady , wa certainly somewhat mystified , when , glancing at his patient , he observed unmistakable mockery on his face . This lasted an instant , however . Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking Zossimov , especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night . “ What ! he saw you last night ? ” Raskolnikov asked , a though startled . “ Then you have not slept either after your journey. ” “ Ach , Rodya , that wa only till two o ’ clock . Dounia and I never go to bed before two at home. ” “ I don ’ t know how to thank him either , ” Raskolnikov went on , suddenly frowning and looking down . “ Setting aside the question of payment -- forgive me for referring to it ( he turned to Zossimov ) -- I really don ’ t know what I have done to deserve such special attention from you ! I simply don ’ t understand it ... and ... and ... it weighs upon me , indeed , because I don ’ t understand it . I tell you so candidly. ” “ Don ’ t be irritated. ” Zossimov forced himself to laugh . “ Assume that you are my first patient -- well -- we fellow just beginning to practise love our first patient a if they were our child , and some almost fall in love with them . And , of course , I am not rich in patients. ” “ I say nothing about him , ” added Raskolnikov , pointing to Razumihin , “ though he ha had nothing from me either but insult and trouble. ” “ What nonsense he is talking ! Why , you are in a sentimental mood to-day , are you ? ” shouted Razumihin . If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there wa no trace of sentimentality in him , but something indeed quite the opposite . But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it . She wa intently and uneasily watching her brother . “ As for you , mother , I don ’ t dare to speak , ” he went on , a though repeating a lesson learned by heart . “ It is only to-day that I have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday , waiting for me to come back. ” When he had said this , he suddenly held out his hand to his sister , smiling without a word . But in this smile there wa a flash of real unfeigned feeling . Dounia caught it at once , and warmly pressed his hand , overjoyed and thankful . It wa the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous day . The mother ’ s face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation . “ Yes , that is what I love him for , ” Razumihin , exaggerating it all , muttered to himself , with a vigorous turn in his chair . “ He ha these movements. ” “ And how well he doe it all , ” the mother wa thinking to herself . “ What generous impulse he ha , and how simply , how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding with his sister -- simply by holding out his hand at the right minute and looking at her like that .... And what fine eye he ha , and how fine his whole face is ! ... He is even better looking than Dounia .... But , good heaven , what a suit -- how terribly he ’ s dressed ! ... Vasya , the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch ’ s shop , is better dressed ! I could rush at him and hug him ... weep over him -- but I am afraid .... Oh , dear , he ’ s so strange ! He ’ s talking kindly , but I ’ m afraid ! Why , what am I afraid of ? ... ” “ Oh , Rodya , you wouldn ’ t believe , ” she began suddenly , in haste to answer his word to her , “ how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday ! Now that it ’ s all over and done with and we are quite happy again -- I can tell you . Fancy , we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman -- ah , here she is ! Good morning , Nastasya ! ... She told u at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium , and they were looking for you in the street . You can ’ t imagine how we felt ! I couldn ’ t help thinking of the tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov , a friend of your father ’ s -- you can ’ t remember him , Rodya -- who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn ’ t pull him out till next day . Of course , we exaggerated thing . We were on the point of rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help .... Because we were alone , utterly alone , ” she said plaintively and stopped short , suddenly , recollecting it wa still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr Petrovitch , although “ we are quite happy again. ” “ Yes , yes .... Of course it ’ s very annoying .... ” Raskolnikov muttered in reply , but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed at him in perplexity . “ What else wa it I wanted to say ? ” He went on trying to recollect . “ Oh , yes ; mother , and you too , Dounia , please don ’ t think that I didn ’ t mean to come and see you to-day and wa waiting for you to come first. ” “ What are you saying , Rodya ? ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . She , too , wa surprised . “ Is he answering u a a duty ? ” Dounia wondered . “ Is he being reconciled and asking forgiveness a though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson ? ” “ I ’ ve only just waked up , and wanted to go to you , but wa delayed owing to my clothes ; I forgot yesterday to ask her ... Nastasya ... to wash out the blood ... I ’ ve only just dressed. ” “ Blood ! What blood ? ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm . “ Oh , nothing -- don ’ t be uneasy . It wa when I wa wandering about yesterday , rather delirious , I chanced upon a man who had been run over ... a clerk ... ” “ Delirious ? But you remember everything ! ” Razumihin interrupted . “ That ’ s true , ” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness . “ I remember everything even to the slightest detail , and yet -- why I did that and went there and said that , I can ’ t clearly explain now. ” “ A familiar phenomenon , ” interposed Zossimov , “ action are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way , while the direction of the action is deranged and dependent on various morbid impression -- it ’ s like a dream. ” “ Perhaps it ’ s a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Why , people in perfect health act in the same way too , ” observed Dounia , looking uneasily at Zossimov . “ There is some truth in your observation , ” the latter replied . “ In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madman , but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder , for we must draw a line . A normal man , it is true , hardly exists . Among dozen -- perhaps hundred of thousand -- hardly one is to be met with. ” At the word “ madman , ” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject , everyone frowned . Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention , plunged in thought with a strange smile on his pale lip . He wa still meditating on something . “ Well , what about the man who wa run over ? I interrupted you ! ” Razumihin cried hastily . “ What ? ” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up . “ Oh ... I got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging . By the way , mamma , I did an unpardonable thing yesterday . I wa literally out of my mind . I gave away all the money you sent me ... to his wife for the funeral . She ’ s a widow now , in consumption , a poor creature ... three little child , starving ... nothing in the house ... there ’ s a daughter , too ... perhaps you ’ d have given it yourself if you ’ d seen them . But I had no right to do it I admit , especially a I knew how you needed the money yourself . To help others one must have the right to do it , or else _Crevez , chiens , si vous n ’ êtes pa contents_. ” He laughed , “ That ’ s right , isn ’ t it , Dounia ? ” “ No , it ’ s not , ” answered Dounia firmly . “ Bah ! you , too , have ideal , ” he muttered , looking at her almost with hatred , and smiling sarcastically . “ I ought to have considered that .... Well , that ’ s praiseworthy , and it ’ s better for you ... and if you reach a line you won ’ t overstep , you will be unhappy ... and if you overstep it , maybe you will be still unhappier .... But all that ’ s nonsense , ” he added irritably , vexed at being carried away . “ I only meant to say that I beg your forgiveness , mother , ” he concluded , shortly and abruptly . “ That ’ s enough , Rodya , I am sure that everything you do is very good , ” said his mother , delighted . “ Don ’ t be too sure , ” he answered , twisting his mouth into a smile . A silence followed . There wa a certain constraint in all this conversation , and in the silence , and in the reconciliation , and in the forgiveness , and all were feeling it . “ It is a though they were afraid of me , ” Raskolnikov wa thinking to himself , looking askance at his mother and sister . Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent . “ Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much , ” flashed through his mind . “ Do you know , Rodya , Marfa Petrovna is dead , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly blurted out . “ What Marfa Petrovna ? ” “ Oh , mercy on u -- Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov . I wrote you so much about her. ” “ A-a-h ! Yes , I remember .... So she ’ s dead ! Oh , really ? ” he roused himself suddenly , a if waking up . “ What did she die of ? ” “ Only imagine , quite suddenly , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered hurriedly , encouraged by his curiosity . “ On the very day I wa sending you that letter ! Would you believe it , that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death . They say he beat her dreadfully. ” “ Why , were they on such bad term ? ” he asked , addressing his sister . “ Not at all . Quite the contrary indeed . With her , he wa always very patient , considerate even . In fact , all those seven year of their married life he gave way to her , too much so indeed , in many case . All of a sudden he seems to have lost patience. ” “ Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven year ? You seem to be defending him , Dounia ? ” “ No , no , he ’ s an awful man ! I can imagine nothing more awful ! ” Dounia answered , almost with a shudder , knitting her brow , and sinking into thought . “ That had happened in the morning , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on hurriedly . “ And directly afterwards she ordered the horse to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner . She always used to drive to the town in such case . She ate a very good dinner , I am told .... ” “ After the beating ? ” “ That wa always her ... habit ; and immediately after dinner , so a not to be late in starting , she went to the bath-house .... You see , she wa undergoing some treatment with bath . They have a cold spring there , and she used to bathe in it regularly every day , and no sooner had she got into the water when she suddenly had a stroke ! ” “ I should think so , ” said Zossimov . “ And did he beat her badly ? ” “ What doe that matter ! ” put in Dounia . “ H ’ m ! But I don ’ t know why you want to tell u such gossip , mother , ” said Raskolnikov irritably , a it were in spite of himself . “ Ah , my dear , I don ’ t know what to talk about , ” broke from Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Why , are you all afraid of me ? ” he asked , with a constrained smile . “ That ’ s certainly true , ” said Dounia , looking directly and sternly at her brother . “ Mother wa crossing herself with terror a she came up the stairs. ” His face worked , a though in convulsion . “ Ach , what are you saying , Dounia ! Don ’ t be angry , please , Rodya .... Why did you say that , Dounia ? ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began , overwhelmed -- “ You see , coming here , I wa dreaming all the way , in the train , how we should meet , how we should talk over everything together .... And I wa so happy , I did not notice the journey ! But what am I saying ? I am happy now .... You should not , Dounia .... I am happy now -- simply in seeing you , Rodya .... ” “ Hush , mother , ” he muttered in confusion , not looking at her , but pressing her hand . “ We shall have time to speak freely of everything ! ” As he said this , he wa suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned pale . Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul . Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie -- that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything -- that he would never again be able to _speak_ of anything to anyone . The anguish of this thought wa such that for a moment he almost forgot himself . He got up from his seat , and not looking at anyone walked towards the door . “ What are you about ? ” cried Razumihin , clutching him by the arm . He sat down again , and began looking about him , in silence . They were all looking at him in perplexity . “ But what are you all so dull for ? ” he shouted , suddenly and quite unexpectedly . “ Do say something ! What ’ s the use of sitting like this ? Come , do speak . Let u talk .... We meet together and sit in silence .... Come , anything ! ” “ Thank God ; I wa afraid the same thing a yesterday wa beginning again , ” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna , crossing herself . “ What is the matter , Rodya ? ” asked Avdotya Romanovna , distrustfully . “ Oh , nothing ! I remembered something , ” he answered , and suddenly laughed . “ Well , if you remembered something ; that ’ s all right ! ... I wa beginning to think ... ” muttered Zossimov , getting up from the sofa . “ It is time for me to be off . I will look in again perhaps ... if I can ... ” He made his bow , and went out . “ What an excellent man ! ” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Yes , excellent , splendid , well-educated , intelligent , ” Raskolnikov began , suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity , and a liveliness he had not shown till then . “ I can ’ t remember where I met him before my illness .... I believe I have met him somewhere -- -- ... And this is a good man , too , ” he nodded at Razumihin . “ Do you like him , Dounia ? ” he asked her ; and suddenly , for some unknown reason , laughed . “ Very much , ” answered Dounia . “ Foo ! -- what a pig you are ! ” Razumihin protested , blushing in terrible confusion , and he got up from his chair . Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled faintly , but Raskolnikov laughed aloud . “ Where are you off to ? ” “ I must go. ” “ You need not at all . Stay . Zossimov ha gone , so you must . Don ’ t go . What ’ s the time ? Is it twelve o ’ clock ? What a pretty watch you have got , Dounia . But why are you all silent again ? I do all the talking. ” “ It wa a present from Marfa Petrovna , ” answered Dounia . “ And a very expensive one ! ” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ A-ah ! What a big one ! Hardly like a lady ’ s. ” “ I like that sort , ” said Dounia . “ So it is not a present from her _fiancé_ , ” thought Razumihin , and wa unreasonably delighted . “ I thought it wa Luzhin ’ s present , ” observed Raskolnikov . “ No , he ha not made Dounia any present yet. ” “ A-ah ! And do you remember , mother , I wa in love and wanted to get married ? ” he said suddenly , looking at his mother , who wa disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it . “ Oh , yes , my dear. ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glance with Dounia and Razumihin . “ H ’ m , yes . What shall I tell you ? I don ’ t remember much indeed . She wa such a sickly girl , ” he went on , growing dreamy and looking down again . “ Quite an invalid . She wa fond of giving alms to the poor , and wa always dreaming of a nunnery , and once she burst into tear when she began talking to me about it . Yes , yes , I remember . I remember very well . She wa an ugly little thing . I really don ’ t know what drew me to her then -- I think it wa because she wa always ill . If she had been lame or hunchback , I believe I should have liked her better still , ” he smiled dreamily . “ Yes , it wa a sort of spring delirium. ” “ No , it wa not only spring delirium , ” said Dounia , with warm feeling . He fixed a strained intent look on his sister , but did not hear or did not understand her word . Then , completely lost in thought , he got up , went up to his mother , kissed her , went back to his place and sat down . “ You love her even now ? ” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna , touched . “ Her ? Now ? Oh , yes .... You ask about her ? No ... that ’ s all now , a it were , in another world ... and so long ago . And indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away. ” He looked attentively at them . “ You , now ... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand mile away ... but , goodness know why we are talking of that ! And what ’ s the use of asking about it ? ” he added with annoyance , and biting his nail , fell into dreamy silence again . “ What a wretched lodging you have , Rodya ! It ’ s like a tomb , ” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna , suddenly breaking the oppressive silence . “ I am sure it ’ s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy. ” “ My lodging , ” he answered , listlessly . “ Yes , the lodging had a great deal to do with it .... I thought that , too .... If only you knew , though , what a strange thing you said just now , mother , ” he said , laughing strangely . A little more , and their companionship , this mother and this sister , with him after three year ’ absence , this intimate tone of conversation , in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything , would have been beyond his power of endurance . But there wa one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that day -- so he had decided when he woke . Now he wa glad to remember it , a a mean of escape . “ Listen , Dounia , ” he began , gravely and drily , “ of course I beg your pardon for yesterday , but I consider it my duty to tell you again that I do not withdraw from my chief point . It is me or Luzhin . If I am a scoundrel , you must not be . One is enough . If you marry Luzhin , I cease at once to look on you a a sister. ” “ Rodya , Rodya ! It is the same a yesterday again , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried , mournfully . “ And why do you call yourself a scoundrel ? I can ’ t bear it . You said the same yesterday. ” “ Brother , ” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness . “ In all this there is a mistake on your part . I thought it over at night , and found out the mistake . It is all because you seem to fancy I am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone . That is not the case at all . I am simply marrying for my own sake , because thing are hard for me . Though , of course , I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to my family . But that is not the chief motive for my decision .... ” “ She is lying , ” he thought to himself , biting his nail vindictively . “ Proud creature ! She won ’ t admit she want to do it out of charity ! Too haughty ! Oh , base character ! They even love a though they hate .... Oh , how I ... hate them all ! ” “ In fact , ” continued Dounia , “ I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of two evil I choose the le . I intend to do honestly all he expects of me , so I am not deceiving him .... Why did you smile just now ? ” She , too , flushed , and there wa a gleam of anger in her eye . “ All ? ” he asked , with a malignant grin . “ Within certain limit . Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s courtship showed me at once what he wanted . He may , of course , think too well of himself , but I hope he esteem me , too .... Why are you laughing again ? ” “ And why are you blushing again ? You are lying , sister . You are intentionally lying , simply from feminine obstinacy , simply to hold your own against me .... You can not respect Luzhin . I have seen him and talked with him . So you are selling yourself for money , and so in any case you are acting basely , and I am glad at least that you can blush for it. ” “ It is not true . I am not lying , ” cried Dounia , losing her composure . “ I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteem me and think highly of me . I would not marry him if I were not firmly convinced that I can respect him . Fortunately , I can have convincing proof of it this very day ... and such a marriage is not a vileness , a you say ! And even if you were right , if I really had determined on a vile action , is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that ? Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either ? It is despotism ; it is tyranny . If I ruin anyone , it is only myself .... I am not committing a murder . Why do you look at me like that ? Why are you so pale ? Rodya , darling , what ’ s the matter ? ” “ Good heaven ! You have made him faint , ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ No , no , nonsense ! It ’ s nothing . A little giddiness -- not fainting . You have fainting on the brain . H ’ m , yes , what wa I saying ? Oh , yes . In what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him , and that he ... esteem you , a you said . I think you said to-day ? ” “ Mother , show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s letter , ” said Dounia . With trembling hand , Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter . He took it with great interest , but , before opening it , he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at Dounia . “ It is strange , ” he said , slowly , a though struck by a new idea . “ What am I making such a fuss for ? What is it all about ? Marry whom you like ! ” He said this a though to himself , but said it aloud , and looked for some time at his sister , a though puzzled . He opened the letter at last , still with the same look of strange wonder on his face . Then , slowly and attentively , he began reading , and read it through twice . Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety , and all indeed expected something particular . “ What surprise me , ” he began , after a short pause , handing the letter to his mother , but not addressing anyone in particular , “ is that he is a business man , a lawyer , and his conversation is pretentious indeed , and yet he writes such an uneducated letter. ” They all started . They had expected something quite different . “ But they all write like that , you know , ” Razumihin observed , abruptly . “ Have you read it ? ” “ Yes. ” “ We showed him , Rodya . We ... consulted him just now , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began , embarrassed . “ That ’ s just the jargon of the court , ” Razumihin put in . “ Legal document are written like that to this day. ” “ Legal ? Yes , it ’ s just legal -- business language -- not so very uneducated , and not quite educated -- business language ! ” “ Pyotr Petrovitch make no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education , he is proud indeed of having made his own way , ” Avdotya Romanovna observed , somewhat offended by her brother ’ s tone . “ Well , if he ’ s proud of it , he ha reason , I don ’ t deny it . You seem to be offended , sister , at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter , and to think that I speak of such trifling matter on purpose to annoy you . It is quite the contrary , an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no mean irrelevant a thing stand . There is one expression , ‘ blame yourselves ’ put in very significantly and plainly , and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I am present . That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient , and to abandon you now after summoning you to Petersburg . Well , what do you think ? Can one resent such an expression from Luzhin , a we should if he ( he pointed to Razumihin ) had written it , or Zossimov , or one of u ? ” “ N-no , ” answered Dounia , with more animation . “ I saw clearly that it wa too naïvely expressed , and that perhaps he simply ha no skill in writing ... that is a true criticism , brother . I did not expect , indeed ... ” “ It is expressed in legal style , and sound coarser than perhaps he intended . But I must disillusion you a little . There is one expression in the letter , one slander about me , and rather a contemptible one . I gave the money last night to the widow , a woman in consumption , crushed with trouble , and not ‘ on the pretext of the funeral , ’ but simply to pay for the funeral , and not to the daughter -- a young woman , a he writes , of notorious behaviour ( whom I saw last night for the first time in my life ) -- but to the widow . In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between u . It is expressed again in legal jargon , that is to say , with a too obvious display of the aim , and with a very naïve eagerness . He is a man of intelligence , but to act sensibly , intelligence is not enough . It all show the man and ... I don ’ t think he ha a great esteem for you . I tell you this simply to warn you , because I sincerely wish for your good ... ” Dounia did not reply . Her resolution had been taken . She wa only awaiting the evening . “ Then what is your decision , Rodya ? ” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna , who wa more uneasy than ever at the sudden , new businesslike tone of his talk . “ What decision ? ” “ You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with u this evening , and that he will go away if you come . So will you ... come ? ” “ That , of course , is not for me to decide , but for you first , if you are not offended by such a request ; and secondly , by Dounia , if she , too , is not offended . I will do what you think best , ” he added , drily . “ Dounia ha already decided , and I fully agree with her , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare . “ I decided to ask you , Rodya , to urge you not to fail to be with u at this interview , ” said Dounia . “ Will you come ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I will ask you , too , to be with u at eight o ’ clock , ” she said , addressing Razumihin . “ Mother , I am inviting him , too. ” “ Quite right , Dounia . Well , since you have decided , ” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna , “ so be it . I shall feel easier myself . I do not like concealment and deception . Better let u have the whole truth .... Pyotr Petrovitch may be angry or not , now ! ” CHAPTER IV At that moment the door wa softly opened , and a young girl walked into the room , looking timidly about her . Everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity . At first sight , Raskolnikov did not recognise her . It wa Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov . He had seen her yesterday for the first time , but at such a moment , in such surroundings and in such a dress , that his memory retained a very different image of her . Now she wa a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl , very young , indeed , almost like a child , with a modest and refined manner , with a candid but somewhat frightened-looking face . She wa wearing a very plain indoor dress , and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat , but she still carried a parasol . Unexpectedly finding the room full of people , she wa not so much embarrassed a completely overwhelmed with shyness , like a little child . She wa even about to retreat . “ Oh ... it ’ s you ! ” said Raskolnikov , extremely astonished , and he , too , wa confused . He at once recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin ’ s letter of “ some young woman of notorious behaviour. ” He had only just been protesting against Luzhin ’ s calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time , and suddenly she had walked in . He remembered , too , that he had not protested against the expression “ of notorious behaviour. ” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain , but looking at her more intently , he saw that the humiliated creature wa so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her . When she made a movement to retreat in terror , it sent a pang to his heart . “ I did not expect you , ” he said , hurriedly , with a look that made her stop . “ Please sit down . You come , no doubt , from Katerina Ivanovna . Allow me -- not there . Sit here .... ” At Sonia ’ s entrance , Razumihin , who had been sitting on one of Raskolnikov ’ s three chair , close to the door , got up to allow her to enter . Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting , but feeling that the sofa which served him a a bed , wa too _familiar_ a place , he hurriedly motioned her to Razumihin ’ s chair . “ You sit here , ” he said to Razumihin , putting him on the sofa . Sonia sat down , almost shaking with terror , and looked timidly at the two lady . It wa evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them . At the thought of it , she wa so frightened that she hurriedly got up again , and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov . “ I ... I ... have come for one minute . Forgive me for disturbing you , ” she began falteringly . “ I come from Katerina Ivanovna , and she had no one to send . Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you ... to be at the service ... in the morning ... at Mitrofanievsky ... and then ... to u ... to her ... to do her the honour ... she told me to beg you ... ” Sonia stammered and ceased speaking . “ I will try , certainly , most certainly , ” answered Raskolnikov . He , too , stood up , and he , too , faltered and could not finish his sentence . “ Please sit down , ” he said , suddenly . “ I want to talk to you . You are perhaps in a hurry , but please , be so kind , spare me two minute , ” and he drew up a chair for her . Sonia sat down again , and again timidly she took a hurried , frightened look at the two lady , and dropped her eye . Raskolnikov ’ s pale face flushed , a shudder passed over him , his eye glowed . “ Mother , ” he said , firmly and insistently , “ this is Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov , the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov , who wa run over yesterday before my eye , and of whom I wa just telling you. ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia , and slightly screwed up her eye . In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya ’ s urgent and challenging look , she could not deny herself that satisfaction . Dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl ’ s face , and scrutinised her with perplexity . Sonia , hearing herself introduced , tried to raise her eye again , but wa more embarrassed than ever . “ I wanted to ask you , ” said Raskolnikov , hastily , “ how thing were arranged yesterday . You were not worried by the police , for instance ? ” “ No , that wa all right ... it wa too evident , the cause of death ... they did not worry u ... only the lodger are angry. ” “ Why ? ” “ At the body ’ s remaining so long . You see it is hot now . So that , to-day , they will carry it to the cemetery , into the chapel , until to-morrow . At first Katerina Ivanovna wa unwilling , but now she see herself that it ’ s necessary ... ” “ To-day , then ? ” “ She begs you to do u the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the service , and then to be present at the funeral lunch. ” “ She is giving a funeral lunch ? ” “ Yes ... just a little .... She told me to thank you very much for helping u yesterday . But for you , we should have had nothing for the funeral. ” All at once her lip and chin began trembling , but , with an effort , she controlled herself , looking down again . During the conversation , Raskolnikov watched her carefully . She had a thin , very thin , pale little face , rather irregular and angular , with a sharp little nose and chin . She could not have been called pretty , but her blue eye were so clear , and when they lighted up , there wa such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted . Her face , and her whole figure indeed , had another peculiar characteristic . In spite of her eighteen year , she looked almost a little girl -- almost a child . And in some of her gesture , this childishness seemed almost absurd . “ But ha Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small mean ? Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch ? ” Raskolnikov asked , persistently keeping up the conversation . “ The coffin will be plain , of course ... and everything will be plain , so it won ’ t cost much . Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out , so that there will be enough left ... and Katerina Ivanovna wa very anxious it should be so . You know one can ’ t ... it ’ s a comfort to her ... she is like that , you know .... ” “ I understand , I understand ... of course ... why do you look at my room like that ? My mother ha just said it is like a tomb. ” “ You gave u everything yesterday , ” Sonia said suddenly , in reply , in a loud rapid whisper ; and again she looked down in confusion . Her lip and chin were trembling once more . She had been struck at once by Raskolnikov ’ s poor surroundings , and now these word broke out spontaneously . A silence followed . There wa a light in Dounia ’ s eye , and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia . “ Rodya , ” she said , getting up , “ we shall have dinner together , of course . Come , Dounia .... And you , Rodya , had better go for a little walk , and then rest and lie down before you come to see u .... I am afraid we have exhausted you .... ” “ Yes , yes , I ’ ll come , ” he answered , getting up fussily . “ But I have something to see to. ” “ But surely you will have dinner together ? ” cried Razumihin , looking in surprise at Raskolnikov . “ What do you mean ? ” “ Yes , yes , I am coming ... of course , of course ! And you stay a minute . You do not want him just now , do you , mother ? Or perhaps I am taking him from you ? ” “ Oh , no , no . And will you , Dmitri Prokofitch , do u the favour of dining with u ? ” “ Please do , ” added Dounia . Razumihin bowed , positively radiant . For one moment , they were all strangely embarrassed . “ Good-bye , Rodya , that is till we meet . I do not like saying good-bye . Good-bye , Nastasya . Ah , I have said good-bye again. ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia , too ; but it somehow failed to come off , and she went in a flutter out of the room . But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn , and following her mother out , gave Sonia an attentive , courteous bow . Sonia , in confusion , gave a hurried , frightened curtsy . There wa a look of poignant discomfort in her face , a though Avdotya Romanovna ’ s courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her . “ Dounia , good-bye , ” called Raskolnikov , in the passage . “ Give me your hand. ” “ Why , I did give it to you . Have you forgotten ? ” said Dounia , turning warmly and awkwardly to him . “ Never mind , give it to me again. ” And he squeezed her finger warmly . Dounia smiled , flushed , pulled her hand away , and went off quite happy . “ Come , that ’ s capital , ” he said to Sonia , going back and looking brightly at her . “ God give peace to the dead , the living have still to live . That is right , isn ’ t it ? ” Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face . He looked at her for some moment in silence . The whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moment .... * * * * * “ Heavens , Dounia , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began , a soon a they were in the street , “ I really feel relieved myself at coming away -- more at ease . How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad of that. ” “ I tell you again , mother , he is still very ill. Don ’ t you see it ? Perhaps worrying about u upset him . We must be patient , and much , much can be forgiven. ” “ Well , you were not very patient ! ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up , hotly and jealously . “ Do you know , Dounia , I wa looking at you two . You are the very portrait of him , and not so much in face a in soul . You are both melancholy , both morose and hot-tempered , both haughty and both generous .... Surely he can ’ t be an egoist , Dounia . Eh ? When I think of what is in store for u this evening , my heart sink ! ” “ Don ’ t be uneasy , mother . What must be , will be. ” “ Dounia , only think what a position we are in ! What if Pyotr Petrovitch break it off ? ” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out , incautiously . “ He won ’ t be worth much if he doe , ” answered Dounia , sharply and contemptuously . “ We did well to come away , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in . “ He wa in a hurry about some business or other . If he get out and ha a breath of air ... it is fearfully close in his room .... But where is one to get a breath of air here ? The very street here feel like shut-up room . Good heaven ! what a town ! ... stay ... this side ... they will crush you -- carrying something . Why , it is a piano they have got , I declare ... how they push ! ... I am very much afraid of that young woman , too. ” “ What young woman , mother ? “ Why , that Sofya Semyonovna , who wa there just now. ” “ Why ? ” “ I have a presentiment , Dounia . Well , you may believe it or not , but a soon a she came in , that very minute , I felt that she wa the chief cause of the trouble .... ” “ Nothing of the sort ! ” cried Dounia , in vexation . “ What nonsense , with your presentiment , mother ! He only made her acquaintance the evening before , and he did not know her when she came in. ” “ Well , you will see .... She worry me ; but you will see , you will see ! I wa so frightened . She wa gazing at me with those eye . I could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her , do you remember ? It seems so strange , but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that about her , and he introduces her to u -- to you ! So he must think a great deal of her. ” “ People will write anything . We were talked about and written about , too . Have you forgotten ? I am sure that she is a good girl , and that it is all nonsense. ” “ God grant it may be ! ” “ And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer , ” Dounia snapped out , suddenly . Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa crushed ; the conversation wa not resumed . * * * * * “ I will tell you what I want with you , ” said Raskolnikov , drawing Razumihin to the window . “ Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming , ” Sonia said hurriedly , preparing to depart . “ One minute , Sofya Semyonovna . We have no secret . You are not in our way . I want to have another word or two with you . Listen ! ” he turned suddenly to Razumihin again . “ You know that ... what ’ s his name ... Porfiry Petrovitch ? ” “ I should think so ! He is a relation . Why ? ” added the latter , with interest . “ Is not he managing that case ... you know , about that murder ? ... You were speaking about it yesterday. ” “ Yes ... well ? ” Razumihin ’ s eye opened wide . “ He wa inquiring for people who had pawned thing , and I have some pledge there , too -- trifle -- a ring my sister gave me a a keepsake when I left home , and my father ’ s silver watch -- they are only worth five or six rouble altogether ... but I value them . So what am I to do now ? I do not want to lose the thing , especially the watch . I wa quaking just now , for fear mother would ask to look at it , when we spoke of Dounia ’ s watch . It is the only thing of father ’ s left u . She would be ill if it were lost . You know what woman are . So tell me what to do . I know I ought to have given notice at the police station , but would it not be better to go straight to Porfiry ? Eh ? What do you think ? The matter might be settled more quickly . You see , mother may ask for it before dinner. ” “ Certainly not to the police station . Certainly to Porfiry , ” Razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement . “ Well , how glad I am . Let u go at once . It is a couple of step . We shall be sure to find him. ” “ Very well , let u go. ” “ And he will be very , very glad to make your acquaintance . I have often talked to him of you at different time . I wa speaking of you yesterday . Let u go . So you knew the old woman ? So that ’ s it ! It is all turning out splendidly .... Oh , yes , Sofya Ivanovna ... ” “ Sofya Semyonovna , ” corrected Raskolnikov . “ Sofya Semyonovna , this is my friend Razumihin , and he is a good man. ” “ If you have to go now , ” Sonia wa beginning , not looking at Razumihin at all , and still more embarrassed . “ Let u go , ” decided Raskolnikov . “ I will come to you to-day , Sofya Semyonovna . Only tell me where you live. ” He wa not exactly ill at ease , but seemed hurried , and avoided her eye . Sonia gave her address , and flushed a she did so . They all went out together . “ Don ’ t you lock up ? ” asked Razumihin , following him on to the stair . “ Never , ” answered Raskolnikov . “ I have been meaning to buy a lock for these two year . People are happy who have no need of lock , ” he said , laughing , to Sonia . They stood still in the gateway . “ Do you go to the right , Sofya Semyonovna ? How did you find me , by the way ? ” he added , a though he wanted to say something quite different . He wanted to look at her soft clear eye , but this wa not easy . “ Why , you gave your address to Polenka yesterday. ” “ Polenka ? Oh , yes ; Polenka , that is the little girl . She is your sister ? Did I give her the address ? ” “ Why , had you forgotten ? ” “ No , I remember. ” “ I had heard my father speak of you ... only I did not know your name , and he did not know it . And now I came ... and a I had learnt your name , I asked to-day , ‘ Where doe Mr. Raskolnikov live ? ’ I did not know you had only a room too .... Good-bye , I will tell Katerina Ivanovna. ” She wa extremely glad to escape at last ; she went away looking down , hurrying to get out of sight a soon a possible , to walk the twenty step to the turning on the right and to be at last alone , and then moving rapidly along , looking at no one , noticing nothing , to think , to remember , to meditate on every word , every detail . Never , never had she felt anything like this . Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world wa opening before her . She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to come to her that day , perhaps at once ! “ Only not to-day , please , not to-day ! ” she kept muttering with a sinking heart , a though entreating someone , like a frightened child . “ Mercy ! to me ... to that room ... he will see ... oh , dear ! ” She wa not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who wa watching her and following at her heel . He had accompanied her from the gateway . At the moment when Razumihin , Raskolnikov , and she stood still at parting on the pavement , this gentleman , who wa just passing , started on hearing Sonia ’ s word : “ and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov lived ? ” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three , especially upon Raskolnikov , to whom Sonia wa speaking ; then looked back and noted the house . All this wa done in an instant a he passed , and trying not to betray his interest , he walked on more slowly a though waiting for something . He wa waiting for Sonia ; he saw that they were parting , and that Sonia wa going home . “ Home ? Where ? I ’ ve seen that face somewhere , ” he thought . “ I must find out. ” At the turning he crossed over , looked round , and saw Sonia coming the same way , noticing nothing . She turned the corner . He followed her on the other side . After about fifty pace he crossed over again , overtook her and kept two or three yard behind her . He wa a man about fifty , rather tall and thickly set , with broad high shoulder which made him look a though he stooped a little . He wore good and fashionable clothes , and looked like a gentleman of position . He carried a handsome cane , which he tapped on the pavement at each step ; his glove were spotless . He had a broad , rather pleasant face with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour , not often seen in Petersburg . His flaxen hair wa still abundant , and only touched here and there with grey , and his thick square beard wa even lighter than his hair . His eye were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look ; his lip were crimson . He wa a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger than his year . When Sonia came out on the canal bank , they were the only two person on the pavement . He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation . On reaching the house where she lodged , Sonia turned in at the gate ; he followed her , seeming rather surprised . In the courtyard she turned to the right corner . “ Bah ! ” muttered the unknown gentleman , and mounted the stair behind her . Only then Sonia noticed him . She reached the third storey , turned down the passage , and rang at No . 9 . On the door wa inscribed in chalk , “ Kapernaumov , Tailor. ” “ Bah ! ” the stranger repeated again , wondering at the strange coincidence , and he rang next door , at No . 8 . The door were two or three yard apart . “ You lodge at Kapernaumov ’ s , ” he said , looking at Sonia and laughing . “ He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday . I am staying close here at Madame Resslich ’ s . How odd ! ” Sonia looked at him attentively . “ We are neighbour , ” he went on gaily . “ I only came to town the day before yesterday . Good-bye for the present. ” Sonia made no reply ; the door opened and she slipped in . She felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy . * * * * * On the way to Porfiry ’ s , Razumihin wa obviously excited . “ That ’ s capital , brother , ” he repeated several time , “ and I am glad ! I am glad ! ” “ What are you glad about ? ” Raskolnikov thought to himself . “ I didn ’ t know that you pledged thing at the old woman ’ s , too . And ... wa it long ago ? I mean , wa it long since you were there ? ” “ What a simple-hearted fool he is ! ” “ When wa it ? ” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect . “ Two or three day before her death it must have been . But I am not going to redeem the thing now , ” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the thing . “ I ’ ve not more than a silver rouble left ... after last night ’ s accursed delirium ! ” He laid special emphasis on the delirium . “ Yes , yes , ” Razumihin hastened to agree -- with what wa not clear . “ Then that ’ s why you ... were stuck ... partly ... you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some ring or chain ! Yes , yes ... that ’ s clear , it ’ s all clear now. ” “ Hullo ! How that idea must have got about among them . Here this man will go to the stake for me , and I find him delighted at having it _cleared up_ why I spoke of ring in my delirium ! What a hold the idea must have on all of them ! ” “ Shall we find him ? ” he asked suddenly . “ Oh , yes , ” Razumihin answered quickly . “ He is a nice fellow , you will see , brother . Rather clumsy , that is to say , he is a man of polished manner , but I mean clumsy in a different sense . He is an intelligent fellow , very much so indeed , but he ha his own range of idea .... He is incredulous , sceptical , cynical ... he like to impose on people , or rather to make fun of them . His is the old , circumstantial method .... But he understands his work ... thoroughly .... Last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue . He is very , very anxious to make your acquaintance ! ” “ On what ground is he so anxious ? ” “ Oh , it ’ s not exactly ... you see , since you ’ ve been ill I happen to have mentioned you several time .... So , when he heard about you ... about your being a law student and not able to finish your study , he said , ‘ What a pity ! ’ And so I concluded ... from everything together , not only that ; yesterday Zametov ... you know , Rodya , I talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday , when I wa drunk ... I am afraid , brother , of your exaggerating it , you see. ” “ What ? That they think I am a madman ? Maybe they are right , ” he said with a constrained smile . “ Yes , yes .... That is , pooh , no ! ... But all that I said ( and there wa something else too ) it wa all nonsense , drunken nonsense. ” “ But why are you apologising ? I am so sick of it all ! ” Raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability . It wa partly assumed , however . “ I know , I know , I understand . Believe me , I understand . One ’ s ashamed to speak of it. ” “ If you are ashamed , then don ’ t speak of it. ” Both were silent . Razumihin wa more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion . He wa alarmed , too , by what Razumihin had just said about Porfiry . “ I shall have to pull a long face with him too , ” he thought , with a beating heart , and he turned white , “ and do it naturally , too . But the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all . Carefully do nothing at all ! No , _carefully_ would not be natural again .... Oh , well , we shall see how it turn out .... We shall see ... directly . Is it a good thing to go or not ? The butterfly fly to the light . My heart is beating , that ’ s what ’ s bad ! ” “ In this grey house , ” said Razumihin . “ The most important thing , doe Porfiry know that I wa at the old hag ’ s flat yesterday ... and asked about the blood ? I must find that out instantly , a soon a I go in , find out from his face ; otherwise ... I ’ ll find out , if it ’ s my ruin. ” “ I say , brother , ” he said suddenly , addressing Razumihin , with a sly smile , “ I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited . Isn ’ t it so ? ” “ Excited ? Not a bit of it , ” said Razumihin , stung to the quick . “ Yes , brother , I assure you it ’ s noticeable . Why , you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit , on the edge somehow , and you seemed to be writhing all the time . You kept jumping up for nothing . One moment you were angry , and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat . You even blushed ; especially when you were invited to dinner , you blushed awfully. ” “ Nothing of the sort , nonsense ! What do you mean ? ” “ But why are you wriggling out of it , like a schoolboy ? By Jove , there he ’ s blushing again. ” “ What a pig you are ! ” “ But why are you so shamefaced about it ? Romeo ! Stay , I ’ ll tell of you to-day . Ha-ha-ha ! I ’ ll make mother laugh , and someone else , too ... ” “ Listen , listen , listen , this is serious .... What next , you fiend ! ” Razumihin wa utterly overwhelmed , turning cold with horror . “ What will you tell them ? Come , brother ... foo ! what a pig you are ! ” “ You are like a summer rose . And if only you knew how it suit you ; a Romeo over six foot high ! And how you ’ ve washed to-day -- you cleaned your nail , I declare . Eh ? That ’ s something unheard of ! Why , I do believe you ’ ve got pomatum on your hair ! Bend down. ” “ Pig ! ” Raskolnikov laughed a though he could not restrain himself . So laughing , they entered Porfiry Petrovitch ’ s flat . This is what Raskolnikov wanted : from within they could be heard laughing a they came in , still guffawing in the passage . “ Not a word here or I ’ ll ... brain you ! ” Razumihin whispered furiously , seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder . CHAPTER V Raskolnikov wa already entering the room . He came in looking a though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again . Behind him Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward , shamefaced and red a a peony , with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression . His face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified Raskolnikov ’ s laughter . Raskolnikov , not waiting for an introduction , bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch , who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them . He held out his hand and shook hand , still apparently making desperate effort to subdue his mirth and utter a few word to introduce himself . But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again a though accidentally at Razumihin , and could no longer control himself : his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it . The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received this “ spontaneous ” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness . Razumihin strengthened this impression a though on purpose . “ Fool ! You fiend , ” he roared , waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on it . Everything wa sent flying and crashing . “ But why break chair , gentleman ? You know it ’ s a loss to the Crown , ” Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily . Raskolnikov wa still laughing , with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch ’ s , but anxious not to overdo it , awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it . Razumihin , completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass , gazed gloomily at the fragment , cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance , seeing nothing . Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and wa ready to go on laughing , but obviously looked for explanation . Zametov had been sitting in the corner , but he rose at the visitor ’ entrance and wa standing in expectation with a smile on his lip , though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment . Zametov ’ s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly . “ I ’ ve got to think of that , ” he thought . “ Excuse me , please , ” he began , affecting extreme embarrassment . “ Raskolnikov. ” “ Not at all , very pleasant to see you ... and how pleasantly you ’ ve come in .... Why , won ’ t he even say good-morning ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin . “ Upon my honour I don ’ t know why he is in such a rage with me . I only told him a we came along that he wa like Romeo ... and proved it . And that wa all , I think ! ” “ Pig ! ” ejaculated Razumihin , without turning round . “ There must have been very grave ground for it , if he is so furious at the word , ” Porfiry laughed . “ Oh , you sharp lawyer ! ... Damn you all ! ” snapped Razumihin , and suddenly bursting out laughing himself , he went up to Porfiry with a more cheerful face a though nothing had happened . “ That ’ ll do ! We are all fool . To come to business . This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov ; in the first place he ha heard of you and want to make your acquaintance , and secondly , he ha a little matter of business with you . Bah ! Zametov , what brought you here ? Have you met before ? Have you known each other long ? ” “ What doe this mean ? ” thought Raskolnikov uneasily . Zametov seemed taken aback , but not very much so . “ Why , it wa at your room we met yesterday , ” he said easily . “ Then I have been spared the trouble . All last week he wa begging me to introduce him to you . Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me . Where is your tobacco ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch wa wearing a dressing-gown , very clean linen , and trodden-down slipper . He wa a man of about five and thirty , short , stout even to corpulence , and clean shaven . He wore his hair cut short and had a large round head , particularly prominent at the back . His soft , round , rather snub-nosed face wa of a sickly yellowish colour , but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression . It would have been good-natured except for a look in the eye , which shone with a watery , mawkish light under almost white , blinking eyelash . The expression of those eye wa strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure , and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight . As soon a Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him , he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end , waiting for him to explain his business , with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing , especially to a stranger , and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity . But in brief and coherent phrase Raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly , and wa so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry . Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eye off him . Razumihin , sitting opposite at the same table , listened warmly and impatiently , looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest . “ Fool , ” Raskolnikov swore to himself . “ You have to give information to the police , ” Porfiry replied , with a most businesslike air , “ that having learnt of this incident , that is of the murder , you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such thing belong to you , and that you desire to redeem them ... or ... but they will write to you. ” “ That ’ s just the point , that at the present moment , ” Raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment , “ I am not quite in fund ... and even this trifling sum is beyond me ... I only wanted , you see , for the present to declare that the thing are mine , and that when I have money .... ” “ That ’ s no matter , ” answered Porfiry Petrovitch , receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly , “ but you can , if you prefer , write straight to me , to say , that having been informed of the matter , and claiming such and such a your property , you beg ... ” “ On an ordinary sheet of paper ? ” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly , again interested in the financial side of the question . “ Oh , the most ordinary , ” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him , screwing up his eye and , a it were , winking at him . But perhaps it wa Raskolnikov ’ s fancy , for it all lasted but a moment . There wa certainly something of the sort , Raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him , goodness know why . “ He know , ” flashed through his mind like lightning . “ Forgive my troubling you about such trifle , ” he went on , a little disconcerted , “ the thing are only worth five rouble , but I prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me , and I must confess that I wa alarmed when I heard ... ” “ That ’ s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that Porfiry wa inquiring for everyone who had pledge ! ” Razumihin put in with obvious intention . This wa really unbearable . Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eye , but immediately recollected himself . “ You seem to be jeering at me , brother ? ” he said to him , with a well-feigned irritability . “ I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash ; but you mustn ’ t think me selfish or grasping for that , and these two thing may be anything but trash in my eye . I told you just now that the silver watch , though it ’ s not worth a cent , is the only thing left u of my father ’ s . You may laugh at me , but my mother is here , ” he turned suddenly to Porfiry , “ and if she knew , ” he turned again hurriedly to Razumihin , carefully making his voice tremble , “ that the watch wa lost , she would be in despair ! You know what woman are ! ” “ Not a bit of it ! I didn ’ t mean that at all ! Quite the contrary ! ” shouted Razumihin distressed . “ Was it right ? Was it natural ? Did I overdo it ? ” Raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor . “ Why did I say that about woman ? ” “ Oh , your mother is with you ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired . “ Yes. ” “ When did she come ? ” “ Last night. ” Porfiry paused a though reflecting . “ Your thing would not in any case be lost , ” he went on calmly and coldly . “ I have been expecting you here for some time. ” And a though that wa a matter of no importance , he carefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin , who wa ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet . Raskolnikov shuddered , but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him , and wa still concerned with Razumihin ’ s cigarette . “ What ? Expecting him ? Why , did you know that he had pledge _there_ ? ” cried Razumihin . Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov . “ Your thing , the ring and the watch , were wrapped up together , and on the paper your name wa legibly written in pencil , together with the date on which you left them with her ... ” “ How observant you are ! ” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly , doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face , but he failed , and suddenly added : “ I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledge ... that it must be difficult to remember them all .... But you remember them all so clearly , and ... and ... ” “ Stupid ! Feeble ! ” he thought . “ Why did I add that ? ” “ But we know all who had pledge , and you are the only one who hasn ’ t come forward , ” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony . “ I haven ’ t been quite well. ” “ I heard that too . I heard , indeed , that you were in great distress about something . You look pale still. ” “ I am not pale at all .... No , I am quite well , ” Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily , completely changing his tone . His anger wa mounting , he could not repress it . “ And in my anger I shall betray myself , ” flashed through his mind again . “ Why are they torturing me ? ” “ Not quite well ! ” Razumihin caught him up . “ What next ! He wa unconscious and delirious all yesterday . Would you believe , Porfiry , a soon a our back were turned , he dressed , though he could hardly stand , and gave u the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight , delirious all the time ! Would you believe it ! Extraordinary ! ” “ Really delirious ? You don ’ t say so ! ” Porfiry shook his head in a womanish way . “ Nonsense ! Don ’ t you believe it ! But you don ’ t believe it anyway , ” Raskolnikov let slip in his anger . But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange word . “ But how could you have gone out if you hadn ’ t been delirious ? ” Razumihin got hot suddenly . “ What did you go out for ? What wa the object of it ? And why on the sly ? Were you in your sens when you did it ? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly. ” “ I wa awfully sick of them yesterday. ” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance , “ I ran away from them to take lodging where they wouldn ’ t find me , and took a lot of money with me . Mr. Zametov there saw it . I say , Mr. Zametov , wa I sensible or delirious yesterday ; settle our dispute. ” He could have strangled Zametov at that moment , so hateful were his expression and his silence to him . “ In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully , but you were extremely irritable , ” Zametov pronounced dryly . “ And Nikodim Fomitch wa telling me to-day , ” put in Porfiry Petrovitch , “ that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over. ” “ And there , ” said Razumihin , “ weren ’ t you mad then ? You gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral . If you wanted to help , give fifteen or twenty even , but keep three rouble for yourself at least , but he flung away all the twenty-five at once ! ” “ Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it ? So that ’ s why I wa liberal yesterday .... Mr. Zametov know I ’ ve found a treasure ! Excuse u , please , for disturbing you for half an hour with such triviality , ” he said , turning to Porfiry Petrovitch , with trembling lip . “ We are boring you , aren ’ t we ? ” “ Oh no , quite the contrary , quite the contrary ! If only you knew how you interest me ! It ’ s interesting to look on and listen ... and I am really glad you have come forward at last. ” “ But you might give u some tea ! My throat ’ s dry , ” cried Razumihin . “ Capital idea ! Perhaps we will all keep you company . Wouldn ’ t you like ... something more essential before tea ? ” “ Get along with you ! ” Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea . Raskolnikov ’ s thought were in a whirl . He wa in terrible exasperation . “ The worst of it is they don ’ t disguise it ; they don ’ t care to stand on ceremony ! And how if you didn ’ t know me at all , did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me ? So they don ’ t care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dog . They simply spit in my face. ” He wa shaking with rage . “ Come , strike me openly , don ’ t play with me like a cat with a mouse . It ’ s hardly civil , Porfiry Petrovitch , but perhaps I won ’ t allow it ! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly face , and you ’ ll see how I despise you. ” He could hardly breathe . “ And what if it ’ s only my fancy ? What if I am mistaken , and through inexperience I get angry and don ’ t keep up my nasty part ? Perhaps it ’ s all unintentional . All their phrase are the usual one , but there is something about them .... It all might be said , but there is something . Why did he say bluntly , ‘ With her ’ ? Why did Zametov add that I spoke artfully ? Why do they speak in that tone ? Yes , the tone .... Razumihin is sitting here , why doe he see nothing ? That innocent blockhead never doe see anything ! Feverish again ! Did Porfiry wink at me just now ? Of course it ’ s nonsense ! What could he wink for ? Are they trying to upset my nerve or are they teasing me ? Either it ’ s ill fancy or they know ! Even Zametov is rude .... Is Zametov rude ? Zametov ha changed his mind . I foresaw he would change his mind ! He is at home here , while it ’ s my first visit . Porfiry doe not consider him a visitor ; sits with his back to him . They ’ re a thick a thief , no doubt , over me ! Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came . Do they know about the flat ? If only they ’ d make haste ! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it pas .... I put that in cleverly about a flat , it may be of use afterwards .... Delirious , indeed ... ha-ha-ha ! He know all about last night ! He didn ’ t know of my mother ’ s arrival ! The hag had written the date on in pencil ! You are wrong , you won ’ t catch me ! There are no fact ... it ’ s all supposition ! You produce fact ! The flat even isn ’ t a fact but delirium . I know what to say to them .... Do they know about the flat ? I won ’ t go without finding out . What did I come for ? But my being angry now , maybe is a fact ! Fool , how irritable I am ! Perhaps that ’ s right ; to play the invalid .... He is feeling me . He will try to catch me . Why did I come ? ” All this flashed like lightning through his mind . Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly . He became suddenly more jovial . “ Your party yesterday , brother , ha left my head rather .... And I am out of sort altogether , ” he began in quite a different tone , laughing to Razumihin . “ Was it interesting ? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point . Who got the best of it ? ” “ Oh , no one , of course . They got on to everlasting question , floated off into space. ” “ Only fancy , Rodya , what we got on to yesterday . Whether there is such a thing a crime . I told you that we talked our head off. ” “ What is there strange ? It ’ s an everyday social question , ” Raskolnikov answered casually . “ The question wasn ’ t put quite like that , ” observed Porfiry . “ Not quite , that ’ s true , ” Razumihin agreed at once , getting warm and hurried a usual . “ Listen , Rodion , and tell u your opinion , I want to hear it . I wa fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me . I told them you were coming .... It began with the socialist doctrine . You know their doctrine ; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more , and nothing more ; no other cause admitted ! ... ” “ You are wrong there , ” cried Porfiry Petrovitch ; he wa noticeably animated and kept laughing a he looked at Razumihin , which made him more excited than ever . “ Nothing is admitted , ” Razumihin interrupted with heat . “ I am not wrong . I ’ ll show you their pamphlet . Everything with them is ‘ the influence of environment , ’ and nothing else . Their favourite phrase ! From which it follows that , if society is normally organised , all crime will cease at once , since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant . Human nature is not taken into account , it is excluded , it ’ s not supposed to exist ! They don ’ t recognise that humanity , developing by a historical living process , will become at last a normal society , but they believe that a social system that ha come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant , quicker than any living process ! That ’ s why they instinctively dislike history , ‘ nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it , ’ and they explain it all a stupidity ! That ’ s why they so dislike the _living_ process of life ; they don ’ t want a _living soul_ ! The living soul demand life , the soul won ’ t obey the rule of mechanic , the soul is an object of suspicion , the soul is retrograde ! But what they want though it smell of death and can be made of India-rubber , at least is not alive , ha no will , is servile and won ’ t revolt ! And it come in the end to their reducing everything to the building of wall and the planning of room and passage in a phalanstery ! The phalanstery is ready , indeed , but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery -- it want life , it hasn ’ t completed it vital process , it ’ s too soon for the graveyard ! You can ’ t skip over nature by logic . Logic presupposes three possibility , but there are million ! Cut away a million , and reduce it all to the question of comfort ! That ’ s the easiest solution of the problem ! It ’ s seductively clear and you musn ’ t think about it . That ’ s the great thing , you mustn ’ t think ! The whole secret of life in two page of print ! ” “ Now he is off , beating the drum ! Catch hold of him , do ! ” laughed Porfiry . “ Can you imagine , ” he turned to Raskolnikov , “ six people holding forth like that last night , in one room , with punch a a preliminary ! No , brother , you are wrong , environment account for a great deal in crime ; I can assure you of that. ” “ Oh , I know it doe , but just tell me : a man of forty violates a child of ten ; wa it environment drove him to it ? ” “ Well , strictly speaking , it did , ” Porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity ; “ a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment. ” Razumihin wa almost in a frenzy . “ Oh , if you like , ” he roared . “ I ’ ll prove to you that your white eyelash may very well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great ’ s being two hundred and fifty foot high , and I will prove it clearly , exactly , progressively , and even with a Liberal tendency ! I undertake to ! Will you bet on it ? ” “ Done ! Let ’ s hear , please , how he will prove it ! ” “ He is always humbugging , confound him , ” cried Razumihin , jumping up and gesticulating . “ What ’ s the use of talking to you ? He doe all that on purpose ; you don ’ t know him , Rodion ! He took their side yesterday , simply to make fool of them . And the thing he said yesterday ! And they were delighted ! He can keep it up for a fortnight together . Last year he persuaded u that he wa going into a monastery : he stuck to it for two month . Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he wa going to get married , that he had everything ready for the wedding . He ordered new clothes indeed . We all began to congratulate him . There wa no bride , nothing , all pure fantasy ! ” “ Ah , you are wrong ! I got the clothes before . It wa the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in. ” “ Are you such a good dissembler ? ” Raskolnikov asked carelessly . “ You wouldn ’ t have supposed it , eh ? Wait a bit , I shall take you in , too . Ha-ha-ha ! No , I ’ ll tell you the truth . All these question about crime , environment , child , recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time . ‘ On Crime ’ ... or something of the sort , I forget the title , I read it with pleasure two month ago in the _Periodical Review_. ” “ My article ? In the _Periodical Review_ ? ” Raskolnikov asked in astonishment . “ I certainly did write an article upon a book six month ago when I left the university , but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_. ” “ But it came out in the _Periodical_. ” “ And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist , so that ’ s why it wasn ’ t printed at the time. ” “ That ’ s true ; but when it ceased to exist , the _Weekly Review_ wa amalgamated with the _Periodical_ , and so your article appeared two month ago in the latter . Didn ’ t you know ? ” Raskolnikov had not known . “ Why , you might get some money out of them for the article ! What a strange person you are ! You lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matter that concern you directly . It ’ s a fact , I assure you. ” “ Bravo , Rodya ! I knew nothing about it either ! ” cried Razumihin . “ I ’ ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number . Two month ago ? What wa the date ? It doesn ’ t matter though , I will find it . Think of not telling u ! ” “ How did you find out that the article wa mine ? It ’ s only signed with an initial. ” “ I only learnt it by chance , the other day . Through the editor ; I know him .... I wa very much interested. ” “ I analysed , if I remember , the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime. ” “ Yes , and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness . Very , very original , but ... it wa not that part of your article that interested me so much , but an idea at the end of the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly . There is , if you recollect , a suggestion that there are certain person who can ... that is , not precisely are able to , but have a perfect right to commit breach of morality and crime , and that the law is not for them. ” Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea . “ What ? What do you mean ? A right to crime ? But not because of the influence of environment ? ” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even . “ No , not exactly because of it , ” answered Porfiry . “ In his article all men are divided into ‘ ordinary ’ and ‘ extraordinary. ’ Ordinary men have to live in submission , have no right to transgress the law , because , don ’ t you see , they are ordinary . But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way , just because they are extraordinary . That wa your idea , if I am not mistaken ? ” “ What do you mean ? That can ’ t be right ? ” Razumihin muttered in bewilderment . Raskolnikov smiled again . He saw the point at once , and knew where they wanted to drive him . He decided to take up the challenge . “ That wasn ’ t quite my contention , ” he began simply and modestly . “ Yet I admit that you have stated it almost correctly ; perhaps , if you like , perfectly so. ” ( It almost gave him pleasure to admit this . ) “ The only difference is that I don ’ t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breach of moral , a you call it . In fact , I doubt whether such an argument could be published . I simply hinted that an ‘ extraordinary ’ man ha the right ... that is not an official right , but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep ... certain obstacle , and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea ( sometimes , perhaps , of benefit to the whole of humanity ) . You say that my article isn ’ t definite ; I am ready to make it a clear a I can . Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to ; very well . I maintain that if the discovery of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the life of one , a dozen , a hundred , or more men , Newton would have had the right , would indeed have been in duty-bound ... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discovery known to the whole of humanity . But it doe not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market . Then , I remember , I maintain in my article that all ... well , legislator and leader of men , such a Lycurgus , Solon , Mahomet , Napoleon , and so on , were all without exception criminal , from the very fact that , making a new law , they transgressed the ancient one , handed down from their ancestor and held sacred by the people , and they did not stop short at bloodshed either , if that bloodshed -- often of innocent person fighting bravely in defence of ancient law -- were of use to their cause . It ’ s remarkable , in fact , that the majority , indeed , of these benefactor and leader of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage . In short , I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common , that is to say capable of giving some new word , must from their very nature be criminal -- more or le , of course . Otherwise it ’ s hard for them to get out of the common rut ; and to remain in the common rut is what they can ’ t submit to , from their very nature again , and to my mind they ought not , indeed , to submit to it . You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that . The same thing ha been printed and read a thousand time before . As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary , I acknowledge that it ’ s somewhat arbitrary , but I don ’ t insist upon exact number . I only believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law of nature into two category , inferior ( ordinary ) , that is , so to say , material that serf only to reproduce it kind , and men who have the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_ . There are , of course , innumerable sub-divisions , but the distinguishing feature of both category are fairly well marked . The first category , generally speaking , are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding ; they live under control and love to be controlled . To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled , because that ’ s their vocation , and there is nothing humiliating in it for them . The second category all transgress the law ; they are destroyer or disposed to destruction according to their capacity . The crime of these men are of course relative and varied ; for the most part they seek in very varied way the destruction of the present for the sake of the better . But if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood , he can , I maintain , find within himself , in his conscience , a sanction for wading through blood -- that depends on the idea and it dimension , note that . It ’ s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article ( you remember it began with the legal question ) . There ’ s no need for such anxiety , however ; the mass will scarcely ever admit this right , they punish them or hang them ( more or le ) , and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation . But the same mass set these criminal on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them ( more or le ) . The first category is always the man of the present , the second the man of the future . The first preserve the world and people it , the second move the world and lead it to it goal . Each class ha an equal right to exist . In fact , all have equal right with me -- and _vive la guerre éternelle_ -- till the New Jerusalem , of course ! ” “ Then you believe in the New Jerusalem , do you ? ” “ I do , ” Raskolnikov answered firmly ; a he said these word and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eye on one spot on the carpet . “ And ... and do you believe in God ? Excuse my curiosity. ” “ I do , ” repeated Raskolnikov , raising his eye to Porfiry . “ And ... do you believe in Lazarus ’ rising from the dead ? ” “ I ... I do . Why do you ask all this ? ” “ You believe it literally ? ” “ Literally. ” “ You don ’ t say so .... I asked from curiosity . Excuse me . But let u go back to the question ; they are not always executed . Some , on the contrary ... ” “ Triumph in their lifetime ? Oh , yes , some attain their end in this life , and then ... ” “ They begin executing other people ? ” “ If it ’ s necessary ; indeed , for the most part they do . Your remark is very witty. ” “ Thank you . But tell me this : how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary one ? Are there sign at their birth ? I feel there ought to be more exactitude , more external definition . Excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen , but couldn ’ t they adopt a special uniform , for instance , couldn ’ t they wear something , be branded in some way ? For you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imago that he belongs to the other , begin to ‘ eliminate obstacle ’ a you so happily expressed it , then ... ” “ Oh , that very often happens ! That remark is wittier than the other. ” “ Thank you. ” “ No reason to ; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category , that is among the ordinary people ( a I perhaps unfortunately called them ) . In spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them , through a playfulness of nature , sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow , like to imagine themselves advanced people , ‘ destroyer , ’ and to push themselves into the ‘ new movement , ’ and this quite sincerely . Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often unobserved by them , or even despised a reactionary of grovelling tendency . But I don ’ t think there is any considerable danger here , and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far . Of course , they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place , but no more ; in fact , even this isn ’ t necessary a they castigate themselves , for they are very conscientious : some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hand .... They will impose various public act of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect ; in fact you ’ ve nothing to be uneasy about .... It ’ s a law of nature. ” “ Well , you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score ; but there ’ s another thing worry me . Tell me , please , are there many people who have the right to kill others , these extraordinary people ? I am ready to bow down to them , of course , but you must admit it ’ s alarming if there are a great many of them , eh ? ” “ Oh , you needn ’ t worry about that either , ” Raskolnikov went on in the same tone . “ People with new idea , people with the faintest capacity for saying something _new_ , are extremely few in number , extraordinarily so in fact . One thing only is clear , that the appearance of all these grade and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature . That law , of course , is unknown at present , but I am convinced that it exists , and one day may become known . The vast mass of mankind is mere material , and only exists in order by some great effort , by some mysterious process , by mean of some crossing of race and stock , to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence . One in ten thousand perhaps -- I speak roughly , approximately -- is born with some independence , and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand . The man of genius is one of million , and the great genius , the crown of humanity , appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand million . In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this take place . But there certainly is and must be a definite law , it can not be a matter of chance. ” “ Why , are you both joking ? ” Razumihin cried at last . “ There you sit , making fun of one another . Are you serious , Rodya ? ” Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply . And the unconcealed , persistent , nervous , and _discourteous_ sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face . “ Well , brother , if you are really serious ... You are right , of course , in saying that it ’ s not new , that it ’ s like what we ’ ve read and heard a thousand time already ; but what is really original in all this , and is exclusively your own , to my horror , is that you sanction bloodshed _in the name of conscience_ , and , excuse my saying so , with such fanaticism .... That , I take it , is the point of your article . But that sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind ... more terrible than the official , legal sanction of bloodshed .... ” “ You are quite right , it is more terrible , ” Porfiry agreed . “ Yes , you must have exaggerated ! There is some mistake , I shall read it . You can ’ t think that ! I shall read it. ” “ All that is not in the article , there ’ s only a hint of it , ” said Raskolnikov . “ Yes , yes. ” Porfiry couldn ’ t sit still . “ Your attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now , but ... excuse me for my impertinence ( I am really ashamed to be worrying you like this ) , you see , you ’ ve removed my anxiety a to the two grade getting mixed , but ... there are various practical possibility that make me uneasy ! What if some man or youth imago that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet -- a future one of course -- and suppose he begin to remove all obstacle .... He ha some great enterprise before him and need money for it ... and try to get it ... do you see ? ” Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner . Raskolnikov did not even raise his eye to him . “ I must admit , ” he went on calmly , “ that such case certainly must arise . The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare ; young people especially. ” “ Yes , you see . Well then ? ” “ What then ? ” Raskolnikov smiled in reply ; “ that ’ s not my fault . So it is and so it always will be . He said just now ( he nodded at Razumihin ) that I sanction bloodshed . Society is too well protected by prison , banishment , criminal investigator , penal servitude . There ’ s no need to be uneasy . You have but to catch the thief. ” “ And what if we do catch him ? ” “ Then he get what he deserves. ” “ You are certainly logical . But what of his conscience ? ” “ Why do you care about that ? ” “ Simply from humanity. ” “ If he ha a conscience he will suffer for his mistake . That will be his punishment -- a well a the prison. ” “ But the real genius , ” asked Razumihin frowning , “ those who have the right to murder ? Oughtn ’ t they to suffer at all even for the blood they ’ ve shed ? ” “ Why the word _ought_ ? It ’ s not a matter of permission or prohibition . He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim . Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart . The really great men must , I think , have great sadness on earth , ” he added dreamily , not in the tone of the conversation . He raised his eye , looked earnestly at them all , smiled , and took his cap . He wa too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance , and he felt this . Everyone got up . “ Well , you may abuse me , be angry with me if you like , ” Porfiry Petrovitch began again , “ but I can ’ t resist . Allow me one little question ( I know I am troubling you ) . There is just one little notion I want to express , simply that I may not forget it. ” “ Very good , tell me your little notion , ” Raskolnikov stood waiting , pale and grave before him . “ Well , you see ... I really don ’ t know how to express it properly .... It ’ s a playful , psychological idea .... When you were writing your article , surely you couldn ’ t have helped , he-he ! fancying yourself ... just a little , an ‘ extraordinary ’ man , uttering a _new word_ in your sense .... That ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? ” “ Quite possibly , ” Raskolnikov answered contemptuously . Razumihin made a movement . “ And , if so , could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulty and hardship or for some service to humanity -- to overstep obstacle ? ... For instance , to rob and murder ? ” And again he winked with his left eye , and laughed noiselessly just a before . “ If I did I certainly should not tell you , ” Raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt . “ No , I wa only interested on account of your article , from a literary point of view ... ” “ Foo ! how obvious and insolent that is ! ” Raskolnikov thought with repulsion . “ Allow me to observe , ” he answered dryly , “ that I don ’ t consider myself a Mahomet or a Napoleon , nor any personage of that kind , and not being one of them I can not tell you how I should act. ” “ Oh , come , don ’ t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity . Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice . “ Perhaps it wa one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona Ivanovna last week ? ” Zametov blurted out from the corner . Raskolnikov did not speak , but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry . Razumihin wa scowling gloomily . He seemed before this to be noticing something . He looked angrily around . There wa a minute of gloomy silence . Raskolnikov turned to go . “ Are you going already ? ” Porfiry said amiably , holding out his hand with excessive politeness . “ Very , very glad of your acquaintance . As for your request , have no uneasiness , write just a I told you , or , better still , come to me there yourself in a day or two ... to-morrow , indeed . I shall be there at eleven o ’ clock for certain . We ’ ll arrange it all ; we ’ ll have a talk . As one of the last to be _there_ , you might perhaps be able to tell u something , ” he added with a most good-natured expression . “ You want to cross-examine me officially in due form ? ” Raskolnikov asked sharply . “ Oh , why ? That ’ s not necessary for the present . You misunderstand me . I lose no opportunity , you see , and ... I ’ ve talked with all who had pledge .... I obtained evidence from some of them , and you are the last .... Yes , by the way , ” he cried , seemingly suddenly delighted , “ I just remember , what wa I thinking of ? ” he turned to Razumihin , “ you were talking my ear off about that Nikolay ... of course , I know , I know very well , ” he turned to Raskolnikov , “ that the fellow is innocent , but what is one to do ? We had to trouble Dmitri too .... This is the point , this is all : when you went up the stair it wa past seven , wasn ’ t it ? ” “ Yes , ” answered Raskolnikov , with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it . “ Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight , didn ’ t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey , do you remember ? two workman or at least one of them ? They were painting there , didn ’ t you notice them ? It ’ s very , very important for them. ” “ Painters ? No , I didn ’ t see them , ” Raskolnikov answered slowly , a though ransacking his memory , while at the same instant he wa racking every nerve , almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture a quickly a possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything . “ No , I didn ’ t see them , and I don ’ t think I noticed a flat like that open .... But on the fourth storey ” ( he had mastered the trap now and wa triumphant ) “ I remember now that someone wa moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna ’ s .... I remember ... I remember it clearly . Some porter were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall . But painter ... no , I don ’ t remember that there were any painter , and I don ’ t think that there wa a flat open anywhere , no , there wasn ’ t. ” “ What do you mean ? ” Razumihin shouted suddenly , a though he had reflected and realised . “ Why , it wa on the day of the murder the painter were at work , and he wa there three day before ? What are you asking ? ” “ Foo ! I have muddled it ! ” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead . “ Deuce take it ! This business is turning my brain ! ” he addressed Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically . “ It would be such a great thing for u to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat , so I fancied you could perhaps have told u something .... I quite muddled it. ” “ Then you should be more careful , ” Razumihin observed grimly . The last word were uttered in the passage . Porfiry Petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness . They went out into the street gloomy and sullen , and for some step they did not say a word . Raskolnikov drew a deep breath . CHAPTER VI “ I don ’ t believe it , I can ’ t believe it ! ” repeated Razumihin , trying in perplexity to refute Raskolnikov ’ s argument . They were by now approaching Bakaleyev ’ s lodging , where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while . Razumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion , confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about _it_ . “ Don ’ t believe it , then ! ” answered Raskolnikov , with a cold , careless smile . “ You were noticing nothing a usual , but I wa weighing every word. ” “ You are suspicious . That is why you weighed their word ... h ’ m ... certainly , I agree , Porfiry ’ s tone wa rather strange , and still more that wretch Zametov ! ... You are right , there wa something about him -- but why ? Why ? ” “ He ha changed his mind since last night. ” “ Quite the contrary ! If they had that brainless idea , they would do their utmost to hide it , and conceal their card , so a to catch you afterwards .... But it wa all impudent and careless. ” “ If they had had fact -- I mean , real fact -- or at least ground for suspicion , then they would certainly have tried to hide their game , in the hope of getting more ( they would have made a search long ago besides ) . But they have no fact , not one . It is all mirage -- all ambiguous . Simply a floating idea . So they try to throw me out by impudence . And perhaps , he wa irritated at having no fact , and blurted it out in his vexation -- or perhaps he ha some plan ... he seems an intelligent man . Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know . They have a psychology of their own , brother . But it is loathsome explaining it all . Stop ! ” “ And it ’ s insulting , insulting ! I understand you . But ... since we have spoken openly now ( and it is an excellent thing that we have at last -- I am glad ) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago , this idea . Of course the merest hint only -- an insinuation -- but why an insinuation even ? How dare they ? What foundation have they ? If only you knew how furious I have been . Think only ! Simply because a poor student , unhinged by poverty and hypochondria , on the eve of a severe delirious illness ( note that ) , suspicious , vain , proud , who ha not seen a soul to speak to for six month , in rag and in boot without sol , ha to face some wretched policeman and put up with their insolence ; and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose , the I.O.U . presented by Tchebarov , the new paint , thirty degree Reaumur and a stifling atmosphere , a crowd of people , the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before , and all that on an empty stomach -- he might well have a fainting fit ! And that , that is what they found it all on ! Damn them ! I understand how annoying it is , but in your place , Rodya , I would laugh at them , or better still , spit in their ugly face , and spit a dozen time in all direction . I ’ d hit out in all direction , neatly too , and so I ’ d put an end to it . Damn them ! Don ’ t be downhearted . It ’ s a shame ! ” “ He really ha put it well , though , ” Raskolnikov thought . “ Damn them ? But the cross-examination again , to-morrow ? ” he said with bitterness . “ Must I really enter into explanation with them ? I feel vexed a it is , that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the restaurant .... ” “ Damn it ! I will go myself to Porfiry . I will squeeze it out of him , a one of the family : he must let me know the in and out of it all ! And a for Zametov ... ” “ At last he see through him ! ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Stay ! ” cried Razumihin , seizing him by the shoulder again . “ Stay ! you were wrong . I have thought it out . You are wrong ! How wa that a trap ? You say that the question about the workman wa a trap . But if you had done _that_ , could you have said you had seen them painting the flat ... and the workman ? On the contrary , you would have seen nothing , even if you had seen it . Who would own it against himself ? ” “ If I had done _that thing_ , I should certainly have said that I had seen the workman and the flat , ” Raskolnikov answered , with reluctance and obvious disgust . “ But why speak against yourself ? ” “ Because only peasant , or the most inexperienced novice deny everything flatly at examination . If a man is ever so little developed and experienced , he will certainly try to admit all the external fact that can ’ t be avoided , but will seek other explanation of them , will introduce some special , unexpected turn , that will give them another significance and put them in another light . Porfiry might well reckon that I should be sure to answer so , and say I had seen them to give an air of truth , and then make some explanation. ” “ But he would have told you at once that the workman could not have been there two day before , and that therefore you must have been there on the day of the murder at eight o ’ clock . And so he would have caught you over a detail. ” “ Yes , that is what he wa reckoning on , that I should not have time to reflect , and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer , and so would forget that the workman could not have been there two day before. ” “ But how could you forget it ? ” “ Nothing easier . It is in just such stupid thing clever people are most easily caught . The more cunning a man is , the le he suspect that he will be caught in a simple thing . The more cunning a man is , the simpler the trap he must be caught in . Porfiry is not such a fool a you think .... ” “ He is a knave then , if that is so ! ” Raskolnikov could not help laughing . But at the very moment , he wa struck by the strangeness of his own frankness , and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation , though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion , obviously with a motive , from necessity . “ I am getting a relish for certain aspect ! ” he thought to himself . But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy , a though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him . His uneasiness kept on increasing . They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev ’ s . “ Go in alone ! ” said Raskolnikov suddenly . “ I will be back directly. ” “ Where are you going ? Why , we are just here. ” “ I can ’ t help it .... I will come in half an hour . Tell them. ” “ Say what you like , I will come with you. ” “ You , too , want to torture me ! ” he screamed , with such bitter irritation , such despair in his eye that Razumihin ’ s hand dropped . He stood for some time on the step , looking gloomily at Raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging . At last , gritting his teeth and clenching his fist , he swore he would squeeze Porfiry like a lemon that very day , and went up the stair to reassure Pulcheria Alexandrovna , who wa by now alarmed at their long absence . When Raskolnikov got home , his hair wa soaked with sweat and he wa breathing heavily . He went rapidly up the stair , walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch . Then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner , to that hole under the paper where he had put the thing ; put his hand in , and for some minute felt carefully in the hole , in every crack and fold of the paper . Finding nothing , he got up and drew a deep breath . As he wa reaching the step of Bakaleyev ’ s , he suddenly fancied that something , a chain , a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman ’ s handwriting on it , might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack , and then might suddenly turn up a unexpected , conclusive evidence against him . He stood a though lost in thought , and a strange , humiliated , half senseless smile strayed on his lip . He took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room . His idea were all tangled . He went dreamily through the gateway . “ Here he is himself , ” shouted a loud voice . He raised his head . The porter wa standing at the door of his little room and wa pointing him out to a short man who looked like an artisan , wearing a long coat and a waistcoat , and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman . He stooped , and his head in a greasy cap hung forward . From his wrinkled flabby face he looked over fifty ; his little eye were lost in fat and they looked out grimly , sternly and discontentedly . “ What is it ? ” Raskolnikov asked , going up to the porter . The man stole a look at him from under his brow and he looked at him attentively , deliberately ; then he turned slowly and went out of the gate into the street without saying a word . “ What is it ? ” cried Raskolnikov . “ Why , he there wa asking whether a student lived here , mentioned your name and whom you lodged with . I saw you coming and pointed you out and he went away . It ’ s funny. ” The porter too seemed rather puzzled , but not much so , and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room . Raskolnikov ran after the stranger , and at once caught sight of him walking along the other side of the street with the same even , deliberate step with his eye fixed on the ground , a though in meditation . He soon overtook him , but for some time walked behind him . At last , moving on to a level with him , he looked at his face . The man noticed him at once , looked at him quickly , but dropped his eye again ; and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word . “ You were inquiring for me ... of the porter ? ” Raskolnikov said at last , but in a curiously quiet voice . The man made no answer ; he didn ’ t even look at him . Again they were both silent . “ Why do you ... come and ask for me ... and say nothing .... What ’ s the meaning of it ? ” Raskolnikov ’ s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the word clearly . The man raised his eye this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at Raskolnikov . “ Murderer ! ” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice . Raskolnikov went on walking beside him . His leg felt suddenly weak , a cold shiver ran down his spine , and his heart seemed to stand still for a moment , then suddenly began throbbing a though it were set free . So they walked for about a hundred pace , side by side in silence . The man did not look at him . “ What do you mean ... what is .... Who is a murderer ? ” muttered Raskolnikov hardly audibly . “ _You_ are a murderer , ” the man answered still more articulately and emphatically , with a smile of triumphant hatred , and again he looked straight into Raskolnikov ’ s pale face and stricken eye . They had just reached the cross-roads . The man turned to the left without looking behind him . Raskolnikov remained standing , gazing after him . He saw him turn round fifty pace away and look back at him still standing there . Raskolnikov could not see clearly , but he fancied that he wa again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph . With slow faltering step , with shaking knee , Raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret , feeling chilled all over . He took off his cap and put it on the table , and for ten minute he stood without moving . Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it . So he lay for half an hour . He thought of nothing . Some thought or fragment of thought , some image without order or coherence floated before his mind -- face of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once , whom he would never have recalled , the belfry of the church at V. , the billiard table in a restaurant and some officer playing billiards , the smell of cigar in some underground tobacco shop , a tavern room , a back staircase quite dark , all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells , and the Sunday bell floating in from somewhere .... The image followed one another , whirling like a hurricane . Some of them he liked and tried to clutch at , but they faded and all the while there wa an oppression within him , but it wa not overwhelming , sometimes it wa even pleasant .... The slight shivering still persisted , but that too wa an almost pleasant sensation . He heard the hurried footstep of Razumihin ; he closed his eye and pretended to be asleep . Razumihin opened the door and stood for some time in the doorway a though hesitating , then he stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa . Raskolnikov heard Nastasya ’ s whisper : “ Don ’ t disturb him ! Let him sleep . He can have his dinner later. ” “ Quite so , ” answered Razumihin . Both withdrew carefully and closed the door . Another half-hour passed . Raskolnikov opened his eye , turned on his back again , clasping his hand behind his head . “ Who is he ? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth ? Where wa he , what did he see ? He ha seen it all , that ’ s clear . Where wa he then ? And from where did he see ? Why ha he only now sprung out of the earth ? And how could he see ? Is it possible ? Hm ... ” continued Raskolnikov , turning cold and shivering , “ and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the door -- wa that possible ? A clue ? You miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence ! A fly flew by and saw it ! Is it possible ? ” He felt with sudden loathing how weak , how physically weak he had become . “ I ought to have known it , ” he thought with a bitter smile . “ And how dared I , knowing myself , knowing how I should be , take up an axe and shed blood ! I ought to have known beforehand .... Ah , but I did know ! ” he whispered in despair . At time he came to a standstill at some thought . “ No , those men are not made so . The real _Master_ to whom all is permitted storm Toulon , make a massacre in Paris , _forgets_ an army in Egypt , _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and get off with a jest at Vilna . And altar are set up to him after his death , and so _all_ is permitted . No , such people , it seems , are not of flesh but of bronze ! ” One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh . Napoleon , the pyramid , Waterloo , and a wretched skinny old woman , a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed -- it ’ s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest ! How can they digest it ! It ’ s too inartistic . “ A Napoleon creep under an old woman ’ s bed ! Ugh , how loathsome ! ” At moment he felt he wa raving . He sank into a state of feverish excitement . “ The old woman is of no consequence , ” he thought , hotly and incoherently . “ The old woman wa a mistake perhaps , but she is not what matter ! The old woman wa only an illness .... I wa in a hurry to overstep .... I didn ’ t kill a human being , but a principle ! I killed the principle , but I didn ’ t overstep , I stopped on this side .... I wa only capable of killing . And it seems I wasn ’ t even capable of that ... Principle ? Why wa that fool Razumihin abusing the socialist ? They are industrious , commercial people ; ‘ the happiness of all ’ is their case . No , life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again ; I don ’ t want to wait for ‘ the happiness of all. ’ I want to live myself , or else better not live at all . I simply couldn ’ t pas by my mother starving , keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the ‘ happiness of all. ’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of all and so my heart is at peace . Ha-ha ! Why have you let me slip ? I only live once , I too want .... Ech , I am an æsthetic louse and nothing more , ” he added suddenly , laughing like a madman . “ Yes , I am certainly a louse , ” he went on , clutching at the idea , gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure . “ In the first place , because I can reason that I am one , and secondly , because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence , calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lust did I undertake it , but with a grand and noble object -- ha-ha ! Thirdly , because I aimed at carrying it out a justly a possible , weighing , measuring and calculating . Of all the louse I picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only a much a I needed for the first step , no more nor le ( so the rest would have gone to a monastery , according to her will , ha-ha ! ) . And what show that I am utterly a louse , ” he added , grinding his teeth , “ is that I am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed , and _I felt beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her . Can anything be compared with the horror of that ? The vulgarity ! The abjectness ! I understand the ‘ prophet ’ with his sabre , on his steed : Allah command and ‘ trembling ’ creation must obey ! The ‘ prophet ’ is right , he is right when he set a battery across the street and blow up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain ! It ’ s for you to obey , trembling creation , and not _to have desires_ , for that ’ s not for you ! ... I shall never , never forgive the old woman ! ” His hair wa soaked with sweat , his quivering lip were parched , his eye were fixed on the ceiling . “ Mother , sister -- how I loved them ! Why do I hate them now ? Yes , I hate them , I feel a physical hatred for them , I can ’ t bear them near me .... I went up to my mother and kissed her , I remember .... To embrace her and think if she only knew ... shall I tell her then ? That ’ s just what I might do .... _She_ must be the same a I am , ” he added , straining himself to think , a it were struggling with delirium . “ Ah , how I hate the old woman now ! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life ! Poor Lizaveta ! Why did she come in ? ... It ’ s strange though , why is it I scarcely ever think of her , a though I hadn ’ t killed her ? Lizaveta ! Sonia ! Poor gentle thing , with gentle eye .... Dear woman ! Why don ’ t they weep ? Why don ’ t they moan ? They give up everything ... their eye are soft and gentle .... Sonia , Sonia ! Gentle Sonia ! ” He lost consciousness ; it seemed strange to him that he didn ’ t remember how he got into the street . It wa late evening . The twilight had fallen and the full moon wa shining more and more brightly ; but there wa a peculiar breathlessness in the air . There were crowd of people in the street ; workman and business people were making their way home ; other people had come out for a walk ; there wa a smell of mortar , dust and stagnant water . Raskolnikov walked along , mournful and anxious ; he wa distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose , of having to do something in a hurry , but what it wa he had forgotten . Suddenly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street , beckoning to him . He crossed over to him , but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging , a though he had made no sign to him . “ Stay , did he really beckon ? ” Raskolnikov wondered , but he tried to overtake him . When he wa within ten pace he recognised him and wa frightened ; it wa the same man with stooping shoulder in the long coat . Raskolnikov followed him at a distance ; his heart wa beating ; they went down a turning ; the man still did not look round . “ Does he know I am following him ? ” thought Raskolnikov . The man went into the gateway of a big house . Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him . In the court-yard the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him . Raskolnikov at once followed him into the yard , but the man wa gone . He must have gone up the first staircase . Raskolnikov rushed after him . He heard slow measured step two flight above . The staircase seemed strangely familiar . He reached the window on the first floor ; the moon shone through the pane with a melancholy and mysterious light ; then he reached the second floor . Bah ! this is the flat where the painter were at work ... but how wa it he did not recognise it at once ? The step of the man above had died away . “ So he must have stopped or hidden somewhere. ” He reached the third storey , should he go on ? There wa a stillness that wa dreadful .... But he went on . The sound of his own footstep scared and frightened him . How dark it wa ! The man must be hiding in some corner here . Ah ! the flat wa standing wide open , he hesitated and went in . It wa very dark and empty in the passage , a though everything had been removed ; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which wa flooded with moonlight . Everything there wa a before , the chair , the looking-glass , the yellow sofa and the picture in the frame . A huge , round , copper-red moon looked in at the window . “ It ’ s the moon that make it so still , weaving some mystery , ” thought Raskolnikov . He stood and waited , waited a long while , and the more silent the moonlight , the more violently his heart beat , till it wa painful . And still the same hush . Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all wa still again . A fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz . At that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall . “ Why is that cloak here ? ” he thought , “ it wasn ’ t there before .... ” He went up to it quietly and felt that there wa someone hiding behind it . He cautiously moved the cloak and saw , sitting on a chair in the corner , the old woman bent double so that he couldn ’ t see her face ; but it wa she . He stood over her . “ She is afraid , ” he thought . He stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow , then another on the skull . But strange to say she did not stir , a though she were made of wood . He wa frightened , bent down nearer and tried to look at her ; but she , too , bent her head lower . He bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below , he peeped and turned cold with horror : the old woman wa sitting and laughing , shaking with noiseless laughter , doing her utmost that he should not hear it . Suddenly he fancied that the door from the bedroom wa opened a little and that there wa laughter and whispering within . He wa overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force , but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman wa simply shaking with mirth . He wa rushing away , but the passage wa full of people , the door of the flat stood open and on the landing , on the stair and everywhere below there were people , row of head , all looking , but huddled together in silence and expectation . Something gripped his heart , his leg were rooted to the spot , they would not move .... He tried to scream and woke up . He drew a deep breath -- but his dream seemed strangely to persist : his door wa flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently . Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eye and he instantly closed them again . He lay on his back without stirring . “ Is it still a dream ? ” he wondered and again raised his eyelid hardly perceptibly ; the stranger wa standing in the same place , still watching him . He stepped cautiously into the room , carefully closing the door after him , went up to the table , paused a moment , still keeping his eye on Raskolnikov , and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa ; he put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hand on his cane and his chin on his hand . It wa evident that he wa prepared to wait indefinitely . As far a Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen glance , he wa a man no longer young , stout , with a full , fair , almost whitish beard . Ten minute passed . It wa still light , but beginning to get dusk . There wa complete stillness in the room . Not a sound came from the stair . Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane . It wa unbearable at last . Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa . “ Come , tell me what you want. ” “ I knew you were not asleep , but only pretending , ” the stranger answered oddly , laughing calmly . “ Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov , allow me to introduce myself .... ” PART IV CHAPTER I “ Can this be still a dream ? ” Raskolnikov thought once more . He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor . “ Svidrigaïlov ! What nonsense ! It can ’ t be ! ” he said at last aloud in bewilderment . His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation . “ I ’ ve come to you for two reason . In the first place , I wanted to make your personal acquaintance , a I have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering ; secondly , I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister , Avdotya Romanovna . For without your support she might not let me come near her now , for she is prejudiced against me , but with your assistance I reckon on ... ” “ You reckon wrongly , ” interrupted Raskolnikov . “ They only arrived yesterday , may I ask you ? ” Raskolnikov made no reply . “ It wa yesterday , I know . I only arrived myself the day before . Well , let me tell you this , Rodion Romanovitch , I don ’ t consider it necessary to justify myself , but kindly tell me what wa there particularly criminal on my part in all this business , speaking without prejudice , with common sense ? ” Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence . “ That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘ insulted her with my infamous proposal ’ -- is that it ? ( I am anticipating you . ) But you ’ ve only to assume that I , too , am a man _et nihil humanum_ ... in a word , that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love ( which doe not depend on our will ) , then everything can be explained in the most natural manner . The question is , am I a monster , or am I myself a victim ? And what if I am a victim ? In proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland , I may have cherished the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I wa promoting our mutual happiness ! Reason is the slave of passion , you know ; why , probably , I wa doing more harm to myself than anyone ! ” “ But that ’ s not the point , ” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust . “ It ’ s simply that whether you are right or wrong , we dislike you . We don ’ t want to have anything to do with you . We show you the door . Go out ! ” Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh . “ But you ’ re ... but there ’ s no getting round you , ” he said , laughing in the frankest way . “ I hoped to get round you , but you took up the right line at once ! ” “ But you are trying to get round me still ! ” “ What of it ? What of it ? ” cried Svidrigaïlov , laughing openly . “ But this is what the French call _bonne guerre_ , and the most innocent form of deception ! ... But still you have interrupted me ; one way or another , I repeat again : there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden . Marfa Petrovna ... ” “ You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna , too , so they say ? ” Raskolnikov interrupted rudely . “ Oh , you ’ ve heard that , too , then ? You ’ d be sure to , though .... But a for your question , I really don ’ t know what to say , though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score . Don ’ t suppose that I am in any apprehension about it . All wa regular and in order ; the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine , and indeed it could have proved nothing else . But I ’ ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late , on my way here in the train , especially : didn ’ t I contribute to all that ... calamity , morally , in a way , by irritation or something of the sort . But I came to the conclusion that that , too , wa quite out of the question. ” Raskolnikov laughed . “ I wonder you trouble yourself about it ! ” “ But what are you laughing at ? Only consider , I struck her just twice with a switch -- there were no mark even ... don ’ t regard me a a cynic , please ; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it wa of me and all that ; but I know for certain , too , that Marfa Petrovna wa very likely pleased at my , so to say , warmth . The story of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop ; for the last three day Marfa Petrovna had been forced to sit at home ; she had nothing to show herself with in the town . Besides , she had bored them so with that letter ( you heard about her reading the letter ) . And all of a sudden those two switch fell from heaven ! Her first act wa to order the carriage to be got out .... Not to speak of the fact that there are case when woman are very , very glad to be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation . There are instance of it with everyone ; human being in general , indeed , greatly love to be insulted , have you noticed that ? But it ’ s particularly so with woman . One might even say it ’ s their only amusement. ” At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview . But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment . “ You are fond of fighting ? ” he asked carelessly . “ No , not very , ” Svidrigaïlov answered , calmly . “ And Marfa Petrovna and I scarcely ever fought . We lived very harmoniously , and she wa always pleased with me . I only used the whip twice in all our seven year ( not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character ) . The first time , two month after our marriage , immediately after we arrived in the country , and the last time wa that of which we are speaking . Did you suppose I wa such a monster , such a reactionary , such a slave driver ? Ha , ha ! By the way , do you remember , Rodion Romanovitch , how a few year ago , in those day of beneficent publicity , a nobleman , I ’ ve forgotten his name , wa put to shame everywhere , in all the paper , for having thrashed a German woman in the railway train . You remember ? It wa in those day , that very year I believe , the ‘ disgraceful action of the _Age_ ’ took place ( you know , ‘ The Egyptian Nights , ’ that public reading , you remember ? The dark eye , you know ! Ah , the golden day of our youth , where are they ? ) . Well , a for the gentleman who thrashed the German , I feel no sympathy with him , because after all what need is there for sympathy ? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking ‘ Germans ’ that I don ’ t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself . No one looked at the subject from that point of view then , but that ’ s the truly humane point of view , I assure you. ” After saying this , Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again . Raskolnikov saw clearly that this wa a man with a firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself . “ I expect you ’ ve not talked to anyone for some day ? ” he asked . “ Scarcely anyone . I suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man ? ” “ No , I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man. ” “ Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your question ? Is that it ? But why take offence ? As you asked , so I answered , ” he replied , with a surprising expression of simplicity . “ You know , there ’ s hardly anything I take interest in , ” he went on , a it were dreamily , “ especially now , I ’ ve nothing to do .... You are quite at liberty to imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive , particularly a I told you I want to see your sister about something . But I ’ ll confess frankly , I am very much bored . The last three day especially , so I am delighted to see you .... Don ’ t be angry , Rodion Romanovitch , but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself . Say what you like , there ’ s something wrong with you , and now , too ... not this very minute , I mean , but now , generally .... Well , well , I won ’ t , I won ’ t , don ’ t scowl ! I am not such a bear , you know , a you think. ” Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him . “ You are not a bear , perhaps , at all , ” he said . “ I fancy indeed that you are a man of very good breeding , or at least know how on occasion to behave like one. ” “ I am not particularly interested in anyone ’ s opinion , ” Svidrigaïlov answered , dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness , “ and therefore why not be vulgar at time when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate ... and especially if one ha a natural propensity that way , ” he added , laughing again . “ But I ’ ve heard you have many friend here . You are , a they say , ‘ not without connections. ’ What can you want with me , then , unless you ’ ve some special object ? ” “ That ’ s true that I have friend here , ” Svidrigaïlov admitted , not replying to the chief point . “ I ’ ve met some already . I ’ ve been lounging about for the last three day , and I ’ ve seen them , or they ’ ve seen me . That ’ s a matter of course . I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man ; the emancipation of the serf hasn ’ t affected me ; my property consists chiefly of forest and water meadow . The revenue ha not fallen off ; but ... I am not going to see them , I wa sick of them long ago . I ’ ve been here three day and have called on no one .... What a town it is ! How ha it come into existence among u , tell me that ? A town of official and student of all sort . Yes , there ’ s a great deal I didn ’ t notice when I wa here eight year ago , kicking up my heel .... My only hope now is in anatomy , by Jove , it is ! ” “ Anatomy ? ” “ But a for these club , Dussauts , parade , or progress , indeed , maybe -- well , all that can go on without me , ” he went on , again without noticing the question . “ Besides , who want to be a card-sharper ? ” “ Why , have you been a card-sharper then ? ” “ How could I help being ? There wa a regular set of u , men of the best society , eight year ago ; we had a fine time . And all men of breeding , you know , poet , men of property . And indeed a a rule in our Russian society the best manner are found among those who ’ ve been thrashed , have you noticed that ? I ’ ve deteriorated in the country . But I did get into prison for debt , through a low Greek who came from Nezhin . Then Marfa Petrovna turned up ; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver piece ( I owed seventy thousand ) . We were united in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure . You know she wa five year older than I . She wa very fond of me . For seven year I never left the country . And , take note , that all my life she held a document over me , the IOU for thirty thousand rouble , so if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at once ! And she would have done it ! Women find nothing incompatible in that. ” “ If it hadn ’ t been for that , would you have given her the slip ? ” “ I don ’ t know what to say . It wa scarcely the document restrained me . I didn ’ t want to go anywhere else . Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad , seeing I wa bored , but I ’ ve been abroad before , and always felt sick there . For no reason , but the sunrise , the bay of Naples , the sea -- you look at them and it make you sad . What ’ s most revolting is that one is really sad ! No , it ’ s better at home . Here at least one blame others for everything and excuse oneself . I should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole , because _j ’ ai le vin mauvais_ and hate drinking , and there ’ s nothing left but wine . I have tried it . But , I say , I ’ ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passenger at a fee . Is it true ? ” “ Why , would you go up ? ” “ I ... No , oh , no , ” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in thought . “ What doe he mean ? Is he in earnest ? ” Raskolnikov wondered . “ No , the document didn ’ t restrain me , ” Svidrigaïlov went on , meditatively . “ It wa my own doing , not leaving the country , and nearly a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money , too . She had a fortune , you know . ‘ You see how I trust you , Arkady Ivanovitch ’ -- that wa actually her expression . You don ’ t believe she used it ? But do you know I managed the estate quite decently , they know me in the neighbourhood . I ordered book , too . Marfa Petrovna at first approved , but afterwards she wa afraid of my over-studying. ” “ You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much ? ” “ Missing her ? Perhaps . Really , perhaps I am . And , by the way , do you believe in ghost ? ” “ What ghost ? ” “ Why , ordinary ghosts. ” “ Do you believe in them ? ” “ Perhaps not , _pour vous plaire_ .... I wouldn ’ t say no exactly. ” “ Do you see them , then ? ” Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly . “ Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me , ” he said , twisting his mouth into a strange smile . “ How do you mean ‘ she is pleased to visit you ’ ? ” “ She ha been three time . I saw her first on the very day of the funeral , an hour after she wa buried . It wa the day before I left to come here . The second time wa the day before yesterday , at daybreak , on the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera , and the third time wa two hour ago in the room where I am staying . I wa alone. ” “ Were you awake ? ” “ Quite awake . I wa wide awake every time . She come , speaks to me for a minute and go out at the door -- always at the door . I can almost hear her. ” “ What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to you ? ” Raskolnikov said suddenly . At the same moment he wa surprised at having said it . He wa much excited . “ What ! Did you think so ? ” Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment . “ Did you really ? Didn ’ t I say that there wa something in common between u , eh ? ” “ You never said so ! ” Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat . “ Didn ’ t I ? ” “ No ! ” “ I thought I did . When I came in and saw you lying with your eye shut , pretending , I said to myself at once , ‘ Here ’ s the man. ’ ” “ What do you mean by ‘ the man ? ’ What are you talking about ? ” cried Raskolnikov . “ What do I mean ? I really don ’ t know .... ” Svidrigaïlov muttered ingenuously , a though he , too , were puzzled . For a minute they were silent . They stared in each other ’ s face . “ That ’ s all nonsense ! ” Raskolnikov shouted with vexation . “ What doe she say when she come to you ? ” “ She ! Would you believe it , she talk of the silliest trifle and -- man is a strange creature -- it make me angry . The first time she came in ( I wa tired you know : the funeral service , the funeral ceremony , the lunch afterwards . At last I wa left alone in my study . I lighted a cigar and began to think ) , she came in at the door . ‘ You ’ ve been so busy to-day , Arkady Ivanovitch , you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock , ’ she said . All those seven year I ’ ve wound that clock every week , and if I forgot it she would always remind me . The next day I set off on my way here . I got out at the station at daybreak ; I ’ d been asleep , tired out , with my eye half open , I wa drinking some coffee . I looked up and there wa suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of card in her hand . ‘ Shall I tell your fortune for the journey , Arkady Ivanovitch ? ’ She wa a great hand at telling fortune . I shall never forgive myself for not asking her to . I ran away in a fright , and , besides , the bell rang . I wa sitting to-day , feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop ; I wa sitting smoking , all of a sudden Marfa Petrovna again . She came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train . ‘ Good day , Arkady Ivanovitch ! How do you like my dress ? Aniska can ’ t make like this. ’ ( Aniska wa a dressmaker in the country , one of our former serf girl who had been trained in Moscow , a pretty wench . ) She stood turning round before me . I looked at the dress , and then I looked carefully , very carefully , at her face . ‘ I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifle , Marfa Petrovna. ’ ‘ Good gracious , you won ’ t let one disturb you about anything ! ’ To tease her I said , ‘ I want to get married , Marfa Petrovna. ’ ‘ That ’ s just like you , Arkady Ivanovitch ; it doe you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you ’ ve hardly buried your wife . And if you could make a good choice , at least , but I know it won ’ t be for your happiness or hers , you will only be a laughing-stock to all good people. ’ Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle . Isn ’ t it nonsense , eh ? ” “ But perhaps you are telling lie ? ” Raskolnikov put in . “ I rarely lie , ” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully , apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question . “ And in the past , have you ever seen ghost before ? ” “ Y-yes , I have seen them , but only once in my life , six year ago . I had a serf , Filka ; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘ Filka , my pipe ! ’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipe were . I sat still and thought ‘ he is doing it out of revenge , ’ because we had a violent quarrel just before his death . ‘ How dare you come in with a hole in your elbow ? ’ I said . ‘ Go away , you scamp ! ’ He turned and went out , and never came again . I didn ’ t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time . I wanted to have a service sung for him , but I wa ashamed. ” “ You should go to a doctor. ” “ I know I am not well , without your telling me , though I don ’ t know what ’ s wrong ; I believe I am five time a strong a you are . I didn ’ t ask you whether you believe that ghost are seen , but whether you believe that they exist. ” “ No , I won ’ t believe it ! ” Raskolnikov cried , with positive anger . “ What do people generally say ? ” muttered Svidrigaïlov , a though speaking to himself , looking aside and bowing his head . “ They say , ‘ You are ill , so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy. ’ But that ’ s not strictly logical . I agree that ghost only appear to the sick , but that only prof that they are unable to appear except to the sick , not that they don ’ t exist. ” “ Nothing of the sort , ” Raskolnikov insisted irritably . “ No ? You don ’ t think so ? ” Svidrigaïlov went on , looking at him deliberately . “ But what do you say to this argument ( help me with it ) : ghost are , a it were , shred and fragment of other world , the beginning of them . A man in health ha , of course , no reason to see them , because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life . But a soon a one is ill , a soon a the normal earthly order of the organism is broken , one begin to realise the possibility of another world ; and the more seriously ill one is , the closer becomes one ’ s contact with that other world , so that a soon a the man dy he step straight into that world . I thought of that long ago . If you believe in a future life , you could believe in that , too. ” “ I don ’ t believe in a future life , ” said Raskolnikov . Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought . “ And what if there are only spider there , or something of that sort , ” he said suddenly . “ He is a madman , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ We always imagine eternity a something beyond our conception , something vast , vast ! But why must it be vast ? Instead of all that , what if it ’ s one little room , like a bath house in the country , black and grimy and spider in every corner , and that ’ s all eternity is ? I sometimes fancy it like that. ” “ Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that ? ” Raskolnikov cried , with a feeling of anguish . “ Juster ? And how can we tell , perhaps that is just , and do you know it ’ s what I would certainly have made it , ” answered Svidrigaïlov , with a vague smile . This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov . Svidrigaïlov raised his head , looked at him , and suddenly began laughing . “ Only think , ” he cried , “ half an hour ago we had never seen each other , we regarded each other a enemy ; there is a matter unsettled between u ; we ’ ve thrown it aside , and away we ’ ve gone into the abstract ! Wasn ’ t I right in saying that we were bird of a feather ? ” “ Kindly allow me , ” Raskolnikov went on irritably , “ to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit ... and ... and I am in a hurry , I have no time to waste . I want to go out. ” “ By all mean , by all mean . Your sister , Avdotya Romanovna , is going to be married to Mr. Luzhin , Pyotr Petrovitch ? ” “ Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name ? I can ’ t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence , if you really are Svidrigaïlov. ” “ Why , but I ’ ve come here to speak about her ; how can I avoid mentioning her ? ” “ Very good , speak , but make haste. ” “ I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr. Luzhin , who is a connection of mine through my wife , if you have only seen him for half an hour , or heard any fact about him . He is no match for Avdotya Romanovna . I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of ... for the sake of her family . I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantage . Now I know you personally , I am convinced of it. ” “ All this is very naïve ... excuse me , I should have said impudent on your part , ” said Raskolnikov . “ You mean to say that I am seeking my own end . Don ’ t be uneasy , Rodion Romanovitch , if I were working for my own advantage , I would not have spoken out so directly . I am not quite a fool . I will confess something psychologically curious about that : just now , defending my love for Avdotya Romanovna , I said I wa myself the victim . Well , let me tell you that I ’ ve no feeling of love now , not the slightest , so that I wonder myself indeed , for I really did feel something ... ” “ Through idleness and depravity , ” Raskolnikov put in . “ I certainly am idle and depraved , but your sister ha such quality that even I could not help being impressed by them . But that ’ s all nonsense , a I see myself now. ” “ Have you seen that long ? ” “ I began to be aware of it before , but wa only perfectly sure of it the day before yesterday , almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg . I still fancied in Moscow , though , that I wa coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna ’ s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin. ” “ Excuse me for interrupting you ; kindly be brief , and come to the object of your visit . I am in a hurry , I want to go out ... ” “ With the greatest pleasure . On arriving here and determining on a certain ... journey , I should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangement . I left my child with an aunt ; they are well provided for ; and they have no need of me personally . And a nice father I should make , too ! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year ago . That ’ s enough for me . Excuse me , I am just coming to the point . Before the journey which may come off , I want to settle Mr. Luzhin , too . It ’ s not that I detest him so much , but it wa through him I quarrelled with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage . I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation , and if you like in your presence , to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin . Then , begging her pardon for all past unpleasantness , to make her a present of ten thousand rouble and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin , a rupture to which I believe she is herself not disinclined , if she could see the way to it. ” “ You are certainly mad , ” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered a astonished . “ How dare you talk like that ! ” “ I knew you would scream at me ; but in the first place , though I am not rich , this ten thousand rouble is perfectly free ; I have absolutely no need for it . If Avdotya Romanovna doe not accept it , I shall waste it in some more foolish way . That ’ s the first thing . Secondly , my conscience is perfectly easy ; I make the offer with no ulterior motive . You may not believe it , but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will know . The point is , that I did actually cause your sister , whom I greatly respect , some trouble and unpleasantness , and so , sincerely regretting it , I want -- not to compensate , not to repay her for the unpleasantness , but simply to do something to her advantage , to show that I am not , after all , privileged to do nothing but harm . If there were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer , I should not have made it so openly ; and I should not have offered her ten thousand only , when five week ago I offered her more , Besides , I may , perhaps , very soon marry a young lady , and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Romanovna . In conclusion , let me say that in marrying Mr. Luzhin , she is taking money just the same , only from another man . Don ’ t be angry , Rodion Romanovitch , think it over coolly and quietly. ” Svidrigaïlov himself wa exceedingly cool and quiet a he wa saying this . “ I beg you to say no more , ” said Raskolnikov . “ In any case this is unpardonable impertinence. ” “ Not in the least . Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour in this world , and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formality . That ’ s absurd . If I died , for instance , and left that sum to your sister in my will , surely she wouldn ’ t refuse it ? ” “ Very likely she would. ” “ Oh , no , indeed . However , if you refuse it , so be it , though ten thousand rouble is a capital thing to have on occasion . In any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna. ” “ No , I won ’ t. ” “ In that case , Rodion Romanovitch , I shall be obliged to try and see her myself and worry her by doing so. ” “ And if I do tell her , will you not try to see her ? ” “ I don ’ t know really what to say . I should like very much to see her once more. ” “ Don ’ t hope for it. ” “ I ’ m sorry . But you don ’ t know me . Perhaps we may become better friends. ” “ You think we may become friend ? ” “ And why not ? ” Svidrigaïlov said , smiling . He stood up and took his hat . “ I didn ’ t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning on it ... though I wa very much struck by your face this morning. ” “ Where did you see me this morning ? ” Raskolnikov asked uneasily . “ I saw you by chance .... I kept fancying there is something about you like me .... But don ’ t be uneasy . I am not intrusive ; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers , and I never bored Prince Svirbey , a great personage who is a distant relation of mine , and I could write about Raphael ’ s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov ’ s album , and I never left Marfa Petrovna ’ s side for seven year , and I used to stay the night at Viazemsky ’ s house in the Hay Market in the old day , and I may go up in a balloon with Berg , perhaps. ” “ Oh , all right . Are you starting soon on your travel , may I ask ? ” “ What travel ? ” “ Why , on that ‘ journey ’ ; you spoke of it yourself. ” “ A journey ? Oh , yes . I did speak of a journey . Well , that ’ s a wide subject .... if only you knew what you are asking , ” he added , and gave a sudden , loud , short laugh . “ Perhaps I ’ ll get married instead of the journey . They ’ re making a match for me. ” “ Here ? ” “ Yes. ” “ How have you had time for that ? ” “ But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once . I earnestly beg it . Well , good-bye for the present . Oh , yes . I have forgotten something . Tell your sister , Rodion Romanovitch , that Marfa Petrovna remembered her in her will and left her three thousand rouble . That ’ s absolutely certain . Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death , and it wa done in my presence . Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money in two or three weeks. ” “ Are you telling the truth ? ” “ Yes , tell her . Well , your servant . I am staying very near you. ” As he went out , Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway . CHAPTER II It wa nearly eight o ’ clock . The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev ’ s , to arrive before Luzhin . “ Why , who wa that ? ” asked Razumihin , a soon a they were in the street . “ It wa Svidrigaïlov , that landowner in whose house my sister wa insulted when she wa their governess . Through his persecuting her with his attention , she wa turned out by his wife , Marfa Petrovna . This Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia ’ s forgiveness afterwards , and she ’ s just died suddenly . It wa of her we were talking this morning . I don ’ t know why I ’ m afraid of that man . He came here at once after his wife ’ s funeral . He is very strange , and is determined on doing something .... We must guard Dounia from him ... that ’ s what I wanted to tell you , do you hear ? ” “ Guard her ! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna ? Thank you , Rodya , for speaking to me like that .... We will , we will guard her . Where doe he live ? ” “ I don ’ t know. ” “ Why didn ’ t you ask ? What a pity ! I ’ ll find out , though. ” “ Did you see him ? ” asked Raskolnikov after a pause . “ Yes , I noticed him , I noticed him well. ” “ You did really see him ? You saw him clearly ? ” Raskolnikov insisted . “ Yes , I remember him perfectly , I should know him in a thousand ; I have a good memory for faces. ” They were silent again . “ Hm ! ... that ’ s all right , ” muttered Raskolnikov . “ Do you know , I fancied ... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination. ” “ What do you mean ? I don ’ t understand you. ” “ Well , you all say , ” Raskolnikov went on , twisting his mouth into a smile , “ that I am mad . I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad , and have only seen a phantom. ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , who can tell ? Perhaps I am really mad , and perhaps everything that happened all these day may be only imagination. ” “ Ach , Rodya , you have been upset again ! ... But what did he say , what did he come for ? ” Raskolnikov did not answer . Razumihin thought a minute . “ Now let me tell you my story , ” he began , “ I came to you , you were asleep . Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry ’ s , Zametov wa still with him . I tried to begin , but it wa no use . I couldn ’ t speak in the right way . They don ’ t seem to understand and can ’ t understand , but are not a bit ashamed . I drew Porfiry to the window , and began talking to him , but it wa still no use . He looked away and I looked away . At last I shook my fist in his ugly face , and told him a a cousin I ’ d brain him . He merely looked at me , I cursed and came away . That wa all . It wa very stupid . To Zametov I didn ’ t say a word . But , you see , I thought I ’ d made a mess of it , but a I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me : why should we trouble ? Of course if you were in any danger or anything , but why need you care ? You needn ’ t care a hang for them . We shall have a laugh at them afterwards , and if I were in your place I ’ d mystify them more than ever . How ashamed they ’ ll be afterwards ! Hang them ! We can thrash them afterwards , but let ’ s laugh at them now ! ” “ To be sure , ” answered Raskolnikov . “ But what will you say to-morrow ? ” he thought to himself . Strange to say , till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew . As he thought it , Raskolnikov looked at him . Razumihin ’ s account of his visit to Porfiry had very little interest for him , so much had come and gone since then . In the corridor they came upon Luzhin ; he had arrived punctually at eight , and wa looking for the number , so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another . The young men walked in first , while Pyotr Petrovitch , for good manner , lingered a little in the passage , taking off his coat . Pulcheria Alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway , Dounia wa welcoming her brother . Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably , though with redoubled dignity , bowed to the lady . He looked , however , a though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself . Pulcheria Alexandrovna , who seemed also a little embarrassed , hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar wa boiling . Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite side of the table . Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna , Razumihin wa next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov wa beside his sister . A moment ’ s silence followed . Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted , and wa firmly resolved to insist on an explanation . In the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away , and so give the two lady a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position . But he could not bring himself to do this . Besides , he could not endure uncertainty , and he wanted an explanation : if his request had been so openly disobeyed , there wa something behind it , and in that case it wa better to find it out beforehand ; it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that . “ I trust you had a favourable journey , ” he inquired officially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ Oh , very , Pyotr Petrovitch. ” “ I am gratified to hear it . And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued either ? ” “ I am young and strong , I don ’ t get tired , but it wa a great strain for mother , ” answered Dounia . “ That ’ s unavoidable ! our national railway are of terrible length . ‘ Mother Russia , ’ a they say , is a vast country .... In spite of all my desire to do so , I wa unable to meet you yesterday . But I trust all passed off without inconvenience ? ” “ Oh , no , Pyotr Petrovitch , it wa all terribly disheartening , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation , “ and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent u , I really believe by God Himself , we should have been utterly lost . Here , he is ! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin , ” she added , introducing him to Luzhin . “ I had the pleasure ... yesterday , ” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin ; then he scowled and wa silent . Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of person , on the surface very polite in society , who make a great point of punctiliousness , but who , directly they are crossed in anything , are completely disconcerted , and become more like sack of flour than elegant and lively men of society . Again all wa silent ; Raskolnikov wa obstinately mute , Avdotya Romanovna wa unwilling to open the conversation too soon . Razumihin had nothing to say , so Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa anxious again . “ Marfa Petrovna is dead , have you heard ? ” she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation . “ To be sure , I heard so . I wa immediately informed , and I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife ’ s funeral . So at least I have excellent authority for believing. ” “ To Petersburg ? here ? ” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother . “ Yes , indeed , and doubtless not without some design , having in view the rapidity of his departure , and all the circumstance preceding it. ” “ Good heaven ! won ’ t he leave Dounia in peace even here ? ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any ground for uneasiness , unless , of course , you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him . For my part I am on my guard , and am now discovering where he is lodging. ” “ Oh , Pyotr Petrovitch , you would not believe what a fright you have given me , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on : “ I ’ ve only seen him twice , but I thought him terrible , terrible ! I am convinced that he wa the cause of Marfa Petrovna ’ s death. ” “ It ’ s impossible to be certain about that . I have precise information . I do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of event by the moral influence , so to say , of the affront ; but a to the general conduct and moral characteristic of that personage , I am in agreement with you . I do not know whether he is well off now , and precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him ; this will be known to me within a very short period ; but no doubt here in Petersburg , if he ha any pecuniary resource , he will relapse at once into his old way . He is the most depraved , and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men . I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna , who wa so unfortunate a to fall in love with him and to pay his debt eight year ago , wa of service to him also in another way . Solely by her exertion and sacrifice , a criminal charge , involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to Siberia , wa hushed up . That ’ s the sort of man he is , if you care to know. ” “ Good heaven ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . Raskolnikov listened attentively . “ Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this ? ” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically . “ I only repeat what I wa told in secret by Marfa Petrovna . I must observe that from the legal point of view the case wa far from clear . There wa , and I believe still is , living here a woman called Resslich , a foreigner , who lent small sum of money at interest , and did other commission , and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mysterious relation . She had a relation , a niece I believe , living with her , a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen , or perhaps not more than fourteen . Resslich hated this girl , and grudged her every crust ; she used to beat her mercilessly . One day the girl wa found hanging in the garret . At the inquest the verdict wa suicide . After the usual proceeding the matter ended , but , later on , information wa given that the child had been ... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov . It is true , this wa not clearly established , the information wa given by another German woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted ; no statement wa actually made to the police , thanks to Marfa Petrovna ’ s money and exertion ; it did not get beyond gossip . And yet the story is a very significant one . You heard , no doubt , Avdotya Romanovna , when you were with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he received six year ago , before the abolition of serfdom. ” “ I heard , on the contrary , that this Philip hanged himself. ” “ Quite so , but what drove him , or rather perhaps disposed him , to suicide wa the systematic persecution and severity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov. ” “ I don ’ t know that , ” answered Dounia , dryly . “ I only heard a queer story that Philip wa a sort of hypochondriac , a sort of domestic philosopher , the servant used to say , ‘ he read himself silly , ’ and that he hanged himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov ’ s mockery of him and not his blow . When I wa there he behaved well to the servant , and they were actually fond of him , though they certainly did blame him for Philip ’ s death. ” “ I perceive , Avdotya Romanovna , that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden , ” Luzhin observed , twisting his lip into an ambiguous smile , “ there ’ s no doubt that he is an astute man , and insinuating where lady are concerned , of which Marfa Petrovna , who ha died so strangely , is a terrible instance . My only desire ha been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice , in view of the renewed effort which may certainly be anticipated from him . For my part it ’ s my firm conviction , that he will end in a debtor ’ s prison again . Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him , having regard for his child ’ s interest , and , if she left him anything , it would only be the merest sufficiency , something insignificant and ephemeral , which would not last a year for a man of his habits. ” “ Pyotr Petrovitch , I beg you , ” said Dounia , “ say no more of Mr. Svidrigaïlov . It make me miserable. ” “ He ha just been to see me , ” said Raskolnikov , breaking his silence for the first time . There were exclamation from all , and they all turned to him . Even Pyotr Petrovitch wa roused . “ An hour and a half ago , he came in when I wa asleep , waked me , and introduced himself , ” Raskolnikov continued . “ He wa fairly cheerful and at ease , and quite hope that we shall become friend . He is particularly anxious , by the way , Dounia , for an interview with you , at which he asked me to assist . He ha a proposition to make to you , and he told me about it . He told me , too , that a week before her death Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand rouble in her will , Dounia , and that you can receive the money very shortly. ” “ Thank God ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna , crossing herself . “ Pray for her soul , Dounia ! ” “ It ’ s a fact ! ” broke from Luzhin . “ Tell u , what more ? ” Dounia urged Raskolnikov . “ Then he said that he wasn ’ t rich and all the estate wa left to his child who are now with an aunt , then that he wa staying somewhere not far from me , but where , I don ’ t know , I didn ’ t ask .... ” “ But what , what doe he want to propose to Dounia ? ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright . “ Did he tell you ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What wa it ? ” “ I ’ ll tell you afterwards. ” Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea . Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch . “ I am compelled to keep a business engagement , and so I shall not be in your way , ” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up . “ Don ’ t go , Pyotr Petrovitch , ” said Dounia , “ you intended to spend the evening . Besides , you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother. ” “ Precisely so , Avdotya Romanovna , ” Pyotr Petrovitch answered impressively , sitting down again , but still holding his hat . “ I certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed . But a your brother can not speak openly in my presence of some proposal of Mr. Svidrigaïlov , I , too , do not desire and am not able to speak openly ... in the presence of others ... of certain matter of the greatest gravity . Moreover , my most weighty and urgent request ha been disregarded .... ” Assuming an aggrieved air , Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence . “ Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting wa disregarded solely at my insistance , ” said Dounia . “ You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother ; I think that this must be explained at once , and you must be reconciled . And if Rodya really ha insulted you , then he _should_ and _will_ apologise. ” Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line . “ There are insult , Avdotya Romanovna , which no goodwill can make u forget . There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep ; and when it ha been overstepped , there is no return. ” “ That wasn ’ t what I wa speaking of exactly , Pyotr Petrovitch , ” Dounia interrupted with some impatience . “ Please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right a soon a possible . I tell you frankly at the start that I can not look at it in any other light , and if you have the least regard for me , all this business must be ended to-day , however hard that may be . I repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness. ” “ I am surprised at your putting the question like that , ” said Luzhin , getting more and more irritated . “ Esteeming , and so to say , adoring you , I may at the same time , very well indeed , be able to dislike some member of your family . Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand , I can not accept duty incompatible with ... ” “ Ah , don ’ t be so ready to take offence , Pyotr Petrovitch , ” Dounia interrupted with feeling , “ and be the sensible and generous man I have always considered , and wish to consider , you to be . I ’ ve given you a great promise , I am your betrothed . Trust me in this matter and , believe me , I shall be capable of judging impartially . My assuming the part of judge is a much a surprise for my brother a for you . When I insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter , I told him nothing of what I meant to do . Understand that , if you are not reconciled , I must choose between you -- it must be either you or he . That is how the question rest on your side and on his . I don ’ t want to be mistaken in my choice , and I must not be . For your sake I must break off with my brother , for my brother ’ s sake I must break off with you . I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me , and I want to know it ; and of you , whether I am dear to you , whether you esteem me , whether you are the husband for me. ” “ Avdotya Romanovna , ” Luzhin declared huffily , “ your word are of too much consequence to me ; I will say more , they are offensive in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you . To say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy , you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me . You say ‘ you or he , ’ showing thereby of how little consequence I am in your eye ... I can not let this pas considering the relationship and ... the obligation existing between us. ” “ What ! ” cried Dounia , flushing . “ I set your interest beside all that ha hitherto been most precious in my life , what ha made up the _whole_ of my life , and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of you. ” Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically , Razumihin fidgeted , but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the reproof ; on the contrary , at every word he became more persistent and irritable , a though he relished it . “ Love for the future partner of your life , for your husband , ought to outweigh your love for your brother , ” he pronounced sententiously , “ and in any case I can not be put on the same level .... Although I said so emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother ’ s presence , nevertheless , I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity . Your son , ” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna , “ yesterday in the presence of Mr. Razsudkin ( or ... I think that ’ s it ? excuse me I have forgotten your surname , ” he bowed politely to Razumihin ) “ insulted me by misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation , drinking coffee , that is , that marriage with a poor girl who ha had experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who ha lived in luxury , since it is more profitable for the moral character . Your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my word and made them ridiculous , accusing me of malicious intention , and , a far a I could see , relied upon your correspondence with him . I shall consider myself happy , Pulcheria Alexandrovna , if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion , and thereby considerately reassure me . Kindly let me know in what term precisely you repeated my word in your letter to Rodion Romanovitch. ” “ I don ’ t remember , ” faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ I repeated them a I understood them . I don ’ t know how Rodya repeated them to you , perhaps he exaggerated. ” “ He could not have exaggerated them , except at your instigation. ” “ Pyotr Petrovitch , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity , “ the proof that Dounia and I did not take your word in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here. ” “ Good , mother , ” said Dounia approvingly . “ Then this is my fault again , ” said Luzhin , aggrieved . “ Well , Pyotr Petrovitch , you keep blaming Rodion , but you yourself have just written what wa false about him , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added , gaining courage . “ I don ’ t remember writing anything false. ” “ You wrote , ” Raskolnikov said sharply , not turning to Luzhin , “ that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who wa killed , a wa the fact , but to his daughter ( whom I had never seen till yesterday ) . You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family , and for that object added coarse expression about the conduct of a girl whom you don ’ t know . All that is mean slander. ” “ Excuse me , sir , ” said Luzhin , quivering with fury . “ I enlarged upon your quality and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister ’ s and mother ’ s inquiry , how I found you , and what impression you made on me . As for what you ’ ve alluded to in my letter , be so good a to point out one word of falsehood , show , that is , that you didn ’ t throw away your money , and that there are not worthless person in that family , however unfortunate. ” “ To my thinking , you , with all your virtue , are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones. ” “ Would you go so far then a to let her associate with your mother and sister ? ” “ I have done so already , if you care to know . I made her sit down to-day with mother and Dounia. ” “ Rodya ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . Dounia crimsoned , Razumihin knitted his brow . Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm . “ You may see for yourself , Avdotya Romanovna , ” he said , “ whether it is possible for u to agree . I hope now that this question is at an end , once and for all . I will withdraw , that I may not hinder the pleasure of family intimacy , and the discussion of secrets. ” He got up from his chair and took his hat . “ But in withdrawing , I venture to request that for the future I may be spared similar meeting , and , so to say , compromise . I appeal particularly to you , honoured Pulcheria Alexandrovna , on this subject , the more a my letter wa addressed to you and to no one else. ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa a little offended . “ You seem to think we are completely under your authority , Pyotr Petrovitch . Dounia ha told you the reason your desire wa disregarded , she had the best intention . And indeed you write a though you were laying command upon me . Are we to consider every desire of yours a a command ? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for u now , because we have thrown up everything , and have come here relying on you , and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands. ” “ That is not quite true , Pulcheria Alexandrovna , especially at the present moment , when the news ha come of Marfa Petrovna ’ s legacy , which seems indeed very apropos , judging from the new tone you take to me , ” he added sarcastically . “ Judging from that remark , we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness , ” Dounia observed irritably . “ But now in any case I can not reckon on it , and I particularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposal of Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov , which he ha entrusted to your brother and which have , I perceive , a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you. ” “ Good heaven ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . Razumihin could not sit still on his chair . “ Aren ’ t you ashamed now , sister ? ” asked Raskolnikov . “ I am ashamed , Rodya , ” said Dounia . “ Pyotr Petrovitch , go away , ” she turned to him , white with anger . Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion . He had too much confidence in himself , in his power and in the helplessness of his victim . He could not believe it even now . He turned pale , and his lip quivered . “ Avdotya Romanovna , if I go out of this door now , after such a dismissal , then , you may reckon on it , I will never come back . Consider what you are doing . My word is not to be shaken. ” “ What insolence ! ” cried Dounia , springing up from her seat . “ I don ’ t want you to come back again. ” “ What ! So that ’ s how it stand ! ” cried Luzhin , utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now . “ So that ’ s how it stand ! But do you know , Avdotya Romanovna , that I might protest ? ” “ What right have you to speak to her like that ? ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna intervened hotly . “ And what can you protest about ? What right have you ? Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you ? Go away , leave u altogether ! We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action , and I above all .... ” “ But you have bound me , Pulcheria Alexandrovna , ” Luzhin stormed in a frenzy , “ by your promise , and now you deny it and ... besides ... I have been led on account of that into expense .... ” This last complaint wa so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch , that Raskolnikov , pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it , could not help breaking into laughter . But Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa furious . “ Expenses ? What expense ? Are you speaking of our trunk ? But the conductor brought it for nothing for you . Mercy on u , we have bound you ! What are you thinking about , Pyotr Petrovitch , it wa you bound u , hand and foot , not we ! ” “ Enough , mother , no more please , ” Avdotya Romanovna implored . “ Pyotr Petrovitch , do be kind and go ! ” “ I am going , but one last word , ” he said , quite unable to control himself . “ Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my mind to take you , so to speak , after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in regard to your reputation . Disregarding public opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation , I certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return , and might indeed look for gratitude on your part . And my eye have only now been opened ! I see myself that I may have acted very , very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict .... ” “ Does the fellow want his head smashed ? ” cried Razumihin , jumping up . “ You are a mean and spiteful man ! ” cried Dounia . “ Not a word ! Not a movement ! ” cried Raskolnikov , holding Razumihin back ; then going close up to Luzhin , “ Kindly leave the room ! ” he said quietly and distinctly , “ and not a word more or ... ” Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some second with a pale face that worked with anger , then he turned , went out , and rarely ha any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred a he felt against Raskolnikov . Him , and him alone , he blamed for everything . It is noteworthy that a he went downstairs he still imagined that his case wa perhaps not utterly lost , and that , so far a the lady were concerned , all might “ very well indeed ” be set right again . CHAPTER III The fact wa that up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending ; he had been overbearing to the last degree , never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless woman could escape from his control . This conviction wa strengthened by his vanity and conceit , a conceit to the point of fatuity . Pyotr Petrovitch , who had made his way up from insignificance , wa morbidly given to self-admiration , had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacity , and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass . But what he loved and valued above all wa the money he had amassed by his labour , and by all sort of device : that money made him the equal of all who had been his superior . When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in spite of evil report , Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had , indeed , felt genuinely indignant at such “ black ingratitude. ” And yet , when he made Dounia his offer , he wa fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip . The story had been everywhere contradicted by Marfa Petrovna , and wa by then disbelieved by all the townspeople , who were warm in Dounia ’ a defence . And he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time . Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it a something heroic . In speaking of it to Dounia , he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired , and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too . He had called on Raskolnikov with the feeling of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruit of his good deed and to hear agreeable flattery . And a he went downstairs now , he considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised . Dounia wa simply essential to him ; to do without her wa unthinkable . For many year he had had voluptuous dream of marriage , but he had gone on waiting and amassing money . He brooded with relish , in profound secret , over the image of a girl -- virtuous , poor ( she must be poor ) , very young , very pretty , of good birth and education , very timid , one who had suffered much , and wa completely humbled before him , one who would all her life look on him a her saviour , worship him , admire him and only him . How many scene , how many amorous episode he had imagined on this seductive and playful theme , when his work wa over ! And , behold , the dream of so many year wa all but realised ; the beauty and education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him ; her helpless position had been a great allurement ; in her he had found even more than he dreamed of . Here wa a girl of pride , character , virtue , of education and breeding superior to his own ( he felt that ) , and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension , and would humble herself in the dust before him , and he would have absolute , unbounded power over her ! ... Not long before , he had , too , after long reflection and hesitation , made an important change in his career and wa now entering on a wider circle of business . With this change his cherished dream of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised .... He wa , in fact , determined to try his fortune in Petersburg . He knew that woman could do a very great deal . The fascination of a charming , virtuous , highly educated woman might make his way easier , might do wonder in attracting people to him , throwing an aureole round him , and now everything wa in ruin ! This sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder ; it wa like a hideous joke , an absurdity . He had only been a tiny bit masterful , had not even time to speak out , had simply made a joke , been carried away -- and it had ended so seriously . And , of course , too , he did love Dounia in his own way ; he already possessed her in his dream -- and all at once ! No ! The next day , the very next day , it must all be set right , smoothed over , settled . Above all he must crush that conceited milksop who wa the cause of it all . With a sick feeling he could not help recalling Razumihin too , but , he soon reassured himself on that score ; a though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him ! The man he really dreaded in earnest wa Svidrigaïlov .... He had , in short , a great deal to attend to .... * * * * * “ No , I , I am more to blame than anyone ! ” said Dounia , kissing and embracing her mother . “ I wa tempted by his money , but on my honour , brother , I had no idea he wa such a base man . If I had seen through him before , nothing would have tempted me ! Don ’ t blame me , brother ! ” “ God ha delivered u ! God ha delivered u ! ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna muttered , but half consciously , a though scarcely able to realise what had happened . They were all relieved , and in five minute they were laughing . Only now and then Dounia turned white and frowned , remembering what had passed . Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa surprised to find that she , too , wa glad : she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible misfortune . Razumihin wa delighted . He did not yet dare to express his joy fully , but he wa in a fever of excitement a though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart . Now he had the right to devote his life to them , to serve them .... Anything might happen now ! But he felt afraid to think of further possibility and dared not let his imagination range . But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place , almost sullen and indifferent . Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of Luzhin , he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened . Dounia could not help thinking that he wa still angry with her , and Pulcheria Alexandrovna watched him timidly . “ What did Svidrigaïlov say to you ? ” said Dounia , approaching him . “ Yes , yes ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . Raskolnikov raised his head . “ He want to make you a present of ten thousand rouble and he desire to see you once in my presence. ” “ See her ! On no account ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ And how dare he offer her money ! ” Then Raskolnikov repeated ( rather dryly ) his conversation with Svidrigaïlov , omitting his account of the ghostly visitation of Marfa Petrovna , wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk . “ What answer did you give him ? ” asked Dounia . “ At first I said I would not take any message to you . Then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help . He assured me that his passion for you wa a passing infatuation , now he ha no feeling for you . He doesn ’ t want you to marry Luzhin .... His talk wa altogether rather muddled. ” “ How do you explain him to yourself , Rodya ? How did he strike you ? ” “ I must confess I don ’ t quite understand him . He offer you ten thousand , and yet say he is not well off . He say he is going away , and in ten minute he forgets he ha said it . Then he say he is going to be married and ha already fixed on the girl .... No doubt he ha a motive , and probably a bad one . But it ’ s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any design against you .... Of course , I refused this money on your account , once for all . Altogether , I thought him very strange .... One might almost think he wa mad . But I may be mistaken ; that may only be the part he assumes . The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made a great impression on him. ” “ God rest her soul , ” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna . “ I shall always , always pray for her ! Where should we be now , Dounia , without this three thousand ! It ’ s a though it had fallen from heaven ! Why , Rodya , this morning we had only three rouble in our pocket and Dounia and I were just planning to pawn her watch , so a to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help. ” Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov ’ s offer . She still stood meditating . “ He ha got some terrible plan , ” she said in a half whisper to herself , almost shuddering . Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror . “ I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again , ” he said to Dounia . “ We will watch him ! I will track him out ! ” cried Razumihin , vigorously . “ I won ’ t lose sight of him . Rodya ha given me leave . He said to me himself just now . ‘ Take care of my sister. ’ Will you give me leave , too , Avdotya Romanovna ? ” Dounia smiled and held out her hand , but the look of anxiety did not leave her face . Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly , but the three thousand rouble had obviously a soothing effect on her . A quarter of an hour later , they were all engaged in a lively conversation . Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time , though he did not talk . Razumihin wa the speaker . “ And why , why should you go away ? ” he flowed on ecstatically . “ And what are you to do in a little town ? The great thing is , you are all here together and you need one another -- you do need one another , believe me . For a time , anyway .... Take me into partnership , and I assure you we ’ ll plan a capital enterprise . Listen ! I ’ ll explain it all in detail to you , the whole project ! It all flashed into my head this morning , before anything had happened ... I tell you what ; I have an uncle , I must introduce him to you ( a most accommodating and respectable old man ) . This uncle ha got a capital of a thousand rouble , and he life on his pension and ha no need of that money . For the last two year he ha been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent . interest . I know what that mean ; he simply want to help me . Last year I had no need of it , but this year I resolved to borrow it a soon a he arrived . Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start , so we ’ ll go into partnership , and what are we going to do ? ” Then Razumihin began to unfold his project , and he explained at length that almost all our publisher and bookseller know nothing at all of what they are selling , and for that reason they are usually bad publisher , and that any decent publication pay a a rule and give a profit , sometimes a considerable one . Razumihin had , indeed , been dreaming of setting up a a publisher . For the last two year he had been working in publisher ’ office , and knew three European language well , though he had told Raskolnikov six day before that he wa “ schwach ” in German with an object of persuading him to take half his translation and half the payment for it . He had told a lie then , and Raskolnikov knew he wa lying . “ Why , why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief mean of success -- money of our own ! ” cried Razumihin warmly . “ Of course there will be a lot of work , but we will work , you , Avdotya Romanovna , I , Rodion .... You get a splendid profit on some book nowadays ! And the great point of the business is that we shall know just what want translating , and we shall be translating , publishing , learning all at once . I can be of use because I have experience . For nearly two year I ’ ve been scuttling about among the publisher , and now I know every detail of their business . You need not be a saint to make pot , believe me ! And why , why should we let our chance slip ! Why , I know -- and I kept the secret -- two or three book which one might get a hundred rouble simply for thinking of translating and publishing . Indeed , and I would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them . And what do you think ? If I were to tell a publisher , I dare say he ’ d hesitate -- they are such blockhead ! And a for the business side , printing , paper , selling , you trust to me , I know my way about . We ’ ll begin in a small way and go on to a large . In any case it will get u our living and we shall get back our capital. ” Dounia ’ s eye shone . “ I like what you are saying , Dmitri Prokofitch ! ” she said . “ I know nothing about it , of course , ” put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna , “ it may be a good idea , but again God know . It ’ s new and untried . Of course , we must remain here at least for a time. ” She looked at Rodya . “ What do you think , brother ? ” said Dounia . “ I think he ’ s got a very good idea , ” he answered . “ Of course , it ’ s too soon to dream of a publishing firm , but we certainly might bring out five or six book and be sure of success . I know of one book myself which would be sure to go well . And a for his being able to manage it , there ’ s no doubt about that either . He know the business .... But we can talk it over later .... ” “ Hurrah ! ” cried Razumihin . “ Now , stay , there ’ s a flat here in this house , belonging to the same owner . It ’ s a special flat apart , not communicating with these lodging . It ’ s furnished , rent moderate , three room . Suppose you take them to begin with . I ’ ll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring you the money , and everything can be arranged then . You can all three live together , and Rodya will be with you . But where are you off to , Rodya ? ” “ What , Rodya , you are going already ? ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in dismay . “ At such a minute ? ” cried Razumihin . Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder . He held his cap in his hand , he wa preparing to leave them . “ One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever , ” he said somewhat oddly . He attempted to smile , but it did not turn out a smile . “ But who know , perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other ... ” he let slip accidentally . It wa what he wa thinking , and it somehow wa uttered aloud . “ What is the matter with you ? ” cried his mother . “ Where are you going , Rodya ? ” asked Dounia rather strangely . “ Oh , I ’ m quite obliged to ... ” he answered vaguely , a though hesitating what he would say . But there wa a look of sharp determination in his white face . “ I meant to say ... a I wa coming here ... I meant to tell you , mother , and you , Dounia , that it would be better for u to part for a time . I feel ill , I am not at peace .... I will come afterwards , I will come of myself ... when it ’ s possible . I remember you and love you .... Leave me , leave me alone . I decided this even before ... I ’ m absolutely resolved on it . Whatever may come to me , whether I come to ruin or not , I want to be alone . Forget me altogether , it ’ s better . Don ’ t inquire about me . When I can , I ’ ll come of myself or ... I ’ ll send for you . Perhaps it will all come back , but now if you love me , give me up ... else I shall begin to hate you , I feel it .... Good-bye ! ” “ Good God ! ” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna . Both his mother and his sister were terribly alarmed . Razumihin wa also . “ Rodya , Rodya , be reconciled with u ! Let u be a before ! ” cried his poor mother . He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room . Dounia overtook him . “ Brother , what are you doing to mother ? ” she whispered , her eye flashing with indignation . He looked dully at her . “ No matter , I shall come .... I ’ m coming , ” he muttered in an undertone , a though not fully conscious of what he wa saying , and he went out of the room . “ Wicked , heartless egoist ! ” cried Dounia . “ He is insane , but not heartless . He is mad ! Don ’ t you see it ? You ’ re heartless after that ! ” Razumihin whispered in her ear , squeezing her hand tightly . “ I shall be back directly , ” he shouted to the horror-stricken mother , and he ran out of the room . Raskolnikov wa waiting for him at the end of the passage . “ I knew you would run after me , ” he said . “ Go back to them -- be with them ... be with them to-morrow and always .... I ... perhaps I shall come ... if I can . Good-bye. ” And without holding out his hand he walked away . “ But where are you going ? What are you doing ? What ’ s the matter with you ? How can you go on like this ? ” Razumihin muttered , at his wit ’ end . Raskolnikov stopped once more . “ Once for all , never ask me about anything . I have nothing to tell you . Don ’ t come to see me . Maybe I ’ ll come here .... Leave me , but _don ’ t leave_ them . Do you understand me ? ” It wa dark in the corridor , they were standing near the lamp . For a minute they were looking at one another in silence . Razumihin remembered that minute all his life . Raskolnikov ’ s burning and intent eye grew more penetrating every moment , piercing into his soul , into his consciousness . Suddenly Razumihin started . Something strange , a it were , passed between them .... Some idea , some hint , a it were , slipped , something awful , hideous , and suddenly understood on both side .... Razumihin turned pale . “ Do you understand now ? ” said Raskolnikov , his face twitching nervously . “ Go back , go to them , ” he said suddenly , and turning quickly , he went out of the house . I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the lady , how he soothed them , how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his illness , protested that Rodya wa sure to come , that he would come every day , that he wa very , very much upset , that he must not be irritated , that he , Razumihin , would watch over him , would get him a doctor , the best doctor , a consultation .... In fact from that evening Razumihin took his place with them a a son and a brother . CHAPTER IV Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia lived . It wa an old green house of three storey . He found the porter and obtained from him vague direction a to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov , the tailor . Having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase , he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard . While he wa wandering in the darkness , uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov ’ s door , a door opened three pace from him ; he mechanically took hold of it . “ Who is there ? ” a woman ’ s voice asked uneasily . “ It ’ s I ... come to see you , ” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry . On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick . “ It ’ s you ! Good heaven ! ” cried Sonia weakly , and she stood rooted to the spot . “ Which is your room ? This way ? ” and Raskolnikov , trying not to look at her , hastened in . A minute later Sonia , too , came in with the candle , set down the candlestick and , completely disconcerted , stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit . The colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tear came into her eye ... She felt sick and ashamed and happy , too .... Raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table . He scanned the room in a rapid glance . It wa a large but exceedingly low-pitched room , the only one let by the Kapernaumovs , to whose room a closed door led in the wall on the left . In the opposite side on the right hand wall wa another door , always kept locked . That led to the next flat , which formed a separate lodging . Sonia ’ s room looked like a barn ; it wa a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance . A wall with three window looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle , and it wa difficult to see in it without very strong light . The other corner wa disproportionately obtuse . There wa scarcely any furniture in the big room : in the corner on the right wa a bedstead , beside it , nearest the door , a chair . A plain , deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall , close to the door into the other flat . Two rush-bottom chair stood by the table . On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawer looking , a it were , lost in a desert . That wa all there wa in the room . The yellow , scratched and shabby wall-paper wa black in the corner . It must have been damp and full of fume in the winter . There wa every sign of poverty ; even the bedstead had no curtain . Sonia looked in silence at her visitor , who wa so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room , and even began at last to tremble with terror , a though she wa standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destiny . “ I am late .... It ’ s eleven , isn ’ t it ? ” he asked , still not lifting his eye . “ Yes , ” muttered Sonia , “ oh yes , it is , ” she added , hastily , a though in that lay her mean of escape . “ My landlady ’ s clock ha just struck ... I heard it myself .... ” “ I ’ ve come to you for the last time , ” Raskolnikov went on gloomily , although this wa the first time . “ I may perhaps not see you again ... ” “ Are you ... going away ? ” “ I don ’ t know ... to-morrow .... ” “ Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow ? ” Sonia ’ s voice shook . “ I don ’ t know . I shall know to-morrow morning .... Never mind that : I ’ ve come to say one word .... ” He raised his brooding eye to her and suddenly noticed that he wa sitting down while she wa all the while standing before him . “ Why are you standing ? Sit down , ” he said in a changed voice , gentle and friendly . She sat down . He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her . “ How thin you are ! What a hand ! Quite transparent , like a dead hand. ” He took her hand . Sonia smiled faintly . “ I have always been like that , ” she said . “ Even when you lived at home ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Of course , you were , ” he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly . He looked round him once more . “ You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs ? ” “ Yes .... ” “ They live there , through that door ? ” “ Yes .... They have another room like this. ” “ All in one room ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I should be afraid in your room at night , ” he observed gloomily . “ They are very good people , very kind , ” answered Sonia , who still seemed bewildered , “ and all the furniture , everything ... everything is theirs . And they are very kind and the child , too , often come to see me. ” “ They all stammer , don ’ t they ? ” “ Yes .... He stammer and he ’ s lame . And his wife , too .... It ’ s not exactly that she stammer , but she can ’ t speak plainly . She is a very kind woman . And he used to be a house serf . And there are seven child ... and it ’ s only the eldest one that stammer and the others are simply ill ... but they don ’ t stammer .... But where did you hear about them ? ” she added with some surprise . “ Your father told me , then . He told me all about you .... And how you went out at six o ’ clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed. ” Sonia wa confused . “ I fancied I saw him to-day , ” she whispered hesitatingly . “ Whom ? ” “ Father . I wa walking in the street , out there at the corner , about ten o ’ clock and he seemed to be walking in front . It looked just like him . I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna .... ” “ You were walking in the street ? ” “ Yes , ” Sonia whispered abruptly , again overcome with confusion and looking down . “ Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you , I dare say ? ” “ Oh no , what are you saying ? No ! ” Sonia looked at him almost with dismay . “ You love her , then ? ” “ Love her ? Of course ! ” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis , and she clasped her hand in distress . “ Ah , you don ’ t .... If you only knew ! You see , she is quite like a child .... Her mind is quite unhinged , you see ... from sorrow . And how clever she used to be ... how generous ... how kind ! Ah , you don ’ t understand , you don ’ t understand ! ” Sonia said this a though in despair , wringing her hand in excitement and distress . Her pale cheek flushed , there wa a look of anguish in her eye . It wa clear that she wa stirred to the very depth , that she wa longing to speak , to champion , to express something . A sort of _insatiable_ compassion , if one may so express it , wa reflected in every feature of her face . “ Beat me ! how can you ? Good heaven , beat me ! And if she did beat me , what then ? What of it ? You know nothing , nothing about it .... She is so unhappy ... ah , how unhappy ! And ill .... She is seeking righteousness , she is pure . She ha such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere and she expects it .... And if you were to torture her , she wouldn ’ t do wrong . She doesn ’ t see that it ’ s impossible for people to be righteous and she is angry at it . Like a child , like a child . She is good ! ” “ And what will happen to you ? ” Sonia looked at him inquiringly . “ They are left on your hand , you see . They were all on your hand before , though .... And your father came to you to beg for drink . Well , how will it be now ? ” “ I don ’ t know , ” Sonia articulated mournfully . “ Will they stay there ? ” “ I don ’ t know .... They are in debt for the lodging , but the landlady , I hear , said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them , and Katerina Ivanovna say that she won ’ t stay another minute. ” “ How is it she is so bold ? She relies upon you ? ” “ Oh , no , don ’ t talk like that .... We are one , we live like one. ” Sonia wa agitated again and even angry , a though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry . “ And what could she do ? What , what could she do ? ” she persisted , getting hot and excited . “ And how she cried to-day ! Her mind is unhinged , haven ’ t you noticed it ? At one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow , the lunch and all that .... Then she is wringing her hand , spitting blood , weeping , and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall , in despair . Then she will be comforted again . She build all her hope on you ; she say that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughter of gentleman and take me to superintend it , and we will begin a new splendid life . And she kiss and hug me , comfort me , and you know she ha such faith , such faith in her fancy ! One can ’ t contradict her . And all the day long she ha been washing , cleaning , mending . She dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hand and sank on the bed , gasping for breath . We went this morning to the shop to buy shoe for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn out . Only the money we ’ d reckoned wasn ’ t enough , not nearly enough . And she picked out such dear little boot , for she ha taste , you don ’ t know . And there in the shop she burst out cry before the shopmen because she hadn ’ t enough .... Ah , it wa sad to see her .... ” “ Well , after that I can understand your living like this , ” Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile . “ And aren ’ t you sorry for them ? Aren ’ t you sorry ? ” Sonia flew at him again . “ Why , I know , you gave your last penny yourself , though you ’ d seen nothing of it , and if you ’ d seen everything , oh dear ! And how often , how often I ’ ve brought her to tear ! Only last week ! Yes , I ! Only a week before his death . I wa cruel ! And how often I ’ ve done it ! Ah , I ’ ve been wretched at the thought of it all day ! ” Sonia wrung her hand a she spoke at the pain of remembering it . “ You were cruel ? ” “ Yes , I -- I. I went to see them , ” she went on , weeping , “ and father said , ‘ read me something , Sonia , my head ache , read to me , here ’ s a book. ’ He had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov , he life there , he always used to get hold of such funny book . And I said , ‘ I can ’ t stay , ’ a I didn ’ t want to read , and I ’ d gone in chiefly to show Katerina Ivanovna some collar . Lizaveta , the pedlar , sold me some collar and cuff cheap , pretty , new , embroidered one . Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much ; she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and wa delighted with them . ‘ Make me a present of them , Sonia , ’ she said , ‘ please do. ’ ‘ _Please do_ , ’ she said , she wanted them so much . And when could she wear them ? They just reminded her of her old happy day . She looked at herself in the glass , admired herself , and she ha no clothes at all , no thing of her own , hasn ’ t had all these year ! And she never asks anyone for anything ; she is proud , she ’ d sooner give away everything . And these she asked for , she liked them so much . And I wa sorry to give them . ‘ What use are they to you , Katerina Ivanovna ? ’ I said . I spoke like that to her , I ought not to have said that ! She gave me such a look . And she wa so grieved , so grieved at my refusing her . And it wa so sad to see .... And she wa not grieved for the collar , but for my refusing , I saw that . Ah , if only I could bring it all back , change it , take back those word ! Ah , if I ... but it ’ s nothing to you ! ” “ Did you know Lizaveta , the pedlar ? ” “ Yes .... Did you know her ? ” Sonia asked with some surprise . “ Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption , rapid consumption ; she will soon die , ” said Raskolnikov after a pause , without answering her question . “ Oh , no , no , no ! ” And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hand , a though imploring that she should not . “ But it will be better if she doe die. ” “ No , not better , not at all better ! ” Sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay . “ And the child ? What can you do except take them to live with you ? ” “ Oh , I don ’ t know , ” cried Sonia , almost in despair , and she put her hand to her head . It wa evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again . “ And , what , if even now , while Katerina Ivanovna is alive , you get ill and are taken to the hospital , what will happen then ? ” he persisted pitilessly . “ How can you ? That can not be ! ” And Sonia ’ s face worked with awful terror . “ Can not be ? ” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile . “ You are not insured against it , are you ? What will happen to them then ? They will be in the street , all of them , she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall , a she did to-day , and the child will cry .... Then she will fall down , be taken to the police station and to the hospital , she will die , and the child ... ” “ Oh , no .... God will not let it be ! ” broke at last from Sonia ’ s overburdened bosom . She listened , looking imploringly at him , clasping her hand in dumb entreaty , a though it all depended upon him . Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room . A minute passed . Sonia wa standing with her hand and her head hanging in terrible dejection . “ And can ’ t you save ? Put by for a rainy day ? ” he asked , stopping suddenly before her . “ No , ” whispered Sonia . “ Of course not . Have you tried ? ” he added almost ironically . “ Yes. ” “ And it didn ’ t come off ! Of course not ! No need to ask. ” And again he paced the room . Another minute passed . “ You don ’ t get money every day ? ” Sonia wa more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again . “ No , ” she whispered with a painful effort . “ It will be the same with Polenka , no doubt , ” he said suddenly . “ No , no ! It can ’ t be , no ! ” Sonia cried aloud in desperation , a though she had been stabbed . “ God would not allow anything so awful ! ” “ He let others come to it. ” “ No , no ! God will protect her , God ! ” she repeated beside herself . “ But , perhaps , there is no God at all , ” Raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance , laughed and looked at her . Sonia ’ s face suddenly changed ; a tremor passed over it . She looked at him with unutterable reproach , tried to say something , but could not speak and broke into bitter , bitter sob , hiding her face in her hand . “ You say Katerina Ivanovna ’ s mind is unhinged ; your own mind is unhinged , ” he said after a brief silence . Five minute passed . He still paced up and down the room in silence , not looking at her . At last he went up to her ; his eye glittered . He put his two hand on her shoulder and looked straight into her tearful face . His eye were hard , feverish and piercing , his lip were twitching . All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground , kissed her foot . Sonia drew back from him a from a madman . And certainly he looked like a madman . “ What are you doing to me ? ” she muttered , turning pale , and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart . He stood up at once . “ I did not bow down to you , I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity , ” he said wildly and walked away to the window . “ Listen , ” he added , turning to her a minute later . “ I said just now to an insolent man that he wa not worth your little finger ... and that I did my sister honour making her sit beside you. ” “ Ach , you said that to them ! And in her presence ? ” cried Sonia , frightened . “ Sit down with me ! An honour ! Why , I ’ m ... dishonourable .... Ah , why did you say that ? ” “ It wa not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you , but because of your great suffering . But you are a great sinner , that ’ s true , ” he added almost solemnly , “ and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_ . Isn ’ t that fearful ? Isn ’ t it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so , and at the same time you know yourself ( you ’ ve only to open your eye ) that you are not helping anyone by it , not saving anyone from anything ? Tell me , ” he went on almost in a frenzy , “ how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other , opposite , holy feeling ? It would be better , a thousand time better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all ! ” “ But what would become of them ? ” Sonia asked faintly , gazing at him with eye of anguish , but not seeming surprised at his suggestion . Raskolnikov looked strangely at her . He read it all in her face ; so she must have had that thought already , perhaps many time , and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly , that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion . She had not even noticed the cruelty of his word . ( The significance of his reproach and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had , of course , not noticed either , and that , too , wa clear to him . ) But he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful , shameful position wa torturing her and had long tortured her . “ What , what , ” he thought , “ could hitherto have hindered her from putting an end to it ? ” Only then he realised what those poor little orphan child and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna , knocking her head against the wall in her consumption , meant for Sonia . But , nevertheless , it wa clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received , she could not in any case remain so . He wa still confronted by the question , how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind , since she could not bring herself to jump into the water ? Of course he knew that Sonia ’ s position wa an exceptional case , though unhappily not unique and not infrequent , indeed ; but that very exceptionalness , her tinge of education , her previous life might , one would have thought , have killed her at the first step on that revolting path . What held her up -- surely not depravity ? All that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically , not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart ; he saw that . He saw through her a she stood before him .... “ There are three way before her , ” he thought , “ the canal , the madhouse , or ... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turn the heart to stone. ” The last idea wa the most revolting , but he wa a sceptic , he wa young , abstract , and therefore cruel , and so he could not help believing that the last end wa the most likely . “ But can that be true ? ” he cried to himself . “ Can that creature who ha still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity ? Can the process already have begun ? Can it be that she ha only been able to bear it till now , because vice ha begun to be le loathsome to her ? No , no , that can not be ! ” he cried , a Sonia had just before . “ No , what ha kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they , the child .... And if she ha not gone out of her mind ... but who say she ha not gone out of her mind ? Is she in her sens ? Can one talk , can one reason a she doe ? How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger ? Does she expect a miracle ? No doubt she doe . Doesn ’ t that all mean madness ? ” He stayed obstinately at that thought . He liked that explanation indeed better than any other . He began looking more intently at her . “ So you pray to God a great deal , Sonia ? ” he asked her . Sonia did not speak ; he stood beside her waiting for an answer . “ What should I be without God ? ” she whispered rapidly , forcibly , glancing at him with suddenly flashing eye , and squeezing his hand . “ Ah , so that is it ! ” he thought . “ And what doe God do for you ? ” he asked , probing her further . Sonia wa silent a long while , a though she could not answer . Her weak chest kept heaving with emotion . “ Be silent ! Don ’ t ask ! You don ’ t deserve ! ” she cried suddenly , looking sternly and wrathfully at him . “ That ’ s it , that ’ s it , ” he repeated to himself . “ He doe everything , ” she whispered quickly , looking down again . “ That ’ s the way out ! That ’ s the explanation , ” he decided , scrutinising her with eager curiosity , with a new , strange , almost morbid feeling . He gazed at that pale , thin , irregular , angular little face , those soft blue eye , which could flash with such fire , such stern energy , that little body still shaking with indignation and anger -- and it all seemed to him more and more strange , almost impossible . “ She is a religious maniac ! ” he repeated to himself . There wa a book lying on the chest of drawer . He had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room . Now he took it up and looked at it . It wa the New Testament in the Russian translation . It wa bound in leather , old and worn . “ Where did you get that ? ” he called to her across the room . She wa still standing in the same place , three step from the table . “ It wa brought me , ” she answered , a it were unwillingly , not looking at him . “ Who brought it ? ” “ Lizaveta , I asked her for it. ” “ Lizaveta ! strange ! ” he thought . Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment . He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the page . “ Where is the story of Lazarus ? ” he asked suddenly . Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer . She wa standing sideways to the table . “ Where is the raising of Lazarus ? Find it for me , Sonia. ” She stole a glance at him . “ You are not looking in the right place .... It ’ s in the fourth gospel , ” she whispered sternly , without looking at him . “ Find it and read it to me , ” he said . He sat down with his elbow on the table , leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly , prepared to listen . “ In three week ’ time they ’ ll welcome me in the madhouse ! I shall be there if I am not in a worse place , ” he muttered to himself . Sonia heard Raskolnikov ’ s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table . She took the book however . “ Haven ’ t you read it ? ” she asked , looking up at him across the table . Her voice became sterner and sterner . “ Long ago .... When I wa at school . Read ! ” “ And haven ’ t you heard it in church ? ” “ I ... haven ’ t been . Do you often go ? ” “ N-no , ” whispered Sonia . Raskolnikov smiled . “ I understand .... And you won ’ t go to your father ’ s funeral to-morrow ? ” “ Yes , I shall . I wa at church last week , too ... I had a requiem service. ” “ For whom ? ” “ For Lizaveta . She wa killed with an axe. ” His nerve were more and more strained . His head began to go round . “ Were you friend with Lizaveta ? ” “ Yes .... She wa good ... she used to come ... not often ... she couldn ’ t .... We used to read together and ... talk . She will see God. ” The last phrase sounded strange in his ear . And here wa something new again : the mysterious meeting with Lizaveta and both of them -- religious maniac . “ I shall be a religious maniac myself soon ! It ’ s infectious ! ” “ Read ! ” he cried irritably and insistently . Sonia still hesitated . Her heart wa throbbing . She hardly dared to read to him . He looked almost with exasperation at the “ unhappy lunatic. ” “ What for ? You don ’ t believe ? ... ” she whispered softly and a it were breathlessly . “ Read ! I want you to , ” he persisted . “ You used to read to Lizaveta. ” Sonia opened the book and found the place . Her hand were shaking , her voice failed her . Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable . “ Now a certain man wa sick named Lazarus of Bethany ... ” she forced herself at last to read , but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string . There wa a catch in her breath . Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this , the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so . He understood only too well how painful it wa for her to betray and unveil all that wa her _own_ . He understood that these feeling really were her _secret treasure_ , which she had kept perhaps for year , perhaps from childhood , while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief , in the midst of starving child and unseemly abuse and reproach . But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that , although it filled her with dread and suffering , yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to _him_ that he might hear it , and to read _now_ whatever might come of it ! ... He read this in her eye , he could see it in her intense emotion . She mastered herself , controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John . She went on to the nineteenth verse : “ And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother . “ Then Martha a soon a she heard that Jesus wa coming went and met Him : but Mary sat still in the house . “ Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if Thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . “ But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God , God will give it Thee .... ” Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again . “ Jesus said unto her , thy brother shall rise again . “ Martha saith unto Him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection , at the last day . “ Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection and the life : he that believeth in Me though he were dead , yet shall he live . “ And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die . Believest thou this ? “ She saith unto Him , ” ( And drawing a painful breath , Sonia read distinctly and forcibly a though she were making a public confession of faith . ) “ Yea , Lord : I believe that Thou art the Christ , the Son of God Which should come into the world. ” She stopped and looked up quickly at him , but controlling herself went on reading . Raskolnikov sat without moving , his elbow on the table and his eye turned away . She read to the thirty-second verse . “ Then when Mary wa come where Jesus wa and saw Him , she fell down at His foot , saying unto Him , Lord if Thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . “ When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , He groaned in the spirit and wa troubled , “ And said , Where have ye laid him ? They said unto Him , Lord , come and see . “ Jesus wept . “ Then said the Jews , behold how He loved him ! “ And some of them said , could not this Man which opened the eye of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ? ” Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion . Yes , he had known it ! She wa trembling in a real physical fever . He had expected it . She wa getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her . Her voice rang out like a bell ; triumph and joy gave it power . The line danced before her eye , but she knew what she wa reading by heart . At the last verse “ Could not this Man which opened the eye of the blind ... ” dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt , the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews , who in another moment would fall at His foot a though struck by thunder , sobbing and believing .... “ And _he , he_ -- too , is blinded and unbelieving , he , too , will hear , he , too , will believe , yes , yes ! At once , now , ” wa what she wa dreaming , and she wa quivering with happy anticipation . “ Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave . It wa a cave , and a stone lay upon it . “ Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that wa dead , saith unto Him , Lord by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days. ” She laid emphasis on the word _four_ . “ Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? “ Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead wa laid . And Jesus lifted up His eye and said , Father , I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me . “ And I knew that Thou hearest Me always ; but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me . “ And when He thus had spoken , He cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth . “ And he that wa dead came forth. ” ( She read loudly , cold and trembling with ecstasy , a though she were seeing it before her eye . ) “ Bound hand and foot with graveclothes ; and his face wa bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him and let him go . “ Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the thing which Jesus did believed on Him. ” She could read no more , closed the book and got up from her chair quickly . “ That is all about the raising of Lazarus , ” she whispered severely and abruptly , and turning away she stood motionless , not daring to raise her eye to him . She still trembled feverishly . The candle-end wa flickering out in the battered candlestick , dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book . Five minute or more passed . “ I came to speak of something , ” Raskolnikov said aloud , frowning . He got up and went to Sonia . She lifted her eye to him in silence . His face wa particularly stern and there wa a sort of savage determination in it . “ I have abandoned my family to-day , ” he said , “ my mother and sister . I am not going to see them . I ’ ve broken with them completely. ” “ What for ? ” asked Sonia amazed . Her recent meeting with his mother and sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse . She heard his news almost with horror . “ I have only you now , ” he added . “ Let u go together .... I ’ ve come to you , we are both accursed , let u go our way together ! ” His eye glittered “ a though he were mad , ” Sonia thought , in her turn . “ Go where ? ” she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back . “ How do I know ? I only know it ’ s the same road , I know that and nothing more . It ’ s the same goal ! ” She looked at him and understood nothing . She knew only that he wa terribly , infinitely unhappy . “ No one of them will understand , if you tell them , but I have understood . I need you , that is why I have come to you. ” “ I don ’ t understand , ” whispered Sonia . “ You ’ ll understand later . Haven ’ t you done the same ? You , too , have transgressed ... have had the strength to transgress . You have laid hand on yourself , you have destroyed a life ... _your own_ ( it ’ s all the same ! ) . You might have lived in spirit and understanding , but you ’ ll end in the Hay Market .... But you won ’ t be able to stand it , and if you remain alone you ’ ll go out of your mind like me . You are like a mad creature already . So we must go together on the same road ! Let u go ! ” “ What for ? What ’ s all this for ? ” said Sonia , strangely and violently agitated by his word . “ What for ? Because you can ’ t remain like this , that ’ s why ! You must look thing straight in the face at last , and not weep like a child and cry that God won ’ t allow it . What will happen , if you should really be taken to the hospital to-morrow ? She is mad and in consumption , she ’ ll soon die and the child ? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won ’ t come to grief ? Haven ’ t you seen child here at the street corner sent out by their mother to beg ? I ’ ve found out where those mother live and in what surroundings . Children can ’ t remain child there ! At seven the child is vicious and a thief . Yet child , you know , are the image of Christ : ‘ theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. ’ He bade u honour and love them , they are the humanity of the future .... ” “ What ’ s to be done , what ’ s to be done ? ” repeated Sonia , weeping hysterically and wringing her hand . “ What ’ s to be done ? Break what must be broken , once for all , that ’ s all , and take the suffering on oneself . What , you don ’ t understand ? You ’ ll understand later .... Freedom and power , and above all , power ! Over all trembling creation and all the ant-heap ! ... That ’ s the goal , remember that ! That ’ s my farewell message . Perhaps it ’ s the last time I shall speak to you . If I don ’ t come to-morrow , you ’ ll hear of it all , and then remember these word . And some day later on , in year to come , you ’ ll understand perhaps what they meant . If I come to-morrow , I ’ ll tell you who killed Lizaveta .... Good-bye. ” Sonia started with terror . “ Why , do you know who killed her ? ” she asked , chilled with horror , looking wildly at him . “ I know and will tell ... you , only you . I have chosen you out . I ’ m not coming to you to ask forgiveness , but simply to tell you . I chose you out long ago to hear this , when your father talked of you and when Lizaveta wa alive , I thought of it . Good-bye , don ’ t shake hand . To-morrow ! ” He went out . Sonia gazed at him a at a madman . But she herself wa like one insane and felt it . Her head wa going round . “ Good heaven , how doe he know who killed Lizaveta ? What did those word mean ? It ’ s awful ! ” But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter her head , not for a moment ! “ Oh , he must be terribly unhappy ! ... He ha abandoned his mother and sister .... What for ? What ha happened ? And what had he in his mind ? What did he say to her ? He had kissed her foot and said ... said ( yes , he had said it clearly ) that he could not live without her .... Oh , merciful heaven ! ” Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious . She jumped up from time to time , wept and wrung her hand , then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka , Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta , of reading the gospel and him ... him with pale face , with burning eye ... kissing her foot , weeping . On the other side of the door on the right , which divided Sonia ’ s room from Madame Resslich ’ s flat , wa a room which had long stood empty . A card wa fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the window over the canal advertising it to let . Sonia had long been accustomed to the room ’ s being uninhabited . But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been standing , listening at the door of the empty room . When Raskolnikov went out he stood still , thought a moment , went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one , brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to Sonia ’ s room . The conversation had struck him a interesting and remarkable , and he had greatly enjoyed it -- so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future , to-morrow , for instance , have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour , but might listen in comfort . CHAPTER V When next morning at eleven o ’ clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal cause and sent his name in to Porfiry Petrovitch , he wa surprised at being kept waiting so long : it wa at least ten minute before he wa summoned . He had expected that they would pounce upon him . But he stood in the waiting-room , and people , who apparently had nothing to do with him , were continually passing to and fro before him . In the next room which looked like an office , several clerk were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be . He looked uneasily and suspiciously about him to see whether there wa not some guard , some mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape . But there wa nothing of the sort : he saw only the face of clerk absorbed in petty detail , then other people , no one seemed to have any concern with him . He might go where he liked for them . The conviction grew stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday , that phantom sprung out of the earth , had seen everything , they would not have let him stand and wait like that . And would they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven ? Either the man had not yet given information , or ... or simply he knew nothing , had seen nothing ( and how could he have seen anything ? ) and so all that had happened to him the day before wa again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination . This conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before , in the midst of all his alarm and despair . Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict , he wa suddenly aware that he wa trembling -- and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he wa trembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch . What he dreaded above all wa meeting that man again ; he hated him with an intense , unmitigated hatred and wa afraid his hatred might betray him . His indignation wa such that he ceased trembling at once ; he made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep a silent a possible , to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained nerve . At that moment he wa summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch . He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study . His study wa a room neither large nor small , furnished with a large writing-table , that stood before a sofa , upholstered in checked material , a bureau , a bookcase in the corner and several chair -- all government furniture , of polished yellow wood . In the further wall there wa a closed door , beyond it there were no doubt other room . On Raskolnikov ’ s entrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in and they remained alone . He met his visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air , and it wa only after a few minute that Raskolnikov saw sign of a certain awkwardness in him , a though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret . “ Ah , my dear fellow ! Here you are ... in our domain ” ... began Porfiry , holding out both hand to him . “ Come , sit down , old man ... or perhaps you don ’ t like to be called ‘ my dear fellow ’ and ‘ old man ! ’ -- _tout court_ ? Please don ’ t think it too familiar .... Here , on the sofa. ” Raskolnikov sat down , keeping his eye fixed on him . “ In our domain , ” the apology for familiarity , the French phrase _tout court_ , were all characteristic sign . “ He held out both hand to me , but he did not give me one -- he drew it back in time , ” struck him suspiciously . Both were watching each other , but when their eye met , quick a lightning they looked away . “ I brought you this paper ... about the watch . Here it is . Is it all right or shall I copy it again ? ” “ What ? A paper ? Yes , yes , don ’ t be uneasy , it ’ s all right , ” Porfiry Petrovitch said a though in haste , and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it . “ Yes , it ’ s all right . Nothing more is needed , ” he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table . A minute later when he wa talking of something else he took it from the table and put it on his bureau . “ I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me ... formally ... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman ? ” Raskolnikov wa beginning again . “ Why did I put in ‘ I believe ’ ” passed through his mind in a flash . “ Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘ _I believe_ ’ ? ” came in a second flash . And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry , at the first word , at the first look , had grown in an instant to monstrous proportion , and that this wa fearfully dangerous . His nerve were quivering , his emotion wa increasing . “ It ’ s bad , it ’ s bad ! I shall say too much again. ” “ Yes , yes , yes ! There ’ s no hurry , there ’ s no hurry , ” muttered Porfiry Petrovitch , moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim , a it were making dash towards the window , the bureau and the table , at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov ’ s suspicious glance , then again standing still and looking him straight in the face . His fat round little figure looked very strange , like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back . “ We ’ ve plenty of time . Do you smoke ? have you your own ? Here , a cigarette ! ” he went on , offering his visitor a cigarette . “ You know I am receiving you here , but my own quarter are through there , you know , my government quarter . But I am living outside for the time , I had to have some repair done here . It ’ s almost finished now .... Government quarter , you know , are a capital thing . Eh , what do you think ? ” “ Yes , a capital thing , ” answered Raskolnikov , looking at him almost ironically . “ A capital thing , a capital thing , ” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch , a though he had just thought of something quite different . “ Yes , a capital thing , ” he almost shouted at last , suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two step from him . This stupid repetition wa too incongruous in it ineptitude with the serious , brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor . But this stirred Raskolnikov ’ s spleen more than ever and he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge . “ Tell me , please , ” he asked suddenly , looking almost insolently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence . “ I believe it ’ s a sort of legal rule , a sort of legal tradition -- for all investigating lawyer -- to begin their attack from afar , with a trivial , or at least an irrelevant subject , so a to encourage , or rather , to divert the man they are cross-examining , to disarm his caution and then all at once to give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question . Isn ’ t that so ? It ’ s a sacred tradition , mentioned , I fancy , in all the manual of the art ? ” “ Yes , yes .... Why , do you imagine that wa why I spoke about government quarter ... eh ? ” And a he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eye and winked ; a good-humoured , crafty look passed over his face . The wrinkle on his forehead were smoothed out , his eye contracted , his feature broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh , shaking all over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face . The latter forced himself to laugh , too , but when Porfiry , seeing that he wa laughing , broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson , Raskolnikov ’ s repulsion overcame all precaution ; he left off laughing , scowled and stared with hatred at Porfiry , keeping his eye fixed on him while his intentionally prolonged laughter lasted . There wa lack of precaution on both side , however , for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor ’ s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it . The latter fact wa very significant in Raskolnikov ’ s eye : he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either , but that he , Raskolnikov , had perhaps fallen into a trap ; that there must be something , some motive here unknown to him ; that , perhaps , everything wa in readiness and in another moment would break upon him ... He went straight to the point at once , rose from his seat and took his cap . “ Porfiry Petrovitch , ” he began resolutely , though with considerable irritation , “ yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you for some inquiry ” ( he laid special stress on the word “ inquiry ” ) . “ I have come and if you have anything to ask me , ask it , and if not , allow me to withdraw . I have no time to spare .... I have to be at the funeral of that man who wa run over , of whom you ... know also , ” he added , feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his anger . “ I am sick of it all , do you hear ? and have long been . It ’ s partly what made me ill . In short , ” he shouted , feeling that the phrase about his illness wa still more out of place , “ in short , kindly examine me or let me go , at once . And if you must examine me , do so in the proper form ! I will not allow you to do so otherwise , and so meanwhile , good-bye , a we have evidently nothing to keep u now. ” “ Good heaven ! What do you mean ? What shall I question you about ? ” cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone , instantly leaving off laughing . “ Please don ’ t disturb yourself , ” he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down . “ There ’ s no hurry , there ’ s no hurry , it ’ s all nonsense . Oh , no , I ’ m very glad you ’ ve come to see me at last ... I look upon you simply a a visitor . And a for my confounded laughter , please excuse it , Rodion Romanovitch . Rodion Romanovitch ? That is your name ? ... It ’ s my nerve , you tickled me so with your witty observation ; I assure you , sometimes I shake with laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time .... I ’ m often afraid of an attack of paralysis . Do sit down . Please do , or I shall think you are angry ... ” Raskolnikov did not speak ; he listened , watching him , still frowning angrily . He did sit down , but still held his cap . “ I must tell you one thing about myself , my dear Rodion Romanovitch , ” Porfiry Petrovitch continued , moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor ’ s eye . “ You see , I ’ m a bachelor , a man of no consequence and not used to society ; besides , I have nothing before me , I ’ m set , I ’ m running to seed and ... and have you noticed , Rodion Romanovitch , that in our Petersburg circle , if two clever men meet who are not intimate , but respect each other , like you and me , it take them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation -- they are dumb , they sit opposite each other and feel awkward . Everyone ha subject of conversation , lady for instance ... people in high society always have their subject of conversation , _c ’ est de rigueur_ , but people of the middle sort like u , thinking people that is , are always tongue-tied and awkward . What is the reason of it ? Whether it is the lack of public interest , or whether it is we are so honest we don ’ t want to deceive one another , I don ’ t know . What do you think ? Do put down your cap , it look a if you were just going , it make me uncomfortable ... I am so delighted ... ” Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry Petrovitch . “ Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble ? ” “ I can ’ t offer you coffee here ; but why not spend five minute with a friend ? ” Porfiry pattered on , “ and you know all these official duty ... please don ’ t mind my running up and down , excuse it , my dear fellow , I am very much afraid of offending you , but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me . I ’ m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minute ... I suffer from my sedentary life ... I always intend to join a gymnasium ; they say that official of all rank , even Privy Councillors , may be seen skipping gaily there ; there you have it , modern science ... yes , yes .... But a for my duty here , inquiry and all such formality ... you mentioned inquiry yourself just now ... I assure you these interrogation are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated .... You made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily. ” ( Raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind . ) “ One get into a muddle ! A regular muddle ! One keep harping on the same note , like a drum ! There is to be a reform and we shall be called by a different name , at least , he-he-he ! And a for our legal tradition , a you so wittily called it , I thoroughly agree with you . Every prisoner on trial , even the rudest peasant , know that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant question ( a you so happily put it ) and then deal him a knock-down blow , he-he-he ! -- your felicitous comparison , he-he ! So you really imagined that I meant by ‘ government quarter ’ ... he-he ! You are an ironical person . Come . I won ’ t go on ! Ah , by the way , yes ! One word lead to another . You spoke of formality just now , apropos of the inquiry , you know . But what ’ s the use of formality ? In many case it ’ s nonsense . Sometimes one ha a friendly chat and get a good deal more out of it . One can always fall back on formality , allow me to assure you . And after all , what doe it amount to ? An examining lawyer can not be bounded by formality at every step . The work of investigation is , so to speak , a free art in it own way , he-he-he ! ” Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment . He had simply babbled on uttering empty phrase , letting slip a few enigmatic word and again reverting to incoherence . He wa almost running about the room , moving his fat little leg quicker and quicker , looking at the ground , with his right hand behind his back , while with his left making gesticulation that were extraordinarily incongruous with his word . Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that a he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the door , a though he were listening . “ Is he expecting anything ? ” “ You are certainly quite right about it , ” Porfiry began gaily , looking with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov ( which startled him and instantly put him on his guard ) ; “ certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal form , he-he ! Some of these elaborate psychological method are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless , if one adheres too closely to the form . Yes ... I am talking of form again . Well , if I recognise , or more strictly speaking , if I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me ... you ’ re reading for the law , of course , Rodion Romanovitch ? ” “ Yes , I wa ... ” “ Well , then it is a precedent for you for the future -- though don ’ t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the article you publish about crime ! No , I simply make bold to state it by way of fact , if I took this man or that for a criminal , why , I ask , should I worry him prematurely , even though I had evidence against him ? In one case I may be bound , for instance , to arrest a man at once , but another may be in quite a different position , you know , so why shouldn ’ t I let him walk about the town a bit ? he-he-he ! But I see you don ’ t quite understand , so I ’ ll give you a clearer example . If I put him in prison too soon , I may very likely give him , so to speak , moral support , he-he ! You ’ re laughing ? ” Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing . He wa sitting with compressed lip , his feverish eye fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch ’ s . “ Yet that is the case , with some type especially , for men are so different . You say ‘ evidence ’ . Well , there may be evidence . But evidence , you know , can generally be taken two way . I am an examining lawyer and a weak man , I confess it . I should like to make a proof , so to say , mathematically clear . I should like to make a chain of evidence such a twice two are four , it ought to be a direct , irrefutable proof ! And if I shut him up too soon -- even though I might be convinced _he_ wa the man , I should very likely be depriving myself of the mean of getting further evidence against him . And how ? By giving him , so to speak , a definite position , I shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest , so that he will retreat into his shell . They say that at Sevastopol , soon after Alma , the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once . But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege , they were delighted , I am told and reassured , for the thing would drag on for two month at least . You ’ re laughing , you don ’ t believe me again ? Of course , you ’ re right , too . You ’ re right , you ’ re right . These are special case , I admit . But you must observe this , my dear Rodion Romanovitch , the general case , the case for which all legal form and rule are intended , for which they are calculated and laid down in book , doe not exist at all , for the reason that every case , every crime , for instance , so soon a it actually occurs , at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that ’ s gone before . Very comic case of that sort sometimes occur . If I leave one man quite alone , if I don ’ t touch him and don ’ t worry him , but let him know or at least suspect every moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night , and if he is in continual suspicion and terror , he ’ ll be bound to lose his head . He ’ ll come of himself , or maybe do something which will make it a plain a twice two are four -- it ’ s delightful . It may be so with a simple peasant , but with one of our sort , an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side , it ’ s a dead certainty . For , my dear fellow , it ’ s a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated . And then there are nerve , there are nerve , you have overlooked them ! Why , they are all sick , nervous and irritable ! ... And then how they all suffer from spleen ! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for u . And it ’ s no anxiety to me , his running about the town free ! Let him , let him walk about for a bit ! I know well enough that I ’ ve caught him and that he won ’ t escape me . Where could he escape to , he-he ? Abroad , perhaps ? A Pole will escape abroad , but not here , especially a I am watching and have taken measure . Will he escape into the depth of the country perhaps ? But you know , peasant live there , real rude Russian peasant . A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such stranger a our peasant . He-he ! But that ’ s all nonsense , and on the surface . It ’ s not merely that he ha nowhere to run to , he is _psychologically_ unable to escape me , he-he ! What an expression ! Through a law of nature he can ’ t escape me if he had anywhere to go . Have you seen a butterfly round a candle ? That ’ s how he will keep circling and circling round me . Freedom will lose it attraction . He ’ ll begin to brood , he ’ ll weave a tangle round himself , he ’ ll worry himself to death ! What ’ s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof -- if I only give him long enough interval .... And he ’ ll keep circling round me , getting nearer and nearer and then -- flop ! He ’ ll fly straight into my mouth and I ’ ll swallow him , and that will be very amusing , he-he-he ! You don ’ t believe me ? ” Raskolnikov made no reply ; he sat pale and motionless , still gazing with the same intensity into Porfiry ’ s face . “ It ’ s a lesson , ” he thought , turning cold . “ This is beyond the cat playing with a mouse , like yesterday . He can ’ t be showing off his power with no motive ... prompting me ; he is far too clever for that ... he must have another object . What is it ? It ’ s all nonsense , my friend , you are pretending , to scare me ! You ’ ve no proof and the man I saw had no real existence . You simply want to make me lose my head , to work me up beforehand and so to crush me . But you are wrong , you won ’ t do it ! But why give me such a hint ? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerve ? No , my friend , you are wrong , you won ’ t do it even though you have some trap for me ... let u see what you have in store for me. ” And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal . At time he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him . This anger wa what he dreaded from the beginning . He felt that his parched lip were flecked with foam , his heart wa throbbing . But he wa still determined not to speak till the right moment . He realised that this wa the best policy in his position , because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely . Anyhow , this wa what he hoped for . “ No , I see you don ’ t believe me , you think I am playing a harmless joke on you , ” Porfiry began again , getting more and more lively , chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room . “ And to be sure you ’ re right : God ha given me a figure that can awaken none but comic idea in other people ; a buffoon ; but let me tell you , and I repeat it , excuse an old man , my dear Rodion Romanovitch , you are a man still young , so to say , in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything , like all young people . Playful wit and abstract argument fascinate you and that ’ s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_ , a far a I can judge of military matter , that is : on paper they ’ d beaten Napoleon and taken him prisoner , and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion , but look you , General Mack surrendered with all his army , he-he-he ! I see , I see , Rodion Romanovitch , you are laughing at a civilian like me , taking example out of military history ! But I can ’ t help it , it ’ s my weakness . I am fond of military science . And I ’ m ever so fond of reading all military history . I ’ ve certainly missed my proper career . I ought to have been in the army , upon my word I ought . I shouldn ’ t have been a Napoleon , but I might have been a major , he-he ! Well , I ’ ll tell you the whole truth , my dear fellow , about this _special case_ , I mean : actual fact and a man ’ s temperament , my dear sir , are weighty matter and it ’ s astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation ! I -- listen to an old man -- am speaking seriously , Rodion Romanovitch ” ( a he said this Porfiry Petrovitch , who wa scarcely five-and-thirty , actually seemed to have grown old ; even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together ) “ Moreover , I ’ m a candid man ... am I a candid man or not ? What do you say ? I fancy I really am : I tell you these thing for nothing and don ’ t even expect a reward for it , he-he ! Well , to proceed , wit in my opinion is a splendid thing , it is , so to say , an adornment of nature and a consolation of life , and what trick it can play ! So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is , especially when he ’ s liable to be carried away by his own fancy , too , for you know he is a man after all ! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal ’ s temperament , worse luck for him ! But young people carried away by their own wit don ’ t think of that ‘ when they overstep all obstacle , ’ a you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday . He will lie -- that is , the man who is a _special case_ , the incognito , and he will lie well , in the cleverest fashion ; you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruit of his wit , but at the most interesting , the most flagrant moment he will faint . Of course there may be illness and a stuffy room a well , but anyway ! Anyway he ’ s given u the idea ! He lied incomparably , but he didn ’ t reckon on his temperament . That ’ s what betrays him ! Another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspect him , he will turn pale a it were on purpose to mislead , but his paleness will be _too natural_ , too much like the real thing , again he ha given u an idea ! Though his questioner may be deceived at first , he will think differently next day if he is not a fool , and , of course , it is like that at every step ! He put himself forward where he is not wanted , speaks continually when he ought to keep silent , brings in all sort of allegorical allusion , he-he ! Comes and asks why didn ’ t you take me long ago ? he-he-he ! And that can happen , you know , with the cleverest man , the psychologist , the literary man . The temperament reflects everything like a mirror ! Gaze into it and admire what you see ! But why are you so pale , Rodion Romanovitch ? Is the room stuffy ? Shall I open the window ? ” “ Oh , don ’ t trouble , please , ” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke into a laugh . “ Please don ’ t trouble. ” Porfiry stood facing him , paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed . Raskolnikov got up from the sofa , abruptly checking his hysterical laughter . “ Porfiry Petrovitch , ” he began , speaking loudly and distinctly , though his leg trembled and he could scarcely stand . “ I see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister Lizaveta . Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this . If you find that you have a right to prosecute me legally , to arrest me , then prosecute me , arrest me . But I will not let myself be jeered at to my face and worried ... ” His lip trembled , his eye glowed with fury and he could not restrain his voice . “ I won ’ t allow it ! ” he shouted , bringing his fist down on the table . “ Do you hear that , Porfiry Petrovitch ? I won ’ t allow it. ” “ Good heaven ! What doe it mean ? ” cried Porfiry Petrovitch , apparently quite frightened . “ Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow , what is the matter with you ? ” “ I won ’ t allow it , ” Raskolnikov shouted again . “ Hush , my dear man ! They ’ ll hear and come in . Just think , what could we say to them ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror , bringing his face close to Raskolnikov ’ s . “ I won ’ t allow it , I won ’ t allow it , ” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically , but he too spoke in a sudden whisper . Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window . “ Some fresh air ! And you must have some water , my dear fellow . You ’ re ill ! ” and he wa running to the door to call for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner . “ Come , drink a little , ” he whispered , rushing up to him with the decanter . “ It will be sure to do you good. ” Porfiry Petrovitch ’ s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov wa silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity . He did not take the water , however . “ Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow , you ’ ll drive yourself out of your mind , I assure you , ach , ach ! Have some water , do drink a little. ” He forced him to take the glass . Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his lip , but set it on the table again with disgust . “ Yes , you ’ ve had a little attack ! You ’ ll bring back your illness again , my dear fellow , ” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy , though he still looked rather disconcerted . “ Good heaven , you must take more care of yourself ! Dmitri Prokofitch wa here , came to see me yesterday -- I know , I know , I ’ ve a nasty , ironical temper , but what they made of it ! ... Good heaven , he came yesterday after you ’ d been . We dined and he talked and talked away , and I could only throw up my hand in despair ! Did he come from you ? But do sit down , for mercy ’ s sake , sit down ! ” “ No , not from me , but I knew he went to you and why he went , ” Raskolnikov answered sharply . “ You knew ? ” “ I knew . What of it ? ” “ Why this , Rodion Romanovitch , that I know more than that about you ; I know about everything . I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night when it wa dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood , so that the workman and the porter did not know what to make of it . Yes , I understand your state of mind at that time ... but you ’ ll drive yourself mad like that , upon my word ! You ’ ll lose your head ! You ’ re full of generous indignation at the wrong you ’ ve received , first from destiny , and then from the police officer , and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all , because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness . That ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? I have guessed how you feel , haven ’ t I ? Only in that way you ’ ll lose your head and Razumihin ’ s , too ; he ’ s too _good_ a man for such a position , you must know that . You are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him ... I ’ ll tell you about it when you are more yourself .... But do sit down , for goodness ’ sake . Please rest , you look shocking , do sit down. ” Raskolnikov sat down ; he no longer shivered , he wa hot all over . In amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened a he looked after him with friendly solicitude . But he did not believe a word he said , though he felt a strange inclination to believe . Porfiry ’ s unexpected word about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him . “ How can it be , he know about the flat then , ” he thought suddenly , “ and he tell it me himself ! ” “ Yes , in our legal practice there wa a case almost exactly similar , a case of morbid psychology , ” Porfiry went on quickly . “ A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up ! It wa a regular hallucination ; he brought forward fact , he imposed upon everyone and why ? He had been partly , but only partly , unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderer the opportunity , he sank into dejection , it got on his mind and turned his brain , he began imagining thing and he persuaded himself that he wa the murderer . But at last the High Court of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow wa acquitted and put under proper care . Thanks to the Court of Appeal ! Tut-tut-tut ! Why , my dear fellow , you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerve , to go ringing bell at night and asking about blood ! I ’ ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice . A man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry . Just the same with bell-ringing .... It ’ s all illness , Rodion Romanovitch ! You have begun to neglect your illness . You should consult an experienced doctor , what ’ s the good of that fat fellow ? You are lightheaded ! You were delirious when you did all this ! ” For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round . “ Is it possible , is it possible , ” flashed through his mind , “ that he is still lying ? He can ’ t be , he can ’ t be. ” He rejected that idea , feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him , feeling that that fury might drive him mad . “ I wa not delirious . I knew what I wa doing , ” he cried , straining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry ’ s game , “ I wa quite myself , do you hear ? ” “ Yes , I hear and understand . You said yesterday you were not delirious , you were particularly emphatic about it ! I understand all you can tell me ! A-ach ! ... Listen , Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow . If you were actually a criminal , or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business , would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculty ? And so emphatically and persistently ? Would it be possible ? Quite impossible , to my thinking . If you had anything on your conscience , you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious . That ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? ” There wa a note of slyness in this inquiry . Raskolnikov drew back on the sofa a Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at him . “ Another thing about Razumihin -- you certainly ought to have said that he came of his own accord , to have concealed your part in it ! But you don ’ t conceal it ! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation. ” Raskolnikov had not done so . A chill went down his back . “ You keep telling lie , ” he said slowly and weakly , twisting his lip into a sickly smile , “ you are trying again to show that you know all my game , that you know all I shall say beforehand , ” he said , conscious himself that he wa not weighing his word a he ought . “ You want to frighten me ... or you are simply laughing at me ... ” He still stared at him a he said this and again there wa a light of intense hatred in his eye . “ You keep lying , ” he said . “ You know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth a nearly a possible ... to conceal a little a possible . I don ’ t believe you ! ” “ What a wily person you are ! ” Porfiry tittered , “ there ’ s no catching you ; you ’ ve a perfect monomania . So you don ’ t believe me ? But still you do believe me , you believe a quarter ; I ’ ll soon make you believe the whole , because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good. ” Raskolnikov ’ s lip trembled . “ Yes , I do , ” went on Porfiry , touching Raskolnikov ’ s arm genially , “ you must take care of your illness . Besides , your mother and sister are here now ; you must think of them . You must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them ... ” “ What ha that to do with you ? How do you know it ? What concern is it of yours ? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it ? ” “ Good heaven ! Why , I learnt it all from you yourself ! You don ’ t notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything . From Razumihin , too , I learnt a number of interesting detail yesterday . No , you interrupted me , but I must tell you that , for all your wit , your suspiciousness make you lose the common-sense view of thing . To return to bell-ringing , for instance . I , an examining lawyer , have betrayed a precious thing like that , a real fact ( for it is a fact worth having ) , and you see nothing in it ! Why , if I had the slightest suspicion of you , should I have acted like that ? No , I should first have disarmed your suspicion and not let you see I knew of that fact , should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow ( your expression ) saying : ‘ And what were you doing , sir , pray , at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman ’ s flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood ? And why did you invite the porter to go with you to the police station , to the lieutenant ? ’ That ’ s how I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you . I ought to have taken your evidence in due form , searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you , too ... so I have no suspicion of you , since I have not done that ! But you can ’ t look at it normally and you see nothing , I say again. ” Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to perceive it . “ You are lying all the while , ” he cried , “ I don ’ t know your object , but you are lying . You did not speak like that just now and I can not be mistaken ! ” “ I am lying ? ” Porfiry repeated , apparently incensed , but preserving a good-humoured and ironical face , a though he were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov ’ s opinion of him . “ I am lying ... but how did I treat you just now , I , the examining lawyer ? Prompting you and giving you every mean for your defence ; illness , I said , delirium , injury , melancholy and the police officer and all the rest of it ? Ah ! He-he-he ! Though , indeed , all those psychological mean of defence are not very reliable and cut both way : illness , delirium , I don ’ t remember -- that ’ s all right , but why , my good sir , in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusion and not by any others ? There may have been others , eh ? He-he-he ! ” Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him . “ Briefly , ” he said loudly and imperiously , rising to his foot and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little , “ briefly , I want to know , do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not ? Tell me , Porfiry Petrovitch , tell me once for all and make haste ! ” “ What a business I ’ m having with you ! ” cried Porfiry with a perfectly good-humoured , sly and composed face . “ And why do you want to know , why do you want to know so much , since they haven ’ t begun to worry you ? Why , you are like a child asking for match ! And why are you so uneasy ? Why do you force yourself upon u , eh ? He-he-he ! ” “ I repeat , ” Raskolnikov cried furiously , “ that I can ’ t put up with it ! ” “ With what ? Uncertainty ? ” interrupted Porfiry . “ Don ’ t jeer at me ! I won ’ t have it ! I tell you I won ’ t have it . I can ’ t and I won ’ t , do you hear , do you hear ? ” he shouted , bringing his fist down on the table again . “ Hush ! Hush ! They ’ ll overhear ! I warn you seriously , take care of yourself . I am not joking , ” Porfiry whispered , but this time there wa not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face . Now he wa peremptory , stern , frowning and for once laying aside all mystification . But this wa only for an instant . Raskolnikov , bewildered , suddenly fell into actual frenzy , but , strange to say , he again obeyed the command to speak quietly , though he wa in a perfect paroxysm of fury . “ I will not allow myself to be tortured , ” he whispered , instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought . “ Arrest me , search me , but kindly act in due form and don ’ t play with me ! Don ’ t dare ! ” “ Don ’ t worry about the form , ” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile , a it were , gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov . “ I invited you to see me quite in a friendly way. ” “ I don ’ t want your friendship and I spit on it ! Do you hear ? And , here , I take my cap and go . What will you say now if you mean to arrest me ? ” He took up his cap and went to the door . “ And won ’ t you see my little surprise ? ” chuckled Porfiry , again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door . He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened Raskolnikov . “ What surprise ? ” he asked , standing still and looking at Porfiry in alarm . “ My little surprise , it ’ s sitting there behind the door , he-he-he ! ” ( He pointed to the locked door . ) “ I locked him in that he should not escape. ” “ What is it ? Where ? What ? ... ” Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it , but it wa locked . “ It ’ s locked , here is the key ! ” And he brought a key out of his pocket . “ You are lying , ” roared Raskolnikov without restraint , “ you lie , you damned punchinello ! ” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other door , not at all alarmed . “ I understand it all ! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray myself to you ... ” “ Why , you could not betray yourself any further , my dear Rodion Romanovitch . You are in a passion . Don ’ t shout , I shall call the clerks. ” “ You are lying ! Call the clerk ! You knew I wa ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself , that wa your object ! Produce your fact ! I understand it all . You ’ ve no evidence , you have only wretched rubbishly suspicion like Zametov ’ s ! You knew my character , you wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priest and deputy .... Are you waiting for them ? eh ! What are you waiting for ? Where are they ? Produce them ? ” “ Why deputy , my good man ? What thing people will imagine ! And to do so would not be acting in form a you say , you don ’ t know the business , my dear fellow .... And there ’ s no escaping form , a you see , ” Porfiry muttered , listening at the door through which a noise could be heard . “ Ah , they ’ re coming , ” cried Raskolnikov . “ You ’ ve sent for them ! You expected them ! Well , produce them all : your deputy , your witness , what you like ! ... I am ready ! ” But at this moment a strange incident occurred , something so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview . CHAPTER VI When he remembered the scene afterwards , this is how Raskolnikov saw it . The noise behind the door increased , and suddenly the door wa opened a little . “ What is it ? ” cried Porfiry Petrovitch , annoyed . “ Why , I gave order ... ” For an instant there wa no answer , but it wa evident that there were several person at the door , and that they were apparently pushing somebody back . “ What is it ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated , uneasily . “ The prisoner Nikolay ha been brought , ” someone answered . “ He is not wanted ! Take him away ! Let him wait ! What ’ s he doing here ? How irregular ! ” cried Porfiry , rushing to the door . “ But he ... ” began the same voice , and suddenly ceased . Two second , not more , were spent in actual struggle , then someone gave a violent shove , and then a man , very pale , strode into the room . This man ’ s appearance wa at first sight very strange . He stared straight before him , a though seeing nothing . There wa a determined gleam in his eye ; at the same time there wa a deathly pallor in his face , a though he were being led to the scaffold . His white lip were faintly twitching . He wa dressed like a workman and wa of medium height , very young , slim , his hair cut in round crop , with thin spare feature . The man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder ; he wa a warder ; but Nikolay pulled his arm away . Several person crowded inquisitively into the doorway . Some of them tried to get in . All this took place almost instantaneously . “ Go away , it ’ s too soon ! Wait till you are sent for ! ... Why have you brought him so soon ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered , extremely annoyed , and a it were thrown out of his reckoning . But Nikolay suddenly knelt down . “ What ’ s the matter ? ” cried Porfiry , surprised . “ I am guilty ! Mine is the sin ! I am the murderer , ” Nikolay articulated suddenly , rather breathless , but speaking fairly loudly . For ten second there wa silence a though all had been struck dumb ; even the warder stepped back , mechanically retreated to the door , and stood immovable . “ What is it ? ” cried Porfiry Petrovitch , recovering from his momentary stupefaction . “ I ... am the murderer , ” repeated Nikolay , after a brief pause . “ What ... you ... what ... whom did you kill ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch wa obviously bewildered . Nikolay again wa silent for a moment . “ Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna , I ... killed ... with an axe . Darkness came over me , ” he added suddenly , and wa again silent . He still remained on his knee . Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some moment a though meditating , but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectator . They instantly vanished and closed the door . Then he looked towards Raskolnikov , who wa standing in the corner , staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him , but stopped short , looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay , and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter . “ You ’ re in too great a hurry , ” he shouted at him , almost angrily . “ I didn ’ t ask you what came over you .... Speak , did you kill them ? ” “ I am the murderer .... I want to give evidence , ” Nikolay pronounced . “ Ach ! What did you kill them with ? ” “ An axe . I had it ready. ” “ Ach , he is in a hurry ! Alone ? ” Nikolay did not understand the question . “ Did you do it alone ? ” “ Yes , alone . And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it. ” “ Don ’ t be in a hurry about Mitka ! A-ach ! How wa it you ran downstairs like that at the time ? The porter met you both ! ” “ It wa to put them off the scent ... I ran after Mitka , ” Nikolay replied hurriedly , a though he had prepared the answer . “ I knew it ! ” cried Porfiry , with vexation . “ It ’ s not his own tale he is telling , ” he muttered a though to himself , and suddenly his eye rested on Raskolnikov again . He wa apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had forgotten Raskolnikov . He wa a little taken aback . “ My dear Rodion Romanovitch , excuse me ! ” he flew up to him , “ this won ’ t do ; I ’ m afraid you must go ... it ’ s no good your staying ... I will ... you see , what a surprise ! ... Good-bye ! ” And taking him by the arm , he showed him to the door . “ I suppose you didn ’ t expect it ? ” said Raskolnikov who , though he had not yet fully grasped the situation , had regained his courage . “ You did not expect it either , my friend . See how your hand is trembling ! He-he ! ” “ You ’ re trembling , too , Porfiry Petrovitch ! ” “ Yes , I am ; I didn ’ t expect it. ” They were already at the door ; Porfiry wa impatient for Raskolnikov to be gone . “ And your little surprise , aren ’ t you going to show it to me ? ” Raskolnikov said , sarcastically . “ Why , his teeth are chattering a he asks , he-he ! You are an ironical person ! Come , till we meet ! ” “ I believe we can say _good-bye_ ! ” “ That ’ s in God ’ s hand , ” muttered Porfiry , with an unnatural smile . As he walked through the office , Raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him . Among them he saw the two porter from _the_ house , whom he had invited that night to the police station . They stood there waiting . But he wa no sooner on the stair than he heard the voice of Porfiry Petrovitch behind him . Turning round , he saw the latter running after him , out of breath . “ One word , Rodion Romanovitch ; a to all the rest , it ’ s in God ’ s hand , but a a matter of form there are some question I shall have to ask you ... so we shall meet again , shan ’ t we ? ” And Porfiry stood still , facing him with a smile . “ Shan ’ t we ? ” he added again . He seemed to want to say something more , but could not speak out . “ You must forgive me , Porfiry Petrovitch , for what ha just passed ... I lost my temper , ” began Raskolnikov , who had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness . “ Don ’ t mention it , don ’ t mention it , ” Porfiry replied , almost gleefully . “ I myself , too ... I have a wicked temper , I admit it ! But we shall meet again . If it ’ s God ’ s will , we may see a great deal of one another. ” “ And will get to know each other through and through ? ” added Raskolnikov . “ Yes ; know each other through and through , ” assented Porfiry Petrovitch , and he screwed up his eye , looking earnestly at Raskolnikov . “ Now you ’ re going to a birthday party ? ” “ To a funeral. ” “ Of course , the funeral ! Take care of yourself , and get well. ” “ I don ’ t know what to wish you , ” said Raskolnikov , who had begun to descend the stair , but looked back again . “ I should like to wish you success , but your office is such a comical one. ” “ Why comical ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go , but he seemed to prick up his ear at this . “ Why , how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay psychologically , after your fashion , till he confessed ! You must have been at him day and night , proving to him that he wa the murderer , and now that he ha confessed , you ’ ll begin vivisecting him again . ‘ You are lying , ’ you ’ ll say . ‘ You are not the murderer ! You can ’ t be ! It ’ s not your own tale you are telling ! ’ You must admit it ’ s a comical business ! ” “ He-he-he ! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it wa not his own tale he wa telling ? ” “ How could I help noticing it ! ” “ He-he ! You are quick-witted . You notice everything ! You ’ ve really a playful mind ! And you always fasten on the comic side ... he-he ! They say that wa the marked characteristic of Gogol , among the writers. ” “ Yes , of Gogol. ” “ Yes , of Gogol .... I shall look forward to meeting you. ” “ So shall I. ” Raskolnikov walked straight home . He wa so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa , trying to collect his thought . He did not attempt to think about Nikolay ; he wa stupefied ; he felt that his confession wa something inexplicable , amazing -- something beyond his understanding . But Nikolay ’ s confession wa an actual fact . The consequence of this fact were clear to him at once , it falsehood could not fail to be discovered , and then they would be after him again . Till then , at least , he wa free and must do something for himself , for the danger wa imminent . But how imminent ? His position gradually became clear to him . Remembering , sketchily , the main outline of his recent scene with Porfiry , he could not help shuddering again with horror . Of course , he did not yet know all Porfiry ’ s aim , he could not see into all his calculation . But he had already partly shown his hand , and no one knew better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry ’ s “ lead ” had been for him . A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely , circumstantially . Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first glance seeing through him , Porfiry , though playing a bold game , wa bound to win . There ’ s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously , but no _facts_ had come to light a yet ; there wa nothing positive . But wa he taking a true view of the position ? Wasn ’ t he mistaken ? What had Porfiry been trying to get at ? Had he really some surprise prepared for him ? And what wa it ? Had he really been expecting something or not ? How would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of Nikolay ? Porfiry had shown almost all his card -- of course , he had risked something in showing them -- and if he had really had anything up his sleeve ( Raskolnikov reflected ) , he would have shown that , too . What wa that “ surprise ” ? Was it a joke ? Had it meant anything ? Could it have concealed anything like a fact , a piece of positive evidence ? His yesterday ’ s visitor ? What had become of him ? Where wa he to-day ? If Porfiry really had any evidence , it must be connected with him .... He sat on the sofa with his elbow on his knee and his face hidden in his hand . He wa still shivering nervously . At last he got up , took his cap , thought a minute , and went to the door . He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day , at least , he might consider himself out of danger . He had a sudden sense almost of joy ; he wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna ’ s . He would be too late for the funeral , of course , but he would be in time for the memorial dinner , and there at once he would see Sonia . He stood still , thought a moment , and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lip . “ To-day ! To-day , ” he repeated to himself . “ Yes , to-day ! So it must be .... ” But a he wa about to open the door , it began opening of itself . He started and moved back . The door opened gently and slowly , and there suddenly appeared a figure -- yesterday ’ s visitor _from underground_ . The man stood in the doorway , looked at Raskolnikov without speaking , and took a step forward into the room . He wa exactly the same a yesterday ; the same figure , the same dress , but there wa a great change in his face ; he looked dejected and sighed deeply . If he had only put his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have looked exactly like a peasant woman . “ What do you want ? ” asked Raskolnikov , numb with terror . The man wa still silent , but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground , touching it with his finger . “ What is it ? ” cried Raskolnikov . “ I have sinned , ” the man articulated softly . “ How ? ” “ By evil thoughts. ” They looked at one another . “ I wa vexed . When you came , perhaps in drink , and bade the porter go to the police station and asked about the blood , I wa vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken . I wa so vexed that I lost my sleep . And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you .... ” “ Who came ? ” Raskolnikov interrupted , instantly beginning to recollect . “ I did , I ’ ve wronged you. ” “ Then you come from that house ? ” “ I wa standing at the gate with them ... don ’ t you remember ? We have carried on our trade in that house for year past . We cure and prepare hide , we take work home ... most of all I wa vexed .... ” And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before Raskolnikov ’ s mind ; he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porter , woman among them . He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police-station . He could not recall the face of the speaker , and even now he did not recognise it , but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer .... So this wa the solution of yesterday ’ s horror . The most awful thought wa that he had been actually almost lost , had almost done for himself on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance . So this man could tell nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stain . So Porfiry , too , had nothing but that _delirium_ , no fact but this _psychology_ which _cuts both ways_ , nothing positive . So if no more fact come to light ( and they must not , they must not ! ) then ... then what can they do to him ? How can they convict him , even if they arrest him ? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before . “ Was it you who told Porfiry ... that I ’ d been there ? ” he cried , struck by a sudden idea . “ What Porfiry ? ” “ The head of the detective department ? ” “ Yes . The porter did not go there , but I went. ” “ To-day ? ” “ I got there two minute before you . And I heard , I heard it all , how he worried you. ” “ Where ? What ? When ? ” “ Why , in the next room . I wa sitting there all the time. ” “ What ? Why , then you were the surprise ? But how could it happen ? Upon my word ! ” “ I saw that the porter did not want to do what I said , ” began the man ; “ for it ’ s too late , said they , and maybe he ’ ll be angry that we did not come at the time . I wa vexed and I lost my sleep , and I began making inquiry . And finding out yesterday where to go , I went to-day . The first time I went he wasn ’ t there , when I came an hour later he couldn ’ t see me . I went the third time , and they showed me in . I informed him of everything , just a it happened , and he began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest . ‘ What do you scoundrel mean by it ? If I ’ d known about it I should have arrested him ! ’ Then he ran out , called somebody and began talking to him in the corner , then he turned to me , scolding and questioning me . He scolded me a great deal ; and I told him everything , and I told him that you didn ’ t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn ’ t recognise me . And he fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest , and getting angry and running about , and when you were announced he told me to go into the next room . ‘ Sit there a bit , ’ he said . ‘ Don ’ t move , whatever you may hear. ’ And he set a chair there for me and locked me in . ‘ Perhaps , ’ he said , ‘ I may call you. ’ And when Nikolay ’ d been brought he let me out a soon a you were gone . ‘ I shall send for you again and question you , ’ he said. ” “ And did he question Nikolay while you were there ? ” “ He got rid of me a he did of you , before he spoke to Nikolay. ” The man stood still , and again suddenly bowed down , touching the ground with his finger . “ Forgive me for my evil thought , and my slander. ” “ May God forgive you , ” answered Raskolnikov . And a he said this , the man bowed down again , but not to the ground , turned slowly and went out of the room . “ It all cut both way , now it all cut both way , ” repeated Raskolnikov , and he went out more confident than ever . “ Now we ’ ll make a fight for it , ” he said , with a malicious smile , a he went down the stair . His malice wa aimed at himself ; with shame and contempt he recollected his “ cowardice. ” PART V CHAPTER I The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and her mother brought sobering influence to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch . Intensely unpleasant a it wa , he wa forced little by little to accept a a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible . The black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night . When he got out of bed , Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the looking-glass . He wa afraid that he had jaundice . However his health seemed unimpaired so far , and looking at his noble , clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late , Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant wa positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and , perhaps , even a better one . But coming back to the sense of his present position , he turned aside and spat vigorously , which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov , the young friend with whom he wa staying . That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed , and at once set it down against his young friend ’ s account . He had set down a good many point against him of late . His anger wa redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday ’ s interview . That wa the second mistake he had made in temper , through impulsiveness and irritability .... Moreover , all that morning one unpleasantness followed another . He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate . He wa particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and wa being redecorated at his own expense ; the owner , a rich German tradesman , would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money , though Pyotr Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated . In the same way the upholsterer refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat . “ Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate hope . “ Can all that be really so irrevocably over ? Is it no use to make another effort ? ” The thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart . He endured anguish at that moment , and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it , Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish . “ It wa my mistake , too , not to have given them money , ” he thought , a he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov ’ s room , “ and why on earth wa I such a Jew ? It wa false economy ! I meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me a their providence , and look at them ! foo ! If I ’ d spent some fifteen hundred rouble on them for the trousseau and present , on knick-knacks , dressing-cases , jewellery , material , and all that sort of trash from Knopp ’ s and the English shop , my position would have been better and ... stronger ! They could not have refused me so easily ! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and present if they broke it off ; and they would find it hard to do it ! And their conscience would prick them : how can we dismiss a man who ha hitherto been so generous and delicate ? .... H ’ m ! I ’ ve made a blunder. ” And grinding his teeth again , Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a fool -- but not aloud , of course . He returned home , twice a irritated and angry a before . The preparation for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna ’ s excited his curiosity a he passed . He had heard about it the day before ; he fancied , indeed , that he had been invited , but absorbed in his own care he had paid no attention . Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who wa busy laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna wa away at the cemetery , he heard that the entertainment wa to be a great affair , that all the lodger had been invited , among them some who had not known the dead man , that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov wa invited in spite of his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna , that he , Pyotr Petrovitch , wa not only invited , but wa eagerly expected a he wa the most important of the lodger . Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness , and so she wa very busy with preparation and wa taking a positive pleasure in them ; she wa moreover dressed up to the nine , all in new black silk , and she wa proud of it . All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he went into his room , or rather Lebeziatnikov ’ s , somewhat thoughtful . He had learnt that Raskolnikov wa to be one of the guest . Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning . The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman wa strange , though perhaps natural . Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him . He had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from parsimony , though that had been perhaps his chief object . He had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch , who had once been his ward , a a leading young progressive who wa taking an important part in certain interesting circle , the doings of which were a legend in the province . It had impressed Pyotr Petrovitch . These powerful omniscient circle who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm . He had not , of course , been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant . He , like everyone , had heard that there were , especially in Petersburg , progressive of some sort , nihilist and so on , and , like many people , he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those word to an absurd degree . What for many year past he had feared more than anything wa _being shown up_ and this wa the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to Petersburg . He wa afraid of this a little child are sometimes panic-stricken . Some year before , when he wa just entering on his own career , he had come upon two case in which rather important personage in the province , patron of his , had been cruelly shown up . One instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble . For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the subject a soon a he reached Petersburg and , if necessary , to anticipate contingency by seeking the favour of “ our younger generation. ” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrase . He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch wa a commonplace simpleton , but that by no mean reassured Pyotr Petrovitch . Even if he had been certain that all the progressive were fool like him , it would not have allayed his uneasiness . All the doctrine , the idea , the system , with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him . He had his own object -- he simply wanted to find out at once what wa happening _here_ . Had these people any power or not ? Had he anything to fear from them ? Would they expose any enterprise of his ? And what precisely wa now the object of their attack ? Could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful ? Was this the thing to do or not ? Couldn ’ t he gain something through them ? In fact hundred of question presented themselves . Andrey Semyonovitch wa an anæmic , scrofulous little man , with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whisker of which he wa very proud . He wa a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eye . He wa rather soft-hearted , but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech , which had an absurd effect , incongruous with his little figure . He wa one of the lodger most respected by Amalia Ivanovna , for he did not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodging . Andrey Semyonovitch really wa rather stupid ; he attached himself to the cause of progress and “ our younger generation ” from enthusiasm . He wa one of the numerous and varied legion of dullard , of half-animate abortion , conceited , half-educated coxcomb , who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve , however sincerely . Though Lebeziatnikov wa so good-natured , he , too , wa beginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch . This happened on both side unconsciously . However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be , he began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch wa duping him and secretly despising him , and that “ he wa not the right sort of man. ” He had tried expounding to him the system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory , but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude . The fact wa he had begun instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov wa not merely a commonplace simpleton , but , perhaps , a liar , too , and that he had no connection of any consequence even in his own circle , but had simply picked thing up third-hand ; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own work of propaganda , for he wa in too great a muddle . A fine person he would be to show anyone up ! It must be noted , by the way , that Pyotr Petrovitch had during those ten day eagerly accepted the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch ; he had not protested , for instance , when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new “ commune , ” or to abstain from christening his future child , or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a month after marriage , and so on . Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his own praise that he did not disdain even such virtue when they were attributed to him . Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some five-per-cent bond and now he sat down to the table and counted over bundle of note . Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank note with indifference and even contempt . Nothing would have convinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money unmoved , and the latter , on his side , kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch wa capable of entertaining such an idea about him and wa , perhaps , glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them . He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable , though he , Andrey Semyonovitch , began enlarging on his favourite subject , the foundation of a new special “ commune. ” The brief remark that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between the clicking of the bead on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony . But the “ humane ” Andrey Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s ill-humour to his recent breach with Dounia and he wa burning with impatience to discourse on that theme . He had something progressive to say on the subject which might console his worthy friend and “ could not fail ” to promote his development . “ There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that ... at the widow ’ s , isn ’ t there ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly , interrupting Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage . “ Why , don ’ t you know ? Why , I wa telling you last night what I think about all such ceremony . And she invited you too , I heard . You were talking to her yesterday ... ” “ I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool , Raskolnikov . I wa surprised just now a I came through at the preparation there , the wine ! Several people are invited . It ’ s beyond everything ! ” continued Pyotr Petrovitch , who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation . “ What ? You say I am asked too ? When wa that ? I don ’ t remember . But I shan ’ t go . Why should I ? I only said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year ’ s salary a a destitute widow of a government clerk . I suppose she ha invited me on that account , hasn ’ t she ? He-he-he ! ” “ I don ’ t intend to go either , ” said Lebeziatnikov . “ I should think not , after giving her a thrashing ! You might well hesitate , he-he ! ” “ Who thrashed ? Whom ? ” cried Lebeziatnikov , flustered and blushing . “ Why , you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago . I heard so yesterday ... so that ’ s what your conviction amount to ... and the woman question , too , wasn ’ t quite sound , he-he-he ! ” and Pyotr Petrovitch , a though comforted , went back to clicking his bead . “ It ’ s all slander and nonsense ! ” cried Lebeziatnikov , who wa always afraid of allusion to the subject . “ It wa not like that at all , it wa quite different . You ’ ve heard it wrong ; it ’ s a libel . I wa simply defending myself . She rushed at me first with her nail , she pulled out all my whisker .... It ’ s permissable for anyone , I should hope , to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle , for it ’ s an act of despotism . What wa I to do ? I simply pushed her back. ” “ He-he-he ! ” Luzhin went on laughing maliciously . “ You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself .... But that ’ s nonsense and it ha nothing , nothing whatever to do with the woman question ! You don ’ t understand ; I used to think , indeed , that if woman are equal to men in all respect , even in strength ( a is maintained now ) there ought to be equality in that , too . Of course , I reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise , for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable ... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting . I am not so stupid ... though , of course , there is fighting ... there won ’ t be later , but at present there is ... confound it ! How muddled one get with you ! It ’ s not on that account that I am not going . I am not going on principle , not to take part in the revolting convention of memorial dinner , that ’ s why ! Though , of course , one might go to laugh at it .... I am sorry there won ’ t be any priest at it . I should certainly go if there were. ” “ Then you would sit down at another man ’ s table and insult it and those who invited you . Eh ? ” “ Certainly not insult , but protest . I should do it with a good object . I might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda . It ’ s a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly , perhaps , the better . I might drop a seed , an idea .... And something might grow up from that seed . How should I be insulting them ? They might be offended at first , but afterwards they ’ d see I ’ d done them a service . You know , Terebyeva ( who is in the community now ) wa blamed because when she left her family and ... devoted ... herself , she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn ’ t go on living conventionally and wa entering on a free marriage and it wa said that that wa too harsh , that she might have spared them and have written more kindly . I think that ’ s all nonsense and there ’ s no need of softness ; on the contrary , what ’ s wanted is protest . Varents had been married seven year , she abandoned her two child , she told her husband straight out in a letter : ‘ I have realised that I can not be happy with you . I can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by mean of the community . I have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing a community . I speak plainly because I consider it dishonest to deceive you . Do a you think best . Do not hope to get me back , you are too late . I hope you will be happy. ’ That ’ s how letter like that ought to be written ! ” “ Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage ? ” “ No , it ’ s only the second , really ! But what if it were the fourth , what if it were the fifteenth , that ’ s all nonsense ! And if ever I regretted the death of my father and mother , it is now , and I sometimes think if my parent were living what a protest I would have aimed at them ! I would have done something on purpose ... I would have shown them ! I would have astonished them ! I am really sorry there is no one ! ” “ To surprise ! He-he ! Well , be that a you will , ” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted , “ but tell me this ; do you know the dead man ’ s daughter , the delicate-looking little thing ? It ’ s true what they say about her , isn ’ t it ? ” “ What of it ? I think , that is , it is my own personal conviction that this is the normal condition of woman . Why not ? I mean , _distinguons_ . In our present society it is not altogether normal , because it is compulsory , but in the future society it will be perfectly normal , because it will be voluntary . Even a it is , she wa quite right : she wa suffering and that wa her asset , so to speak , her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of . Of course , in the future society there will be no need of asset , but her part will have another significance , rational and in harmony with her environment . As to Sofya Semyonovna personally , I regard her action a a vigorous protest against the organisation of society , and I respect her deeply for it ; I rejoice indeed when I look at her ! ” “ I wa told that you got her turned out of these lodgings. ” Lebeziatnikov wa enraged . “ That ’ s another slander , ” he yelled . “ It wa not so at all ! That wa all Katerina Ivanovna ’ s invention , for she did not understand ! And I never made love to Sofya Semyonovna ! I wa simply developing her , entirely disinterestedly , trying to rouse her to protest .... All I wanted wa her protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway ! ” “ Have you asked her to join your community ? ” “ You keep on laughing and very inappropriately , allow me to tell you . You don ’ t understand ! There is no such rôle in a community . The community is established that there should be no such rôles . In a community , such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there , what , under present condition , is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community . It all depends on the environment . It ’ s all the environment and man himself is nothing . And I am on good term with Sofya Semyonovna to this day , which is a proof that she never regarded me a having wronged her . I am trying now to attract her to the community , but on quite , quite a different footing . What are you laughing at ? We are trying to establish a community of our own , a special one , on a broader basis . We have gone further in our conviction . We reject more ! And meanwhile I ’ m still developing Sofya Semyonovna . She ha a beautiful , beautiful character ! ” “ And you take advantage of her fine character , eh ? He-he ! ” “ No , no ! Oh , no ! On the contrary. ” “ Oh , on the contrary ! He-he-he ! A queer thing to say ! ” “ Believe me ! Why should I disguise it ? In fact , I feel it strange myself how timid , chaste and modern she is with me ! ” “ And you , of course , are developing her ... he-he ! trying to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense ? ” “ Not at all , not at all ! How coarsely , how stupidly -- excuse me saying so -- you misunderstand the word development ! Good heaven , how ... crude you still are ! We are striving for the freedom of woman and you have only one idea in your head .... Setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty a useless in themselves and indeed prejudice , I fully accept her chastity with me , because that ’ s for her to decide . Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me , I should think myself very lucky , because I like the girl very much ; but a it is , no one ha ever treated her more courteously than I , with more respect for her dignity ... I wait in hope , that ’ s all ! ” “ You had much better make her a present of something . I bet you never thought of that. ” “ You don ’ t understand , a I ’ ve told you already ! Of course , she is in such a position , but it ’ s another question . Quite another question ! You simply despise her . Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt , you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature . You don ’ t know what a character she is ! I am only sorry that of late she ha quite given up reading and borrowing book . I used to lend them to her . I am sorry , too , that with all the energy and resolution in protesting -- which she ha already shown once -- she ha little self-reliance , little , so to say , independence , so a to break free from certain prejudice and certain foolish idea . Yet she thoroughly understands some question , for instance about kissing of hand , that is , that it ’ s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand , because it ’ s a sign of inequality . We had a debate about it and I described it to her . She listened attentively to an account of the workman ’ s association in France , too . Now I am explaining the question of coming into the room in the future society. ” “ And what ’ s that , pray ? ” “ We had a debate lately on the question : Has a member of the community the right to enter another member ’ s room , whether man or woman , at any time ... and we decided that he ha ! ” “ It might be at an inconvenient moment , he-he ! ” Lebeziatnikov wa really angry . “ You are always thinking of something unpleasant , ” he cried with aversion . “ Tfoo ! How vexed I am that when I wa expounding our system , I referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy ! It ’ s always a stumbling-block to people like you , they turn it into ridicule before they understand it . And how proud they are of it , too ! Tfoo ! I ’ ve often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he ha a firm faith in the system . And tell me , please , what do you find so shameful even in cesspool ? I should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like . And it ’ s not a question of self-sacrifice , it ’ s simply work , honourable , useful work which is a good a any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin , because it is more useful. ” “ And more honourable , more honourable , he-he-he ! ” “ What do you mean by ‘ more honourable ’ ? I don ’ t understand such expression to describe human activity . ‘ More honourable , ’ ‘ nobler ’ -- all those are old-fashioned prejudice which I reject . Everything which is _of use_ to mankind is honourable . I only understand one word : _useful_ ! You can snigger a much a you like , but that ’ s so ! ” Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily . He had finished counting the money and wa putting it away . But some of the note he left on the table . The “ cesspool question ” had already been a subject of dispute between them . What wa absurd wa that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry , while it amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his young friend . “ It ’ s your ill-luck yesterday that make you so ill-humoured and annoying , ” blurted out Lebeziatnikov , who in spite of his “ independence ” and his “ protest ” did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier year . “ You ’ d better tell me this , ” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty displeasure , “ can you ... or rather are you really friendly enough with that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute ? I think they ’ ve all come back from the cemetery ... I heard the sound of step ... I want to see her , that young person. ” “ What for ? ” Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise . “ Oh , I want to . I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I wanted to speak to her about ... However , you may be present during the interview . It ’ s better you should be , indeed . For there ’ s no knowing what you might imagine. ” “ I shan ’ t imagine anything . I only asked and , if you ’ ve anything to say to her , nothing is easier than to call her in . I ’ ll go directly and you may be sure I won ’ t be in your way. ” Five minute later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia . She came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness a usual . She wa always shy in such circumstance and wa always afraid of new people , she had been a a child and wa even more so now .... Pyotr Petrovitch met her “ politely and affably , ” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion wa suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ a she . He hastened to “ reassure ” her and made her sit down facing him at the table . Sonia sat down , looked about her -- at Lebeziatnikov , at the note lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eye remained riveted on him . Lebeziatnikov wa moving to the door . Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov . “ Is Raskolnikov in there ? Has he come ? ” he asked him in a whisper . “ Raskolnikov ? Yes . Why ? Yes , he is there . I saw him just come in .... Why ? ” “ Well , I particularly beg you to remain here with u and not to leave me alone with this ... young woman . I only want a few word with her , but God know what they may make of it . I shouldn ’ t like Raskolnikov to repeat anything .... You understand what I mean ? ” “ I understand ! ” Lebeziatnikov saw the point . “ Yes , you are right .... Of course , I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy , but ... still , you are right . Certainly I ’ ll stay . I ’ ll stand here at the window and not be in your way ... I think you are right ... ” Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa , sat down opposite Sonia , looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified , even severe expression , a much a to say , “ don ’ t you make any mistake , madam. ” Sonia wa overwhelmed with embarrassment . “ In the first place , Sofya Semyonovna , will you make my excuse to your respected mamma .... That ’ s right , isn ’ t it ? Katerina Ivanovna stand in the place of a mother to you ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity , though affably . It wa evident that his intention were friendly . “ Quite so , yes ; the place of a mother , ” Sonia answered , timidly and hurriedly . “ Then will you make my apology to her ? Through inevitable circumstance I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma ’ s kind invitation. ” “ Yes ... I ’ ll tell her ... at once. ” And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat . “ Wait , that ’ s not all , ” Pyotr Petrovitch detained her , smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manner , “ and you know me little , my dear Sofya Semyonovna , if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only . I have another object. ” Sonia sat down hurriedly . Her eye rested again for an instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured note that remained on the table , but she quickly looked away and fixed her eye on Pyotr Petrovitch . She felt it horribly indecorous , especially for _her_ , to look at another person ’ s money . She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger . But suddenly she looked away and , not knowing where to turn , ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face . After a pause of still greater dignity he continued . “ I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of word with Katerina Ivanovna , poor woman . That wa sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position -- preternatural , if one may so express it. ” “ Yes ... preternatural ... ” Sonia hurriedly assented . “ Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say , ill. ” “ Yes , simpler and more comprehen ... yes , ill. ” “ Quite so . So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion , I should be glad to be of service to her in any way , foreseeing her unfortunate position . I believe the whole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you ? ” “ Allow me to ask , ” Sonia rose to her foot , “ did you say something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension ? Because she told me you had undertaken to get her one . Was that true ? ” “ Not in the slightest , and indeed it ’ s an absurdity ! I merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance a the widow of an official who had died in the service -- if only she ha patronage ... but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late . In fact , if there could be any hope , it would be very ephemeral , because there would be no claim for assistance in that case , far from it .... And she is dreaming of a pension already , he-he-he ! ... A go-ahead lady ! ” “ Yes , she is . For she is credulous and good-hearted , and she belief everything from the goodness of her heart and ... and ... and she is like that ... yes ... You must excuse her , ” said Sonia , and again she got up to go . “ But you haven ’ t heard what I have to say. ” “ No , I haven ’ t heard , ” muttered Sonia . “ Then sit down. ” She wa terribly confused ; she sat down again a third time . “ Seeing her position with her unfortunate little one , I should be glad , a I have said before , so far a lie in my power , to be of service , that is , so far a is in my power , not more . One might for instance get up a subscription for her , or a lottery , something of the sort , such a is always arranged in such case by friend or even outsider desirous of assisting people . It wa of that I intended to speak to you ; it might be done. ” “ Yes , yes ... God will repay you for it , ” faltered Sonia , gazing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch . “ It might be , but we will talk of it later . We might begin it to-day , we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak . Come to me at seven o ’ clock . Mr. Lebeziatnikov , I hope , will assist u . But there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for which I venture to trouble you , Sofya Semyonovna , to come here . In my opinion money can not be , indeed it ’ s unsafe to put it into Katerina Ivanovna ’ s own hand . The dinner to-day is a proof of that . Though she ha not , so to speak , a crust of bread for to-morrow and ... well , boot or shoe , or anything ; she ha bought to-day Jamaica rum , and even , I believe , Madeira and ... and coffee . I saw it a I passed through . To-morrow it will all fall upon you again , they won ’ t have a crust of bread . It ’ s absurd , really , and so , to my thinking , a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money , but only you , for instance . Am I right ? ” “ I don ’ t know ... this is only to-day , once in her life .... She wa so anxious to do honour , to celebrate the memory .... And she is very sensible ... but just a you think and I shall be very , very ... they will all be ... and God will reward ... and the orphan ... ” Sonia burst into tear . “ Very well , then , keep it in mind ; and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare , from me personally . I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it . Here ... having so to speak anxiety of my own , I can not do more ... ” And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully unfolded . Sonia took it , flushed crimson , jumped up , muttered something and began taking leave . Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door . She got out of the room at last , agitated and distressed , and returned to Katerina Ivanovna , overwhelmed with confusion . All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room , anxious not to interrupt the conversation ; when Sonia had gone he walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand . “ I heard and _saw_ everything , ” he said , laying stress on the last verb . “ That is honourable , I mean to say , it ’ s humane ! You wanted to avoid gratitude , I saw ! And although I can not , I confess , in principle sympathise with private charity , for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it , yet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure -- yes , yes , I like it. ” “ That ’ s all nonsense , ” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch , somewhat disconcerted , looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov . “ No , it ’ s not nonsense ! A man who ha suffered distress and annoyance a you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others , such a man ... even though he is making a social mistake -- is still deserving of respect ! I did not expect it indeed of you , Pyotr Petrovitch , especially a according to your idea ... oh , what a drawback your idea are to you ! How distressed you are for instance by your ill-luck yesterday , ” cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov , who felt a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch . “ And , what do you want with marriage , with _legal_ marriage , my dear , noble Pyotr Petrovitch ? Why do you cling to this _legality_ of marriage ? Well , you may beat me if you like , but I am glad , positively glad it hasn ’ t come off , that you are free , that you are not quite lost for humanity .... you see , I ’ ve spoken my mind ! ” “ Because I don ’ t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another man ’ s child , that ’ s why I want legal marriage , ” Luzhin replied in order to make some answer . He seemed preoccupied by something . “ Children ? You referred to child , ” Lebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call . “ Children are a social question and a question of first importance , I agree ; but the question of child ha another solution . Some refuse to have child altogether , because they suggest the institution of the family . We ’ ll speak of child later , but now a to the question of honour , I confess that ’ s my weak point . That horrid , military , Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future . What doe it mean indeed ? It ’ s nonsense , there will be no deception in a free marriage ! That is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage , so to say , it corrective , a protest . So that indeed it ’ s not humiliating ... and if I ever , to suppose an absurdity , were to be legally married , I should be positively glad of it . I should say to my wife : ‘ My dear , hitherto I have loved you , now I respect you , for you ’ ve shown you can protest ! ’ You laugh ! That ’ s because you are incapable of getting away from prejudice . Confound it all ! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage , but it ’ s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated . When the deception is open , a in a free marriage , then it doe not exist , it ’ s unthinkable . Your wife will only prove how she respect you by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for her new husband . Damn it all ! I sometimes dream if I were to be married , pfoo ! I mean if I were to marry , legally or not , it ’ s just the same , I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself . ‘ My dear , ’ I should say , ‘ I love you , but even more than that I desire you to respect me . See ! ’ Am I not right ? ” Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered a he listened , but without much merriment . He hardly heard it indeed . He wa preoccupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it . Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his hand . Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards . CHAPTER II It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna ’ s disordered brain . Nearly ten of the twenty rouble , given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov ’ s funeral , were wasted upon it . Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased “ suitably , ” that all the lodger , and still more Amalia Ivanovna , might know “ that he wa in no way their inferior , and perhaps very much their superior , ” and that no one had the right “ to turn up his nose at him. ” Perhaps the chief element wa that peculiar “ poor man ’ s pride , ” which compels many poor people to spend their last saving on some traditional social ceremony , simply in order to do “ like other people , ” and not to “ be looked down upon. ” It is very probable , too , that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion , at the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone , to show those “ wretched contemptible lodger ” that she knew “ how to do thing , how to entertain ” and that she had been brought up “ in a genteel , she might almost say aristocratic colonel ’ s family ” and had not been meant for sweeping floor and washing the child ’ s rag at night . Even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysm of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving . And Katerina Ivanovna wa not broken-spirited ; she might have been killed by circumstance , but her spirit could not have been broken , that is , she could not have been intimidated , her will could not be crushed . Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her mind wa unhinged . She could not be said to be insane , but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained . The later stage of consumption are apt , doctor tell u , to affect the intellect . There wa no great variety of wine , nor wa there Madeira ; but wine there wa . There wa vodka , rum and Lisbon wine , all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity . Besides the traditional rice and honey , there were three or four dish , one of which consisted of pancake , all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna ’ s kitchen . Two samovar were boiling , that tea and punch might be offered after dinner . Katerina Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provision , with the help of one of the lodger , an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippevechsel ’ s . He promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna ’ s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before running about a fast a his leg could carry him , and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it . For every trifle he ran to Katerina Ivanovna , even hunting her out at the bazaar , at every instant called her “ _Pani_. ” She wa heartily sick of him before the end , though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this “ serviceable and magnanimous man. ” It wa one of Katerina Ivanovna ’ s characteristic to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colour . Her praise were so exaggerated a sometimes to be embarrassing ; she would invent various circumstance to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality . Then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hour before been literally adoring . She wa naturally of a gay , lively and peace-loving disposition , but from continual failure and misfortune she had come to desire so _keenly_ that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the peace , that the slightest jar , the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy , and she would pas in an instant from the brightest hope and fancy to cursing her fate and raving , and knocking her head against the wall . Amalia Ivanovna , too , suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in Katerina Ivanovna ’ s eye and wa treated by her with extraordinary respect , probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparation . She had undertaken to lay the table , to provide the linen , crockery , etc. , and to cook the dish in her kitchen , and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hand and gone herself to the cemetery . Everything had been well done . Even the table-cloth wa nearly clean ; the crockery , knife , fork and glass were , of course , of all shape and pattern , lent by different lodger , but the table wa properly laid at the time fixed , and Amalia Ivanovna , feeling she had done her work well , had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbon and met the returning party with some pride . This pride , though justifiable , displeased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason : “ a though the table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna ! ” She disliked the cap with new ribbon , too . “ Could she be stuck up , the stupid German , because she wa mistress of the house , and had consented a a favour to help her poor lodger ! As a favour ! Fancy that ! Katerina Ivanovna ’ s father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty person , and then anyone like Amalia Ivanovna , or rather Ludwigovna , would not have been allowed into the kitchen. ” Katerina Ivanovna , however , put off expressing her feeling for the time and contented herself with treating her coldly , though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her proper place , for goodness only knew what she wa fancying herself . Katerina Ivanovna wa irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodger invited had come to the funeral , except the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery , while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up , the wretched creature , many of them not quite sober . The older and more respectable of them all , a if by common consent , stayed away . Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin , for instance , who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodger , did not appear , though Katerina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world , that is Amalia Ivanovna , Polenka , Sonia and the Pole , that he wa the most generous , noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connection , who had been a friend of her first husband ’ s , and a guest in her father ’ s house , and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension . It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna exalted anyone ’ s connection and fortune , it wa without any ulterior motive , quite disinterestedly , for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised . Probably “ taking his cue ” from Luzhin , “ that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either . What did he fancy himself ? He wa only asked out of kindness and because he wa sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and wa a friend of his , so that it would have been awkward not to invite him. ” Among those who failed to appear were “ the genteel lady and her old-maidish daughter , ” who had only been lodger in the house for the last fortnight , but had several time complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna ’ s room , especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk . Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who , quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna , and threatening to turn the whole family out of door , had shouted at her that they “ were not worth the foot ” of the honourable lodger whom they were disturbing . Katerina Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter , “ whose foot she wa not worth , ” and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them , so that they might know that “ she wa more noble in her thought and feeling and did not harbour malice , ” and might see that she wa not accustomed to her way of living . She had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusion to her late father ’ s governorship , and also at the same time to hint that it wa exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her . The fat colonel-major ( he wa really a discharged officer of low rank ) wa also absent , but it appeared that he had been “ not himself ” for the last two day . The party consisted of the Pole , a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat , who had not a word to say for himself , and smelt abominably , a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial age maintained by someone at Amalia Ivanovna ’ s . A retired clerk of the commissariat department came , too ; he wa drunk , had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy -- wa without a waistcoat ! One of the visitor sat straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna . Finally one person having no suit appeared in his dressing-gown , but this wa too much , and the effort of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him . The Pole brought with him , however , two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna ’ s and whom no one had seen here before . All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna intensely . “ For whom had they made all these preparation then ? ” To make room for the visitor the child had not even been laid for at the table ; but the two little one were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box , while Polenka a a big girl had to look after them , feed them , and keep their nose wiped like well-bred child ’ s . Katerina Ivanovna , in fact , could hardly help meeting her guest with increased dignity , and even haughtiness . She stared at some of them with special severity , and loftily invited them to take their seat . Rushing to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent , she began treating her with extreme nonchalance , which the latter promptly observed and resented . Such a beginning wa no good omen for the end . All were seated at last . Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery . Katerina Ivanovna wa greatly delighted to see him , in the first place , because he wa the one “ educated visitor , and , a everyone knew , wa in two year to take a professorship in the university , ” and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral . She positively pounced upon him , and made him sit on her left hand ( Amalia Ivanovna wa on her right ) . In spite of her continual anxiety that the dish should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them , in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few day , she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to Raskolnikov all her suppressed feeling and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner , interspersing her remark with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitor and especially of her landlady . “ It ’ s all that cuckoo ’ s fault ! You know whom I mean ? Her , her ! ” Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady . “ Look at her , she ’ s making round eye , she feel that we are talking about her and can ’ t understand . Pfoo , the owl ! Ha-ha ! ( Cough-cough-cough . ) And what doe she put on that cap for ? ( Cough-cough-cough . ) Have you noticed that she want everyone to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being here ? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people , especially those who knew my late husband , and look at the set of fool she ha brought ! The sweep ! Look at that one with the spotty face . And those wretched Poles , ha-ha-ha ! ( Cough-cough-cough . ) Not one of them ha ever poked his nose in here , I ’ ve never set eye on them . What have they come here for , I ask you ? There they sit in a row . Hey , _pan_ ! ” she cried suddenly to one of them , “ have you tasted the pancake ? Take some more ! Have some beer ! Won ’ t you have some vodka ? Look , he ’ s jumped up and is making his bow , they must be quite starved , poor thing . Never mind , let them eat ! They don ’ t make a noise , anyway , though I ’ m really afraid for our landlady ’ s silver spoon ... Amalia Ivanovna ! ” she addressed her suddenly , almost aloud , “ if your spoon should happen to be stolen , I won ’ t be responsible , I warn you ! Ha-ha-ha ! ” She laughed turning to Raskolnikov , and again nodding towards the landlady , in high glee at her sally . “ She didn ’ t understand , she didn ’ t understand again ! Look how she sits with her mouth open ! An owl , a real owl ! An owl in new ribbon , ha-ha-ha ! ” Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minute . Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief wa stained with blood . She showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence , and a soon a she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheek . “ Do you know , I gave her the most delicate instruction , so to speak , for inviting that lady and her daughter , you understand of whom I am speaking ? It needed the utmost delicacy , the greatest nicety , but she ha managed thing so that that fool , that conceited baggage , that provincial nonentity , simply because she is the widow of a major , and ha come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirt in the government office , because at fifty she paint her face ( everybody know it ) ... a creature like that did not think fit to come , and ha not even answered the invitation , which the most ordinary good manner required ! I can ’ t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch ha not come ? But where ’ s Sonia ? Where ha she gone ? Ah , there she is at last ! what is it , Sonia , where have you been ? It ’ s odd that even at your father ’ s funeral you should be so unpunctual . Rodion Romanovitch , make room for her beside you . That ’ s your place , Sonia ... take what you like . Have some of the cold entrée with jelly , that ’ s the best . They ’ ll bring the pancake directly . Have they given the child some ? Polenka , have you got everything ? ( Cough-cough-cough . ) That ’ s all right . Be a good girl , Lida , and , Kolya , don ’ t fidget with your foot ; sit like a little gentleman . What are you saying , Sonia ? ” Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s apology , trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrase which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch . She added that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that , a soon a he possibly could , he would come immediately to discus _business_ alone with her and to consider what could be done for her , etc. , etc . Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna , would flatter her and gratify her pride . She sat down beside Raskolnikov ; she made him a hurried bow , glancing curiously at him . But for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him . She seemed absent-minded , though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna , trying to please her . Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get mourning ; Sonia wa wearing dark brown , and Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress , a dark striped cotton one . The message from Pyotr Petrovitch wa very successful . Listening to Sonia with dignity , Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how Pyotr Petrovitch wa , then at once whispered almost aloud to Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s position and standing to find himself in such “ extraordinary company , ” in spite of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father . “ That ’ s why I am so grateful to you , Rodion Romanovitch , that you have not disdained my hospitality , even in such surroundings , ” she added almost aloud . “ But I am sure that it wa only your special affection for my poor husband that ha made you keep your promise. ” Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitor , and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man : “ Wouldn ’ t he have some more meat , and had he been given some wine ? ” The old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he wa asked , though his neighbour amused themselves by poking and shaking him . He simply gazed about him with his mouth open , which only increased the general mirth . “ What an imbecile ! Look , look ! Why wa he brought ? But a to Pyotr Petrovitch , I always had confidence in him , ” Katerina Ivanovna continued , “ and , of course , he is not like ... ” with an extremely stern face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter wa quite disconcerted , “ not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken a cook into his kitchen , and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the goodness of his heart. ” “ Yes , he wa fond of drink , he wa fond of it , he did drink ! ” cried the commissariat clerk , gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka . “ My late husband certainly had that weakness , and everyone know it , ” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once , “ but he wa a kind and honourable man , who loved and respected his family . The worst of it wa his good nature made him trust all sort of disreputable people , and he drank with fellow who were not worth the sole of his shoe . Would you believe it , Rodion Romanovitch , they found a gingerbread cock in his pocket ; he wa dead drunk , but he did not forget the child ! ” “ A cock ? Did you say a cock ? ” shouted the commissariat clerk . Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply . She sighed , lost in thought . “ No doubt you think , like everyone , that I wa too severe with him , ” she went on , addressing Raskolnikov . “ But that ’ s not so ! He respected me , he respected me very much ! He wa a kind-hearted man ! And how sorry I wa for him sometimes ! He would sit in a corner and look at me , I used to feel so sorry for him , I used to want to be kind to him and then would think to myself : ‘ Be kind to him and he will drink again , ’ it wa only by severity that you could keep him within bounds. ” “ Yes , he used to get his hair pulled pretty often , ” roared the commissariat clerk again , swallowing another glass of vodka . “ Some fool would be the better for a good drubbing , a well a having their hair pulled . I am not talking of my late husband now ! ” Katerina Ivanovna snapped at him . The flush on her cheek grew more and more marked , her chest heaved . In another minute she would have been ready to make a scene . Many of the visitor were sniggering , evidently delighted . They began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him . They were evidently trying to egg him on . “ Allow me to ask what are you alluding to , ” began the clerk , “ that is to say , whose ... about whom ... did you say just now ... But I don ’ t care ! That ’ s nonsense ! Widow ! I forgive you .... Pass ! ” And he took another drink of vodka . Raskolnikov sat in silence , listening with disgust . He only ate from politeness , just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna wa continually putting on his plate , to avoid hurting her feeling . He watched Sonia intently . But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed ; she , too , foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably , and saw with terror Katerina Ivanovna ’ s growing irritation . She knew that she , Sonia , wa the chief reason for the ‘ genteel ’ lady ’ contemptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna ’ s invitation . She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother wa positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question : “ How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young person_ ? ” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an insult to herself , her child , or her father , Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now , “ till she had shown those draggletails that they were both ... ” To make matter worse someone passed Sonia , from the other end of the table , a plate with two heart pierced with an arrow , cut out of black bread . Katerina Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it wa “ a drunken as ! ” Amalia Ivanovna wa foreseeing something amiss , and at the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna ’ s haughtiness , and to restore the good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began , apropos of nothing , telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “ Karl from the chemist ’ s , ” who wa driving one night in a cab , and that “ the cabman wanted him to kill , and Karl very much begged him not to kill , and wept and clasped hand , and frightened and from fear pierced his heart. ” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled , she observed at once that Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdote in Russian ; the latter wa still more offended , and she retorted that her “ _Vater au Berlin_ wa a very important man , and always went with his hand in pockets. ” Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself . “ Listen to the owl ! ” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once , her good-humour almost restored , “ she meant to say he kept his hand in his pocket , but she said he put his hand in people ’ s pocket . ( Cough-cough . ) And have you noticed , Rodion Romanovitch , that all these Petersburg foreigner , the Germans especially , are all stupider than we ! Can you fancy anyone of u telling how ‘ Karl from the chemist ’ s ’ ‘ pierced his heart from fear ’ and that the idiot , instead of punishing the cabman , ‘ clasped his hand and wept , and much begged. ’ Ah , the fool ! And you know she fancy it ’ s very touching and doe not suspect how stupid she is ! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer , anyway one can see that he ha addled his brain with drink , but you know , these foreigner are always so well behaved and serious .... Look how she sits glaring ! She is angry , ha-ha ! ( Cough-cough-cough . ) ” Regaining her good-humour , Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension , she intended to open a school for the daughter of gentleman in her native town T -- -- . This wa the first time she had spoken to him of the project , and she launched out into the most alluring detail . It suddenly appeared that Katerina Ivanovna had in her hand the very certificate of honour of which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern , when he told him that Katerina Ivanovna , his wife , had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personage on leaving school . This certificate of honour wa obviously intended now to prove Katerina Ivanovna ’ s right to open a boarding-school ; but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “ those two stuck-up draggletails ” if they came to the dinner , and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna wa of the most noble , “ she might even say aristocratic family , a colonel ’ s daughter and wa far superior to certain adventuress who have been so much to the fore of late. ” The certificate of honour immediately passed into the hand of the drunken guest , and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it , for it actually contained the statement _en toutes lettres_ , that her father wa of the rank of a major , and also a companion of an order , so that she really wa almost the daughter of a colonel . Warming up , Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T -- -- , on the gymnasium teacher whom she would engage to give lesson in her boarding-school , one a most respectable old Frenchman , one Mangot , who had taught Katerina Ivanovna herself in old day and wa still living in T -- -- , and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate term . Next she spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T -- -- and help her in all her plan . At this someone at the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw . Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it , she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of Sonia ’ s undoubted ability to assist her , of “ her gentleness , patience , devotion , generosity and good education , ” tapping Sonia on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice . Sonia flushed crimson , and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tear , immediately observing that she wa “ nervous and silly , that she wa too much upset , that it wa time to finish , and a the dinner wa over , it wa time to hand round the tea. ” At that moment , Amalia Ivanovna , deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation , and not being listened to , made one last effort , and with secret misgiving ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation , that “ in the future boarding-school she would have to pay particular attention to _die Wäsche_ , and that there certainly must be a good _dame_ to look after the linen , and secondly that the young lady must not novel at night read. ” Katerina Ivanovna , who certainly wa upset and very tired , a well a heartily sick of the dinner , at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna , saying “ she knew nothing about it and wa talking nonsense , that it wa the business of the laundry maid , and not of the directress of a high-class boarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_ , and a for novel-reading , that wa simply rudeness , and she begged her to be silent. ” Amalia Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “ meant her good , ” and that “ she had meant her very good , ” and that “ it wa long since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings. ” Katerina Ivanovna at once “ set her down , ” saying that it wa a lie to say she wished her good , because only yesterday when her dead husband wa lying on the table , she had worried her about the lodging . To this Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those lady , but “ those lady had not come , because those lady _are_ lady and can not come to a lady who is not a lady. ” Katerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her , that a she wa a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady . Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her “ _Vater au Berlin_ wa a very , very important man , and both hand in pocket went , and always used to say : ‘ Poof ! poof ! ’ ” and she leapt up from the table to represent her father , sticking her hand in her pocket , puffing her cheek , and uttering vague sound resembling “ poof ! poof ! ” amid loud laughter from all the lodger , who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna , hoping for a fight . But this wa too much for Katerina Ivanovna , and she at once declared , so that all could hear , that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a father , but wa simply a drunken Petersburg Finn , and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse . Amalia Ivanovna turned a red a a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a father , “ but she had a _Vater au Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof ! ” Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family wa and that on that very certificate of honour it wa stated in print that her father wa a colonel , while Amalia Ivanovna ’ s father -- if she really had one -- wa probably some Finnish milkman , but that probably she never had a father at all , since it wa still uncertain whether her name wa Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna . At this Amalia Ivanovna , lashed to fury , struck the table with her fist , and shrieked that she wa Amalia Ivanovna , and not Ludwigovna , “ that her _Vater_ wa named Johann and that he wa a burgomeister , and that Katerina Ivanovna ’ s _Vater_ wa quite never a burgomeister. ” Katerina Ivanovna rose from her chair , and with a stern and apparently calm voice ( though she wa pale and her chest wa heaving ) observed that “ if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa , she , Katerina Ivanovna , would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot. ” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room , shouting at the top of her voice , that she wa mistress of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodging that minute ; then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoon from the table . There wa a great outcry and uproar , the child began cry . Sonia ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna , but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted something about “ the yellow ticket , ” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia away , and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat . At that minute the door opened , and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared on the threshold . He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eye . Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him . CHAPTER III “ Pyotr Petrovitch , ” she cried , “ protect me ... you at least ! Make this foolish woman understand that she can ’ t behave like this to a lady in misfortune ... that there is a law for such thing .... I ’ ll go to the governor-general himself .... She shall answer for it .... Remembering my father ’ s hospitality protect these orphans. ” “ Allow me , madam .... Allow me. ” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off . “ Your papa a you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing ” ( someone laughed aloud ) “ and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabble with Amalia Ivanovna .... I have come here to speak of my own affair ... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter , Sofya ... Ivanovna , I think it is ? Allow me to pass. ” Pyotr Petrovitch , edging by her , went to the opposite corner where Sonia wa . Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she wa , a though thunderstruck . She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father ’ s hospitality . Though she had invented it herself , she believed in it firmly by this time . She wa struck too by the businesslike , dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr Petrovitch . All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance . Not only wa this “ serious business man ” strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party , but it wa evident , too , that he had come upon some matter of consequence , that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that therefore something wa going to happen . Raskolnikov , standing beside Sonia , moved aside to let him pas ; Pyotr Petrovitch did not seem to notice him . A minute later Lebeziatnikov , too , appeared in the doorway ; he did not come in , but stood still , listening with marked interest , almost wonder , and seemed for a time perplexed . “ Excuse me for possibly interrupting you , but it ’ s a matter of some importance , ” Pyotr Petrovitch observed , addressing the company generally . “ I am glad indeed to find other person present . Amalia Ivanovna , I humbly beg you a mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna . Sofya Ivanovna , ” he went on , addressing Sonia , who wa very much surprised and already alarmed , “ immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble note wa missing from my table , in the room of my friend Mr. Lebeziatnikov . If in any way whatever you know and will tell u where it is now , I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall end there . In the opposite case I shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measure and then ... you must blame yourself. ” Complete silence reigned in the room . Even the cry child were still . Sonia stood deadly pale , staring at Luzhin and unable to say a word . She seemed not to understand . Some second passed . “ Well , how is it to be then ? ” asked Luzhin , looking intently at her . “ I don ’ t know .... I know nothing about it , ” Sonia articulated faintly at last . “ No , you know nothing ? ” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some second . “ Think a moment , mademoiselle , ” he began severely , but still , a it were , admonishing her . “ Reflect , I am prepared to give you time for consideration . Kindly observe this : if I were not so entirely convinced I should not , you may be sure , with my experience venture to accuse you so directly . Seeing that for such direct accusation before witness , if false or even mistaken , I should myself in a certain sense be made responsible , I am aware of that . This morning I changed for my own purpose several five-per-cent security for the sum of approximately three thousand rouble . The account is noted down in my pocket-book . On my return home I proceeded to count the money -- a Mr. Lebeziatnikov will bear witness -- and after counting two thousand three hundred rouble I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket . About five hundred rouble remained on the table and among them three note of a hundred rouble each . At that moment you entered ( at my invitation ) -- and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed ; so that three time you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off . Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this . You yourself , mademoiselle , probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov , solely in order to discus with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative , Katerina Ivanovna ( whose dinner I wa unable to attend ) , and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a subscription , lottery or the like , for her benefit . You thanked me and even shed tear . I describe all this a it took place , primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail ha escaped my recollection . Then I took a ten-rouble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative . Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this . Then I accompanied you to the door -- you being still in the same state of embarrassment -- after which , being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I talked to him for ten minute -- then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I returned to the table with the money lying on it , intending to count it and to put it aside , a I proposed doing before . To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disappeared . Kindly consider the position . Mr. Lebeziatnikov I can not suspect . I am ashamed to allude to such a supposition . I can not have made a mistake in my reckoning , for the minute before your entrance I had finished my account and found the total correct . You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment , your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hand for some time on the table , and taking into consideration your social position and the habit associated with it , I wa , so to say , with horror and positively against my will , _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion -- a cruel , but justifiable suspicion ! I will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction , I realise that I run a certain risk in making this accusation , but a you see , I could not let it pas . I have taken action and I will tell you why : solely , madam , solely , owing to your black ingratitude ! Why ! I invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative , I present you with my donation of ten rouble and you , on the spot , repay me for all that with such an action . It is too bad ! You need a lesson . Reflect ! Moreover , like a true friend I beg you -- and you could have no better friend at this moment -- think what you are doing , otherwise I shall be immovable ! Well , what do you say ? ” “ I have taken nothing , ” Sonia whispered in terror , “ you gave me ten rouble , here it is , take it. ” Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket , untied a corner of it , took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin . “ And the hundred rouble you do not confess to taking ? ” he insisted reproachfully , not taking the note . Sonia looked about her . All were looking at her with such awful , stern , ironical , hostile eye . She looked at Raskolnikov ... he stood against the wall , with his arm crossed , looking at her with glowing eye . “ Good God ! ” broke from Sonia . “ Amalia Ivanovna , we shall have to send word to the police and therefore I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter , ” Luzhin said softly and even kindly . “ _Gott der Barmherzige_ ! I knew she wa the thief , ” cried Amalia Ivanovna , throwing up her hand . “ You knew it ? ” Luzhin caught her up , “ then I suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so . I beg you , worthy Amalia Ivanovna , to remember your word which have been uttered before witnesses. ” There wa a buzz of loud conversation on all side . All were in movement . “ What ! ” cried Katerina Ivanovna , suddenly realising the position , and she rushed at Luzhin . “ What ! You accuse her of stealing ? Sonia ? Ah , the wretch , the wretch ! ” And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arm round her and held her a in a vise . “ Sonia ! how dared you take ten rouble from him ? Foolish girl ! Give it to me ! Give me the ten rouble at once -- here ! ” And snatching the note from Sonia , Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into Luzhin ’ s face . It hit him in the eye and fell on the ground . Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up . Pyotr Petrovitch lost his temper . “ Hold that mad woman ! ” he shouted . At that moment several other person , besides Lebeziatnikov , appeared in the doorway , among them the two lady . “ What ! Mad ? Am I mad ? Idiot ! ” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna . “ You are an idiot yourself , pettifogging lawyer , base man ! Sonia , Sonia take his money ! Sonia a thief ! Why , she ’ d give away her last penny ! ” and Katerina Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter . “ Did you ever see such an idiot ? ” she turned from side to side . “ And you too ? ” she suddenly saw the landlady , “ and you too , sausage eater , you declare that she is a thief , you trashy Prussian hen ’ s leg in a crinoline ! She hasn ’ t been out of this room : she came straight from you , you wretch , and sat down beside me , everyone saw her . She sat here , by Rodion Romanovitch . Search her ! Since she ’ s not left the room , the money would have to be on her ! Search her , search her ! But if you don ’ t find it , then excuse me , my dear fellow , you ’ ll answer for it ! I ’ ll go to our Sovereign , to our Sovereign , to our gracious Tsar himself , and throw myself at his foot , to-day , this minute ! I am alone in the world ! They would let me in ! Do you think they wouldn ’ t ? You ’ re wrong , I will get in ! I will get in ! You reckoned on her meekness ! You relied upon that ! But I am not so submissive , let me tell you ! You ’ ve gone too far yourself . Search her , search her ! ” And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards Sonia . “ I am ready , I ’ ll be responsible ... but calm yourself , madam , calm yourself . I see that you are not so submissive ! ... Well , well , but a to that ... ” Luzhin muttered , “ that ought to be before the police ... though indeed there are witness enough a it is .... I am ready .... But in any case it ’ s difficult for a man ... on account of her sex .... But with the help of Amalia Ivanovna ... though , of course , it ’ s not the way to do thing .... How is it to be done ? ” “ As you will ! Let anyone who like search her ! ” cried Katerina Ivanovna . “ Sonia , turn out your pocket ! See ! Look , monster , the pocket is empty , here wa her handkerchief ! Here is the other pocket , look ! D ’ you see , d ’ you see ? ” And Katerina Ivanovna turned -- or rather snatched -- both pocket inside out . But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin ’ s foot . Everyone saw it , several cried out . Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down , picked up the paper in two finger , lifted it where all could see it and opened it . It wa a hundred-rouble note folded in eight . Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note showing it to everyone . “ Thief ! Out of my lodging . Police , police ! ” yelled Amalia Ivanovna . “ They must to Siberia be sent ! Away ! ” Exclamations arose on all side . Raskolnikov wa silent , keeping his eye fixed on Sonia , except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin . Sonia stood still , a though unconscious . She wa hardly able to feel surprise . Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheek ; she uttered a cry and hid her face in her hand . “ No , it wasn ’ t I ! I didn ’ t take it ! I know nothing about it , ” she cried with a heartrending wail , and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna , who clasped her tightly in her arm , a though she would shelter her from all the world . “ Sonia ! Sonia ! I don ’ t believe it ! You see , I don ’ t believe it ! ” she cried in the face of the obvious fact , swaying her to and fro in her arm like a baby , kissing her face continually , then snatching at her hand and kissing them , too , “ you took it ! How stupid these people are ! Oh dear ! You are fool , fool , ” she cried , addressing the whole room , “ you don ’ t know , you don ’ t know what a heart she ha , what a girl she is ! She take it , she ? She ’ d sell her last rag , she ’ d go barefoot to help you if you needed it , that ’ s what she is ! She ha the yellow passport because my child were starving , she sold herself for u ! Ah , husband , husband ! Do you see ? Do you see ? What a memorial dinner for you ! Merciful heaven ! Defend her , why are you all standing still ? Rodion Romanovitch , why don ’ t you stand up for her ? Do you believe it , too ? You are not worth her little finger , all of you together ! Good God ! Defend her now , at least ! ” The wail of the poor , consumptive , helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience . The agonised , wasted , consumptive face , the parched blood-stained lip , the hoarse voice , the tear unrestrained a a child ’ s , the trustful , childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her . Pyotr Petrovitch at any rate wa at once moved to _compassion_ . “ Madam , madam , this incident doe not reflect upon you ! ” he cried impressively , “ no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it , especially a you have proved her guilt by turning out her pocket , showing that you had no previous idea of it . I am most ready , most ready to show compassion , if poverty , so to speak , drove Sofya Semyonovna to it , but why did you refuse to confess , mademoiselle ? Were you afraid of the disgrace ? The first step ? You lost your head , perhaps ? One can quite understand it .... But how could you have lowered yourself to such an action ? Gentlemen , ” he addressed the whole company , “ gentleman ! Compassionate and , so to say , commiserating these people , I am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me ! And may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future , ” he said , addressing Sonia , “ and I will carry the matter no further . Enough ! ” Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov . Their eye met , and the fire in Raskolnikov ’ s seemed ready to reduce him to ash . Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing . She wa kissing and hugging Sonia like a madwoman . The child , too , were embracing Sonia on all side , and Polenka -- though she did not fully understand what wa wrong -- wa drowned in tear and shaking with sob , a she hid her pretty little face , swollen with weeping , on Sonia ’ s shoulder . “ How vile ! ” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway . Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly . “ What vileness ! ” Lebeziatnikov repeated , staring him straight in the face . Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start -- all noticed it and recalled it afterwards . Lebeziatnikov strode into the room . “ And you dared to call me a witness ? ” he said , going up to Pyotr Petrovitch . “ What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? ” muttered Luzhin . “ I mean that you ... are a slanderer , that ’ s what my word mean ! ” Lebeziatnikov said hotly , looking sternly at him with his short-sighted eye . He wa extremely angry . Raskolnikov gazed intently at him , a though seizing and weighing each word . Again there wa a silence . Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment . “ If you mean that for me , ... ” he began , stammering . “ But what ’ s the matter with you ? Are you out of your mind ? ” “ I ’ m in my mind , but you are a scoundrel ! Ah , how vile ! I have heard everything . I kept waiting on purpose to understand it , for I must own even now it is not quite logical .... What you have done it all for I can ’ t understand. ” “ Why , what have I done then ? Give over talking in your nonsensical riddle ! Or maybe you are drunk ! ” “ You may be a drunkard , perhaps , vile man , but I am not ! I never touch vodka , for it ’ s against my conviction . Would you believe it , he , he himself , with his own hand gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble note -- I saw it , I wa a witness , I ’ ll take my oath ! He did it , he ! ” repeated Lebeziatnikov , addressing all . “ Are you crazy , milksop ? ” squealed Luzhin . “ She is herself before you -- she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her only ten rouble . How could I have given it to her ? ” “ I saw it , I saw it , ” Lebeziatnikov repeated , “ and though it is against my principle , I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court , for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket . Only like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness ! When you were saying good-bye to her at the door , while you held her hand in one hand , with the other , the left , you slipped the note into her pocket . I saw it , I saw it ! ” Luzhin turned pale . “ What lie ! ” he cried impudently , “ why , how could you , standing by the window , see the note ? You fancied it with your short-sighted eye . You are raving ! ” “ No , I didn ’ t fancy it . And though I wa standing some way off , I saw it all . And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window -- that ’ s true -- I knew for certain that it wa a hundred-rouble note , because , when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten rouble , you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note ( I saw it because I wa standing near then , and an idea struck me at once , so that I did not forget you had it in your hand ) . You folded it and kept it in your hand all the time . I didn ’ t think of it again until , when you were getting up , you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it ! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again , that you meant to do her a kindness without my seeing . You can fancy how I watched you and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket . I saw it , I saw it , I ’ ll take my oath. ” Lebeziatnikov wa almost breathless . Exclamations arose on all hand chiefly expressive of wonder , but some were menacing in tone . They all crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch . Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov . “ I wa mistaken in you ! Protect her ! You are the only one to take her part ! She is an orphan . God ha sent you ! ” Katerina Ivanovna , hardly knowing what she wa doing , sank on her knee before him . “ A pack of nonsense ! ” yelled Luzhin , roused to fury , “ it ’ s all nonsense you ’ ve been talking ! ‘ An idea struck you , you didn ’ t think , you noticed ’ -- what doe it amount to ? So I gave it to her on the sly on purpose ? What for ? With what object ? What have I to do with this ... ? ” “ What for ? That ’ s what I can ’ t understand , but that what I am telling you is the fact , that ’ s certain ! So far from my being mistaken , you infamous criminal man , I remember how , on account of it , a question occurred to me at once , just when I wa thanking you and pressing your hand . What made you put it secretly in her pocket ? Why you did it secretly , I mean ? Could it be simply to conceal it from me , knowing that my conviction are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private benevolence , which effect no radical cure ? Well , I decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me . Perhaps , too , I thought , he want to give her a surprise , when she find a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket . ( For I know , some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable action in that way . ) Then the idea struck me , too , that you wanted to test her , to see whether , when she found it , she would come to thank you . Then , too , that you wanted to avoid thanks and that , a the saying is , your right hand should not know ... something of that sort , in fact . I thought of so many possibility that I put off considering it , but still thought it indelicate to show you that I knew your secret . But another idea struck me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she noticed it , that wa why I decided to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred rouble in her pocket . But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov ’ s to take them the ‘ General Treatise on the Positive Method ’ and especially to recommend Piderit ’ s article ( and also Wagner ’ s ) ; then I come on here and what a state of thing I find ! Now could I , could I , have all these idea and reflection if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her pocket ? ” When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical deduction at the end , he wa quite tired , and the perspiration streamed from his face . He could not , ala , even express himself correctly in Russian , though he knew no other language , so that he wa quite exhausted , almost emaciated after this heroic exploit . But his speech produced a powerful effect . He had spoken with such vehemence , with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him . Pyotr Petrovitch felt that thing were going badly with him . “ What is it to do with me if silly idea did occur to you ? ” he shouted , “ that ’ s no evidence . You may have dreamt it , that ’ s all ! And I tell you , you are lying , sir . You are lying and slandering from some spite against me , simply from pique , because I did not agree with your free-thinking , godless , social proposition ! ” But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch . Murmurs of disapproval were heard on all side . “ Ah , that ’ s your line now , is it ! ” cried Lebeziatnikov , “ that ’ s nonsense ! Call the police and I ’ ll take my oath ! There ’ s only one thing I can ’ t understand : what made him risk such a contemptible action . Oh , pitiful , despicable man ! ” “ I can explain why he risked such an action , and if necessary , I , too , will swear to it , ” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice , and he stepped forward . He appeared to be firm and composed . Everyone felt clearly , from the very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved . “ Now I can explain it all to myself , ” said Raskolnikov , addressing Lebeziatnikov . “ From the very beginning of the business , I suspected that there wa some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it . I began to suspect it from some special circumstance known to me only , which I will explain at once to everyone : they account for everything . Your valuable evidence ha finally made everything clear to me . I beg all , all to listen . This gentleman ( he pointed to Luzhin ) wa recently engaged to be married to a young lady -- my sister , Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov . But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me , the day before yesterday , at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room -- I have two witness to prove it . He is a very spiteful man .... The day before yesterday I did not know that he wa staying here , in your room , and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled -- the day before yesterday -- he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral , a a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov . He at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money , not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna , and referred in a most contemptible way to the ... character of Sofya Semyonovna , that is , hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna . All this you understand wa with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister , by insinuating that I wa squandering on unworthy object the money which they had sent me and which wa all they had . Yesterday evening , before my mother and sister and in his presence , I declared that I had given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had never seen her before , indeed . At the same time I added that he , Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin , with all his virtue , wa not worth Sofya Semyonovna ’ s little finger , though he spoke so ill of her . To his question -- would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister , I answered that I had already done so that day . Irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuation , he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them . A final rupture took place and he wa turned out of the house . All this happened yesterday evening . Now I beg your special attention : consider : if he had now succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna wa a thief , he would have shown to my mother and sister that he wa almost right in his suspicion , that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna , that , in attacking me , he wa protecting and preserving the honour of my sister , his betrothed . In fact he might even , through all this , have been able to estrange me from my family , and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them ; to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally , for he ha ground for supposing that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to me . That wa what he wa working for ! That ’ s how I understand it . That ’ s the whole reason for it and there can be no other ! ” It wa like this , or somewhat like this , that Raskolnikov wound up his speech which wa followed very attentively , though often interrupted by exclamation from his audience . But in spite of interruption he spoke clearly , calmly , exactly , firmly . His decisive voice , his tone of conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone . “ Yes , yes , that ’ s it , ” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully , “ that must be it , for he asked me , a soon a Sofya Semyonovna came into our room , whether you were here , whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna ’ s guest . He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret . It wa essential for him that you should be here ! That ’ s it , that ’ s it ! ” Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak . But he wa very pale . He seemed to be deliberating on some mean of escape . Perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away , but at the moment this wa scarcely possible . It would have implied admitting the truth of the accusation brought against him . Moreover , the company , which had already been excited by drink , wa now too much stirred to allow it . The commissariat clerk , though indeed he had not grasped the whole position , wa shouting louder than anyone and wa making some suggestion very unpleasant to Luzhin . But not all those present were drunk ; lodger came in from all the room . The three Poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him : “ The _pan_ is a _lajdak_ ! ” and muttering threat in Polish . Sonia had been listening with strained attention , though she too seemed unable to grasp it all ; she seemed a though she had just returned to consciousness . She did not take her eye off Raskolnikov , feeling that all her safety lay in him . Katerina Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted . Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone , with her mouth wide open , unable to make out what had happened . She only saw that Pyotr Petrovitch had somehow come to grief . Raskolnikov wa attempting to speak again , but they did not let him . Everyone wa crowding round Luzhin with threat and shout of abuse . But Pyotr Petrovitch wa not intimidated . Seeing that his accusation of Sonia had completely failed , he had recourse to insolence : “ Allow me , gentleman , allow me ! Don ’ t squeeze , let me pas ! ” he said , making his way through the crowd . “ And no threat , if you please ! I assure you it will be useless , you will gain nothing by it . On the contrary , you ’ ll have to answer , gentleman , for violently obstructing the course of justice . The thief ha been more than unmasked , and I shall prosecute . Our judge are not so blind and ... not so drunk , and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidel , agitator , and atheist , who accuse me from motif of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit .... Yes , allow me to pas ! ” “ Don ’ t let me find a trace of you in my room ! Kindly leave at once , and everything is at an end between u ! When I think of the trouble I ’ ve been taking , the way I ’ ve been expounding ... all this fortnight ! ” “ I told you myself to-day that I wa going , when you tried to keep me ; now I will simply add that you are a fool . I advise you to see a doctor for your brain and your short sight . Let me pas , gentleman ! ” He forced his way through . But the commissariat clerk wa unwilling to let him off so easily : he picked up a glass from the table , brandished it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch ; but the glass flew straight at Amalia Ivanovna . She screamed , and the clerk , overbalancing , fell heavily under the table . Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room and half an hour later had left the house . Sonia , timid by nature , had felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than anyone , and that she could be wronged with impunity . Yet till that moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care , gentleness and submissiveness before everyone . Her disappointment wa too great . She could , of course , bear with patience and almost without murmur anything , even this . But for the first minute she felt it too bitter . In spite of her triumph and her justification -- when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly -- the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she wa overcome with hysterical weeping . At last , unable to bear any more , she rushed out of the room and ran home , almost immediately after Luzhin ’ s departure . When amidst loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna , it wa more than the landlady could endure . With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina Ivanovna , considering her to blame for everything . “ Out of my lodging ! At once ! Quick march ! ” And with these word she began snatching up everything she could lay her hand on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna , and throwing it on the floor . Katerina Ivanovna , pale , almost fainting , and gasping for breath , jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at Amalia Ivanovna . But the battle wa too unequal : the landlady waved her away like a feather . “ What ! As though that godless calumny wa not enough -- this vile creature attack me ! What ! On the day of my husband ’ s funeral I am turned out of my lodging ! After eating my bread and salt she turn me into the street , with my orphan ! Where am I to go ? ” wailed the poor woman , sobbing and gasping . “ Good God ! ” she cried with flashing eye , “ is there no justice upon earth ? Whom should you protect if not u orphan ? We shall see ! There is law and justice on earth , there is , I will find it ! Wait a bit , godless creature ! Polenka , stay with the child , I ’ ll come back . Wait for me , if you have to wait in the street . We will see whether there is justice on earth ! ” And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov , Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodger who still filled the room , and , wailing and tearful , she ran into the street -- with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice . Polenka with the two little one in her arm crouched , terrified , on the trunk in the corner of the room , where she waited trembling for her mother to come back . Amalia Ivanovna raged about the room , shrieking , lamenting and throwing everything she came across on the floor . The lodger talked incoherently , some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened , others quarrelled and swore at one another , while others struck up a song .... “ Now it ’ s time for me to go , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Well , Sofya Semyonovna , we shall see what you ’ ll say now ! ” And he set off in the direction of Sonia ’ s lodging . CHAPTER IV Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against Luzhin , although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart . But having gone through so much in the morning , he found a sort of relief in a change of sensation , apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia . He wa agitated too , especially at some moment , by the thought of his approaching interview with Sonia : he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta . He knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and , a it were , brushed away the thought of it . So when he cried a he left Katerina Ivanovna ’ s , “ Well , Sofya Semyonovna , we shall see what you ’ ll say now ! ” he wa still superficially excited , still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over Luzhin . But , strange to say , by the time he reached Sonia ’ s lodging , he felt a sudden impotence and fear . He stood still in hesitation at the door , asking himself the strange question : “ Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta ? ” It wa a strange question because he felt at the very time not only that he could not help telling her , but also that he could not put off the telling . He did not yet know why it must be so , he only _felt_ it , and the agonising sense of his impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him . To cut short his hesitation and suffering , he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the doorway . She wa sitting with her elbow on the table and her face in her hand , but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him a though she were expecting him . “ What would have become of me but for you ? ” she said quickly , meeting him in the middle of the room . Evidently she wa in haste to say this to him . It wa what she had been waiting for . Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had only just risen . She stood facing him , two step away , just a she had done the day before . “ Well , Sonia ? ” he said , and felt that his voice wa trembling , “ it wa all due to ‘ your social position and the habit associated with it. ’ Did you understand that just now ? ” Her face showed her distress . “ Only don ’ t talk to me a you did yesterday , ” she interrupted him . “ Please don ’ t begin it . There is misery enough without that. ” She made haste to smile , afraid that he might not like the reproach . “ I wa silly to come away from there . What is happening there now ? I wanted to go back directly , but I kept thinking that ... you would come. ” He told her that Amalia Ivanovna wa turning them out of their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “ to seek justice. ” “ My God ! ” cried Sonia , “ let ’ s go at once .... ” And she snatched up her cape . “ It ’ s everlastingly the same thing ! ” said Raskolnikov , irritably . “ You ’ ve no thought except for them ! Stay a little with me. ” “ But ... Katerina Ivanovna ? ” “ You won ’ t lose Katerina Ivanovna , you may be sure , she ’ ll come to you herself since she ha run out , ” he added peevishly . “ If she doesn ’ t find you here , you ’ ll be blamed for it .... ” Sonia sat down in painful suspense . Raskolnikov wa silent , gazing at the floor and deliberating . “ This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you , ” he began , not looking at Sonia , “ but if he had wanted to , if it had suited his plan , he would have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me . Ah ? ” “ Yes , ” she assented in a faint voice . “ Yes , ” she repeated , preoccupied and distressed . “ But I might easily not have been there . And it wa quite an accident Lebeziatnikov ’ s turning up. ” Sonia wa silent . “ And if you ’ d gone to prison , what then ? Do you remember what I said yesterday ? ” Again she did not answer . He waited . “ I thought you would cry out again ‘ don ’ t speak of it , leave off. ’ ” Raskolnikov gave a laugh , but rather a forced one . “ What , silence again ? ” he asked a minute later . “ We must talk about something , you know . It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain ‘ problem ’ a Lebeziatnikov would say. ” ( He wa beginning to lose the thread . ) “ No , really , I am serious . Imagine , Sonia , that you had known all Luzhin ’ s intention beforehand . Known , that is , for a fact , that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the child and yourself thrown in -- since you don ’ t count yourself for anything -- Polenka too ... for she ’ ll go the same way . Well , if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he or they should go on living , that is whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked thing , or Katerina Ivanovna should die ? How would you decide which of them wa to die ? I ask you ? ” Sonia looked uneasily at him . There wa something peculiar in this hesitating question , which seemed approaching something in a roundabout way . “ I felt that you were going to ask some question like that , ” she said , looking inquisitively at him . “ I dare say you did . But how is it to be answered ? ” “ Why do you ask about what could not happen ? ” said Sonia reluctantly . “ Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked thing ? You haven ’ t dared to decide even that ! ” “ But I can ’ t know the Divine Providence .... And why do you ask what can ’ t be answered ? What ’ s the use of such foolish question ? How could it happen that it should depend on my decision -- who ha made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live ? ” “ Oh , if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it , there is no doing anything , ” Raskolnikov grumbled morosely . “ You ’ d better say straight out what you want ! ” Sonia cried in distress . “ You are leading up to something again .... Can you have come simply to torture me ? ” She could not control herself and began cry bitterly . He looked at her in gloomy misery . Five minute passed . “ Of course you ’ re right , Sonia , ” he said softly at last . He wa suddenly changed . His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance wa gone . Even his voice wa suddenly weak . “ I told you yesterday that I wa not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I ’ ve said is to ask forgiveness .... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake . I wa asking forgiveness , Sonia .... ” He tried to smile , but there wa something helpless and incomplete in his pale smile . He bowed his head and hid his face in his hand . And suddenly a strange , surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for Sonia passed through his heart . As it were wondering and frightened of this sensation , he raised his head and looked intently at her ; but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eye fixed on him ; there wa love in them ; his hatred vanished like a phantom . It wa not the real feeling ; he had taken the one feeling for the other . It only meant that _that_ minute had come . He hid his face in his hand again and bowed his head . Suddenly he turned pale , got up from his chair , looked at Sonia , and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed . His sensation that moment were terribly like the moment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “ he must not lose another minute. ” “ What ’ s the matter ? ” asked Sonia , dreadfully frightened . He could not utter a word . This wa not at all , not at all the way he had intended to “ tell ” and he did not understand what wa happening to him now . She went up to him , softly , sat down on the bed beside him and waited , not taking her eye off him . Her heart throbbed and sank . It wa unendurable ; he turned his deadly pale face to her . His lip worked , helplessly struggling to utter something . A pang of terror passed through Sonia ’ s heart . “ What ’ s the matter ? ” she repeated , drawing a little away from him . “ Nothing , Sonia , don ’ t be frightened .... It ’ s nonsense . It really is nonsense , if you think of it , ” he muttered , like a man in delirium . “ Why have I come to torture you ? ” he added suddenly , looking at her . “ Why , really ? I keep asking myself that question , Sonia .... ” He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before , but now he spoke helplessly , hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor all over . “ Oh , how you are suffering ! ” she muttered in distress , looking intently at him . “ It ’ s all nonsense .... Listen , Sonia. ” He suddenly smiled , a pale helpless smile for two second . “ You remember what I meant to tell you yesterday ? ” Sonia waited uneasily . “ I said a I went away that perhaps I wa saying good-bye for ever , but that if I came to-day I would tell you who ... who killed Lizaveta. ” She began trembling all over . “ Well , here I ’ ve come to tell you. ” “ Then you really meant it yesterday ? ” she whispered with difficulty . “ How do you know ? ” she asked quickly , a though suddenly regaining her reason . Sonia ’ s face grew paler and paler , and she breathed painfully . “ I know. ” She paused a minute . “ Have they found him ? ” she asked timidly . “ No. ” “ Then how do you know about _it_ ? ” she asked again , hardly audibly and again after a minute ’ s pause . He turned to her and looked very intently at her . “ Guess , ” he said , with the same distorted helpless smile . A shudder passed over her . “ But you ... why do you frighten me like this ? ” she said , smiling like a child . “ I must be a great friend of _his_ ... since I know , ” Raskolnikov went on , still gazing into her face , a though he could not turn his eye away . “ He ... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta ... he ... killed her accidentally .... He meant to kill the old woman when she wa alone and he went there ... and then Lizaveta came in ... he killed her too. ” Another awful moment passed . Both still gazed at one another . “ You can ’ t guess , then ? ” he asked suddenly , feeling a though he were flinging himself down from a steeple . “ N-no ... ” whispered Sonia . “ Take a good look. ” As soon a he had said this again , the same familiar sensation froze his heart . He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of Lizaveta . He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta ’ s face , when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the wall , putting out her hand , with childish terror in her face , looking a little child do when they begin to be frightened of something , looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them , shrinking back and holding out their little hand on the point of cry . Almost the same thing happened now to Sonia . With the same helplessness and the same terror , she looked at him for a while and , suddenly putting out her left hand , pressed her finger faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed , moving further from him and keeping her eye fixed even more immovably on him . Her terror infected him . The same fear showed itself on his face . In the same way he stared at her and almost with the same _childish_ smile . “ Have you guessed ? ” he whispered at last . “ Good God ! ” broke in an awful wail from her bosom . She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillow , but a moment later she got up , moved quickly to him , seized both his hand and , gripping them tight in her thin finger , began looking into his face again with the same intent stare . In this last desperate look she tried to look into him and catch some last hope . But there wa no hope ; there wa no doubt remaining ; it wa all true ! Later on , indeed , when she recalled that moment , she thought it strange and wondered why she had seen at once that there wa no doubt . She could not have said , for instance , that she had foreseen something of the sort -- and yet now , a soon a he told her , she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing . “ Stop , Sonia , enough ! don ’ t torture me , ” he begged her miserably . It wa not at all , not at all like this he had thought of telling her , but this is how it happened . She jumped up , seeming not to know what she wa doing , and , wringing her hand , walked into the middle of the room ; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him , her shoulder almost touching his . All of a sudden she started a though she had been stabbed , uttered a cry and fell on her knee before him , she did not know why . “ What have you done -- what have you done to yourself ? ” she said in despair , and , jumping up , she flung herself on his neck , threw her arm round him , and held him tightly . Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile . “ You are a strange girl , Sonia -- you kiss me and hug me when I tell you about that .... You don ’ t think what you are doing. ” “ There is no one -- no one in the whole world now so unhappy a you ! ” she cried in a frenzy , not hearing what he said , and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping . A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at once . He did not struggle against it . Two tear started into his eye and hung on his eyelash . “ Then you won ’ t leave me , Sonia ? ” he said , looking at her almost with hope . “ No , no , never , nowhere ! ” cried Sonia . “ I will follow you , I will follow you everywhere . Oh , my God ! Oh , how miserable I am ! ... Why , why didn ’ t I know you before ! Why didn ’ t you come before ? Oh , dear ! ” “ Here I have come. ” “ Yes , now ! What ’ s to be done now ? ... Together , together ! ” she repeated a it were unconsciously , and she hugged him again . “ I ’ ll follow you to Siberia ! ” He recoiled at this , and the same hostile , almost haughty smile came to his lip . “ Perhaps I don ’ t want to go to Siberia yet , Sonia , ” he said . Sonia looked at him quickly . Again after her first passionate , agonising sympathy for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her . In his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking . She looked at him bewildered . She knew nothing a yet , why , how , with what object it had been . Now all these question rushed at once into her mind . And again she could not believe it : “ He , he is a murderer ! Could it be true ? ” “ What ’ s the meaning of it ? Where am I ? ” she said in complete bewilderment , a though still unable to recover herself . “ How could you , you , a man like you .... How could you bring yourself to it ? ... What doe it mean ? ” “ Oh , well -- to plunder . Leave off , Sonia , ” he answered wearily , almost with vexation . Sonia stood a though struck dumb , but suddenly she cried : “ You were hungry ! It wa ... to help your mother ? Yes ? ” “ No , Sonia , no , ” he muttered , turning away and hanging his head . “ I wa not so hungry .... I certainly did want to help my mother , but ... that ’ s not the real thing either .... Don ’ t torture me , Sonia. ” Sonia clasped her hand . “ Could it , could it all be true ? Good God , what a truth ! Who could believe it ? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder ! Ah , ” she cried suddenly , “ that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna ... that money .... Can that money ... ” “ No , Sonia , ” he broke in hurriedly , “ that money wa not it . Don ’ t worry yourself ! That money my mother sent me and it came when I wa ill , the day I gave it to you .... Razumihin saw it ... he received it for me .... That money wa mine -- my own. ” Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend . “ And _that_ money .... I don ’ t even know really whether there wa any money , ” he added softly , a though reflecting . “ I took a purse off her neck , made of chamois leather ... a purse stuffed full of something ... but I didn ’ t look in it ; I suppose I hadn ’ t time .... And the thing -- chain and trinket -- I buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the V -- -- Prospect . They are all there now .... ” Sonia strained every nerve to listen . “ Then why ... why , you said you did it to rob , but you took nothing ? ” she asked quickly , catching at a straw . “ I don ’ t know .... I haven ’ t yet decided whether to take that money or not , ” he said , musing again ; and , seeming to wake up with a start , he gave a brief ironical smile . “ Ach , what silly stuff I am talking , eh ? ” The thought flashed through Sonia ’ s mind , wasn ’ t he mad ? But she dismissed it at once . “ No , it wa something else. ” She could make nothing of it , nothing . “ Do you know , Sonia , ” he said suddenly with conviction , “ let me tell you : if I ’ d simply killed because I wa hungry , ” laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her , “ I should be _happy_ now . You must believe that ! What would it matter to you , ” he cried a moment later with a sort of despair , “ what would it matter to you if I were to confess that I did wrong ? What do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me ? Ah , Sonia , wa it for that I ’ ve come to you to-day ? ” Again Sonia tried to say something , but did not speak . “ I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left. ” “ Go where ? ” asked Sonia timidly . “ Not to steal and not to murder , don ’ t be anxious , ” he smiled bitterly . “ We are so different .... And you know , Sonia , it ’ s only now , only this moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday ! Yesterday when I said it I did not know where . I asked you for one thing , I came to you for one thing -- not to leave me . You won ’ t leave me , Sonia ? ” She squeezed his hand . “ And why , why did I tell her ? Why did I let her know ? ” he cried a minute later in despair , looking with infinite anguish at her . “ Here you expect an explanation from me , Sonia ; you are sitting and waiting for it , I see that . But what can I tell you ? You won ’ t understand and will only suffer misery ... on my account ! Well , you are cry and embracing me again . Why do you do it ? Because I couldn ’ t bear my burden and have come to throw it on another : you suffer too , and I shall feel better ! And can you love such a mean wretch ? ” “ But aren ’ t you suffering , too ? ” cried Sonia . Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart , and again for an instant softened it . “ Sonia , I have a bad heart , take note of that . It may explain a great deal . I have come because I am bad . There are men who wouldn ’ t have come . But I am a coward and ... a mean wretch . But ... never mind ! That ’ s not the point . I must speak now , but I don ’ t know how to begin. ” He paused and sank into thought . “ Ach , we are so different , ” he cried again , “ we are not alike . And why , why did I come ? I shall never forgive myself that. ” “ No , no , it wa a good thing you came , ” cried Sonia . “ It ’ s better I should know , far better ! ” He looked at her with anguish . “ What if it were really that ? ” he said , a though reaching a conclusion . “ Yes , that ’ s what it wa ! I wanted to become a Napoleon , that is why I killed her .... Do you understand now ? ” “ N-no , ” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly . “ Only speak , speak , I shall understand , I shall understand _in myself_ ! ” she kept begging him . “ You ’ ll understand ? Very well , we shall see ! ” He paused and wa for some time lost in meditation . “ It wa like this : I asked myself one day this question -- what if Napoleon , for instance , had happened to be in my place , and if he had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his career with , but instead of all those picturesque and monumental thing , there had simply been some ridiculous old hag , a pawnbroker , who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk ( for his career , you understand ) . Well , would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other mean ? Wouldn ’ t he have felt a pang at it being so far from monumental and ... and sinful , too ? Well , I must tell you that I worried myself fearfully over that ‘ question ’ so that I wa awfully ashamed when I guessed at last ( all of a sudden , somehow ) that it would not have given him the least pang , that it would not even have struck him that it wa not monumental ... that he would not have seen that there wa anything in it to pause over , and that , if he had had no other way , he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it ! Well , I too ... left off thinking about it ... murdered her , following his example . And that ’ s exactly how it wa ! Do you think it funny ? Yes , Sonia , the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that ’ s just how it was. ” Sonia did not think it at all funny . “ You had better tell me straight out ... without example , ” she begged , still more timidly and scarcely audibly . He turned to her , looked sadly at her and took her hand . “ You are right again , Sonia . Of course that ’ s all nonsense , it ’ s almost all talk ! You see , you know of course that my mother ha scarcely anything , my sister happened to have a good education and wa condemned to drudge a a governess . All their hope were centered on me . I wa a student , but I couldn ’ t keep myself at the university and wa forced for a time to leave it . Even if I had lingered on like that , in ten or twelve year I might ( with luck ) hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand rouble ” ( he repeated it a though it were a lesson ) “ and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister ... well , my sister might well have fared worse ! And it ’ s a hard thing to pas everything by all one ’ s life , to turn one ’ s back upon everything , to forget one ’ s mother and decorously accept the insult inflicted on one ’ s sister . Why should one ? When one ha buried them to burden oneself with others -- wife and child -- and to leave them again without a farthing ? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman ’ s money and to use it for my first year without worrying my mother , to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it -- and to do this all on a broad , thorough scale , so a to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence .... Well ... that ’ s all .... Well , of course in killing the old woman I did wrong .... Well , that ’ s enough. ” He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head sink . “ Oh , that ’ s not it , that ’ s not it , ” Sonia cried in distress . “ How could one ... no , that ’ s not right , not right. ” “ You see yourself that it ’ s not right . But I ’ ve spoken truly , it ’ s the truth. ” “ As though that could be the truth ! Good God ! ” “ I ’ ve only killed a louse , Sonia , a useless , loathsome , harmful creature. ” “ A human being -- a louse ! ” “ I too know it wasn ’ t a louse , ” he answered , looking strangely at her . “ But I am talking nonsense , Sonia , ” he added . “ I ’ ve been talking nonsense a long time .... That ’ s not it , you are right there . There were quite , quite other cause for it ! I haven ’ t talked to anyone for so long , Sonia .... My head ache dreadfully now. ” His eye shone with feverish brilliance . He wa almost delirious ; an uneasy smile strayed on his lip . His terrible exhaustion could be seen through his excitement . Sonia saw how he wa suffering . She too wa growing dizzy . And he talked so strangely ; it seemed somehow comprehensible , but yet ... “ But how , how ! Good God ! ” And she wrung her hand in despair . “ No , Sonia , that ’ s not it , ” he began again suddenly , raising his head , a though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and a it were roused him -- “ that ’ s not it ! Better ... imagine -- yes , it ’ s certainly better -- imagine that I am vain , envious , malicious , base , vindictive and ... well , perhaps with a tendency to insanity . ( Let ’ s have it all out at once ! They ’ ve talked of madness already , I noticed . ) I told you just now I could not keep myself at the university . But do you know that perhaps I might have done ? My mother would have sent me what I needed for the fee and I could have earned enough for clothes , boot and food , no doubt . Lessons had turned up at half a rouble . Razumihin work ! But I turned sulky and wouldn ’ t . ( Yes , sulkiness , that ’ s the right word for it ! ) I sat in my room like a spider . You ’ ve been in my den , you ’ ve seen it .... And do you know , Sonia , that low ceiling and tiny room cramp the soul and the mind ? Ah , how I hated that garret ! And yet I wouldn ’ t go out of it ! I wouldn ’ t on purpose ! I didn ’ t go out for day together , and I wouldn ’ t work , I wouldn ’ t even eat , I just lay there doing nothing . If Nastasya brought me anything , I ate it , if she didn ’ t , I went all day without ; I wouldn ’ t ask , on purpose , from sulkiness ! At night I had no light , I lay in the dark and I wouldn ’ t earn money for candle . I ought to have studied , but I sold my book ; and the dust lie an inch thick on the notebook on my table . I preferred lying still and thinking . And I kept thinking .... And I had dream all the time , strange dream of all sort , no need to describe ! Only then I began to fancy that ... No , that ’ s not it ! Again I am telling you wrong ! You see I kept asking myself then : why am I so stupid that if others are stupid -- and I know they are -- yet I won ’ t be wiser ? Then I saw , Sonia , that if one wait for everyone to get wiser it will take too long .... Afterwards I understood that that would never come to pas , that men won ’ t change and that nobody can alter it and that it ’ s not worth wasting effort over it . Yes , that ’ s so . That ’ s the law of their nature , Sonia , ... that ’ s so ! ... And I know now , Sonia , that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them . Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their eye . He who despises most thing will be a lawgiver among them and he who dare most of all will be most in the right ! So it ha been till now and so it will always be . A man must be blind not to see it ! ” Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia a he said this , he no longer cared whether she understood or not . The fever had complete hold of him ; he wa in a sort of gloomy ecstasy ( he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone ) . Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code . “ I divined then , Sonia , ” he went on eagerly , “ that power is only vouchsafed to the man who dare to stoop and pick it up . There is only one thing , one thing needful : one ha only to dare ! Then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me , no one ! I saw clear a daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world ha had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil ! I ... I wanted _to have the daring_ ... and I killed her . I only wanted to have the daring , Sonia ! That wa the whole cause of it ! ” “ Oh hush , hush , ” cried Sonia , clasping her hand . “ You turned away from God and God ha smitten you , ha given you over to the devil ! ” “ Then Sonia , when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me , wa it a temptation of the devil , eh ? ” “ Hush , don ’ t laugh , blasphemer ! You don ’ t understand , you don ’ t understand ! Oh God ! He won ’ t understand ! ” “ Hush , Sonia ! I am not laughing . I know myself that it wa the devil leading me . Hush , Sonia , hush ! ” he repeated with gloomy insistence . “ I know it all , I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself , lying there in the dark .... I ’ ve argued it all over with myself , every point of it , and I know it all , all ! And how sick , how sick I wa then of going over it all ! I have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning , Sonia , and leave off thinking . And you don ’ t suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool ? I went into it like a wise man , and that wa just my destruction . And you mustn ’ t suppose that I didn ’ t know , for instance , that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power -- I certainly hadn ’ t the right -- or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn ’ t so for me , though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking question .... If I worried myself all those day , wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not , I felt clearly of course that I wasn ’ t Napoleon . I had to endure all the agony of that battle of idea , Sonia , and I longed to throw it off : I wanted to murder without casuistry , to murder for my own sake , for myself alone ! I didn ’ t want to lie about it even to myself . It wasn ’ t to help my mother I did the murder -- that ’ s nonsense -- I didn ’ t do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind . Nonsense ! I simply did it ; I did the murder for myself , for myself alone , and whether I became a benefactor to others , or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men , I couldn ’ t have cared at that moment .... And it wa not the money I wanted , Sonia , when I did it . It wa not so much the money I wanted , but something else .... I know it all now .... Understand me ! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again . I wanted to find out something else ; it wa something else led me on . I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I wa a louse like everybody else or a man . Whether I can step over barrier or not , whether I dare stoop to pick up or not , whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the _right_ ... ” “ To kill ? Have the right to kill ? ” Sonia clasped her hand . “ Ach , Sonia ! ” he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort , but wa contemptuously silent . “ Don ’ t interrupt me , Sonia . I want to prove one thing only , that the devil led me on then and he ha shown me since that I had not the right to take that path , because I am just such a louse a all the rest . He wa mocking me and here I ’ ve come to you now ! Welcome your guest ! If I were not a louse , should I have come to you ? Listen : when I went then to the old woman ’ s I only went to _try_ .... You may be sure of that ! ” “ And you murdered her ! ” “ But how did I murder her ? Is that how men do murder ? Do men go to commit a murder a I went then ? I will tell you some day how I went ! Did I murder the old woman ? I murdered myself , not her ! I crushed myself once for all , for ever .... But it wa the devil that killed that old woman , not I . Enough , enough , Sonia , enough ! Let me be ! ” he cried in a sudden spasm of agony , “ let me be ! ” He leaned his elbow on his knee and squeezed his head in his hand a in a vise . “ What suffering ! ” A wail of anguish broke from Sonia . “ Well , what am I to do now ? ” he asked , suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair . “ What are you to do ? ” she cried , jumping up , and her eye that had been full of tear suddenly began to shine . “ Stand up ! ” ( She seized him by the shoulder , he got up , looking at her almost bewildered . ) “ Go at once , this very minute , stand at the cross-roads , bow down , first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud , ‘ I am a murderer ! ’ Then God will send you life again . Will you go , will you go ? ” she asked him , trembling all over , snatching his two hand , squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eye full of fire . He wa amazed at her sudden ecstasy . “ You mean Siberia , Sonia ? I must give myself up ? ” he asked gloomily . “ Suffer and expiate your sin by it , that ’ s what you must do. ” “ No ! I am not going to them , Sonia ! ” “ But how will you go on living ? What will you live for ? ” cried Sonia , “ how is it possible now ? Why , how can you talk to your mother ? ( Oh , what will become of them now ? ) But what am I saying ? You have abandoned your mother and your sister already . He ha abandoned them already ! Oh , God ! ” she cried , “ why , he know it all himself . How , how can he live by himself ! What will become of you now ? ” “ Don ’ t be a child , Sonia , ” he said softly . “ What wrong have I done them ? Why should I go to them ? What should I say to them ? That ’ s only a phantom .... They destroy men by million themselves and look on it a a virtue . They are knave and scoundrel , Sonia ! I am not going to them . And what should I say to them -- that I murdered her , but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone ? ” he added with a bitter smile . “ Why , they would laugh at me , and would call me a fool for not getting it . A coward and a fool ! They wouldn ’ t understand and they don ’ t deserve to understand . Why should I go to them ? I won ’ t . Don ’ t be a child , Sonia .... ” “ It will be too much for you to bear , too much ! ” she repeated , holding out her hand in despairing supplication . “ Perhaps I ’ ve been unfair to myself , ” he observed gloomily , pondering , “ perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I ’ ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself . I ’ ll make another fight for it. ” A haughty smile appeared on his lip . “ What a burden to bear ! And your whole life , your whole life ! ” “ I shall get used to it , ” he said grimly and thoughtfully . “ Listen , ” he began a minute later , “ stop cry , it ’ s time to talk of the fact : I ’ ve come to tell you that the police are after me , on my track .... ” “ Ach ! ” Sonia cried in terror . “ Well , why do you cry out ? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are frightened ? But let me tell you : I shall not give myself up . I shall make a struggle for it and they won ’ t do anything to me . They ’ ve no real evidence . Yesterday I wa in great danger and believed I wa lost ; but to-day thing are going better . All the fact they know can be explained two way , that ’ s to say I can turn their accusation to my credit , do you understand ? And I shall , for I ’ ve learnt my lesson . But they will certainly arrest me . If it had not been for something that happened , they would have done so to-day for certain ; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-day .... But that ’ s no matter , Sonia ; they ’ ll let me out again ... for there isn ’ t any real proof against me , and there won ’ t be , I give you my word for it . And they can ’ t convict a man on what they have against me . Enough .... I only tell you that you may know .... I will try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they won ’ t be frightened .... My sister ’ s future is secure , however , now , I believe ... and my mother ’ s must be too .... Well , that ’ s all . Be careful , though . Will you come and see me in prison when I am there ? ” “ Oh , I will , I will. ” They sat side by side , both mournful and dejected , a though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore . He looked at Sonia and felt how great wa her love for him , and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved . Yes , it wa a strange and awful sensation ! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that all his hope rested on her ; he expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering , and now , when all her heart turned towards him , he suddenly felt that he wa immeasurably unhappier than before . “ Sonia , ” he said , “ you ’ d better not come and see me when I am in prison. ” Sonia did not answer , she wa cry . Several minute passed . “ Have you a cross on you ? ” she asked , a though suddenly thinking of it . He did not at first understand the question . “ No , of course not . Here , take this one , of cypress wood . I have another , a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta . I changed with Lizaveta : she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon . I will wear Lizaveta ’ s now and give you this . Take it ... it ’ s mine ! It ’ s mine , you know , ” she begged him . “ We will go to suffer together , and together we will bear our cross ! ” “ Give it me , ” said Raskolnikov . He did not want to hurt her feeling . But immediately he drew back the hand he held out for the cross . “ Not now , Sonia . Better later , ” he added to comfort her . “ Yes , yes , better , ” she repeated with conviction , “ when you go to meet your suffering , then put it on . You will come to me , I ’ ll put it on you , we will pray and go together. ” At that moment someone knocked three time at the door . “ Sofya Semyonovna , may I come in ? ” they heard in a very familiar and polite voice . Sonia rushed to the door in a fright . The flaxen head of Mr. Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door . CHAPTER V Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed . “ I ’ ve come to you , Sofya Semyonovna , ” he began . “ Excuse me ... I thought I should find you , ” he said , addressing Raskolnikov suddenly , “ that is , I didn ’ t mean anything ... of that sort ... But I just thought ... Katerina Ivanovna ha gone out of her mind , ” he blurted out suddenly , turning from Raskolnikov to Sonia . Sonia screamed . “ At least it seems so . But ... we don ’ t know what to do , you see ! She came back -- she seems to have been turned out somewhere , perhaps beaten .... So it seems at least , ... She had run to your father ’ s former chief , she didn ’ t find him at home : he wa dining at some other general ’ s .... Only fancy , she rushed off there , to the other general ’ s , and , imagine , she wa so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her , had him fetched out from dinner , it seems . You can imagine what happened . She wa turned out , of course ; but , according to her own story , she abused him and threw something at him . One may well believe it .... How it is she wasn ’ t taken up , I can ’ t understand ! Now she is telling everyone , including Amalia Ivanovna ; but it ’ s difficult to understand her , she is screaming and flinging herself about .... Oh yes , she shout that since everyone ha abandoned her , she will take the child and go into the street with a barrel-organ , and the child will sing and dance , and she too , and collect money , and will go every day under the general ’ s window ... ‘ to let everyone see well-born child , whose father wa an official , begging in the street. ’ She keep beating the child and they are all cry . She is teaching Lida to sing ‘ My Village , ’ the boy to dance , Polenka the same . She is tearing up all the clothes , and making them little cap like actor ; she mean to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle , instead of music .... She won ’ t listen to anything .... Imagine the state of thing ! It ’ s beyond anything ! ” Lebeziatnikov would have gone on , but Sonia , who had heard him almost breathless , snatched up her cloak and hat , and ran out of the room , putting on her thing a she went . Raskolnikov followed her and Lebeziatnikov came after him . “ She ha certainly gone mad ! ” he said to Raskolnikov , a they went out into the street . “ I didn ’ t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna , so I said ‘ it seemed like it , ’ but there isn ’ t a doubt of it . They say that in consumption the tubercle sometimes occur in the brain ; it ’ s a pity I know nothing of medicine . I did try to persuade her , but she wouldn ’ t listen. ” “ Did you talk to her about the tubercle ? ” “ Not precisely of the tubercle . Besides , she wouldn ’ t have understood ! But what I say is , that if you convince a person logically that he ha nothing to cry about , he ’ ll stop cry . That ’ s clear . Is it your conviction that he won ’ t ? ” “ Life would be too easy if it were so , ” answered Raskolnikov . “ Excuse me , excuse me ; of course it would be rather difficult for Katerina Ivanovna to understand , but do you know that in Paris they have been conducting serious experiment a to the possibility of curing the insane , simply by logical argument ? One professor there , a scientific man of standing , lately dead , believed in the possibility of such treatment . His idea wa that there ’ s nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane , and that insanity is , so to say , a logical mistake , an error of judgment , an incorrect view of thing . He gradually showed the madman his error and , would you believe it , they say he wa successful ? But a he made use of douche too , how far success wa due to that treatment remains uncertain .... So it seems at least. ” Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen . Reaching the house where he lived , he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate . Lebeziatnikov woke up with a start , looked about him and hurried on . Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle of it . Why had he come back here ? He looked at the yellow and tattered paper , at the dust , at his sofa .... From the yard came a loud continuous knocking ; someone seemed to be hammering ... He went to the window , rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention . But the yard wa empty and he could not see who wa hammering . In the house on the left he saw some open window ; on the window-sills were pot of sickly-looking geranium . Linen wa hung out of the window ... He knew it all by heart . He turned away and sat down on the sofa . Never , never had he felt himself so fearfully alone ! Yes , he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia , now that he had made her more miserable . “ Why had he gone to her to beg for her tear ? What need had he to poison her life ? Oh , the meanness of it ! ” “ I will remain alone , ” he said resolutely , “ and she shall not come to the prison ! ” Five minute later he raised his head with a strange smile . That wa a strange thought . “ Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia , ” he thought suddenly . He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thought surging through his mind . All at once the door opened and Dounia came in . At first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway , just a he had done at Sonia ; then she came in and sat down in the same place a yesterday , on the chair facing him . He looked silently and almost vacantly at her . “ Don ’ t be angry , brother ; I ’ ve only come for one minute , ” said Dounia . Her face looked thoughtful but not stern . Her eye were bright and soft . He saw that she too had come to him with love . “ Brother , now I know all , _all_ . Dmitri Prokofitch ha explained and told me everything . They are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion .... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that there is no danger , and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror . I don ’ t think so , and I fully understand how indignant you must be , and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you . That ’ s what I am afraid of . As for your cutting yourself off from u , I don ’ t judge you , I don ’ t venture to judge you , and forgive me for having blamed you for it . I feel that I too , if I had so great a trouble , should keep away from everyone . I shall tell mother nothing _of this_ , but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon . Don ’ t worry about her ; _I_ will set her mind at rest ; but don ’ t you try her too much -- come once at least ; remember that she is your mother . And now I have come simply to say ” ( Dounia began to get up ) “ that if you should need me or should need ... all my life or anything ... call me , and I ’ ll come . Good-bye ! ” She turned abruptly and went towards the door . “ Dounia ! ” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her . “ That Razumihin , Dmitri Prokofitch , is a very good fellow. ” Dounia flushed slightly . “ Well ? ” she asked , waiting a moment . “ He is competent , hardworking , honest and capable of real love .... Good-bye , Dounia. ” Dounia flushed crimson , then suddenly she took alarm . “ But what doe it mean , brother ? Are we really parting for ever that you ... give me such a parting message ? ” “ Never mind .... Good-bye. ” He turned away , and walked to the window . She stood a moment , looked at him uneasily , and went out troubled . No , he wa not cold to her . There wa an instant ( the very last one ) when he had longed to take her in his arm and _say good-bye_ to her , and even _to tell_ her , but he had not dared even to touch her hand . “ Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her , and will feel that I stole her kiss. ” “ And would _she_ stand that test ? ” he went on a few minute later to himself . “ No , she wouldn ’ t ; girl like that can ’ t stand thing ! They never do. ” And he thought of Sonia . There wa a breath of fresh air from the window . The daylight wa fading . He took up his cap and went out . He could not , of course , and would not consider how ill he wa . But all this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him . And if he were not lying in high fever it wa perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his leg and in possession of his faculty . But this artificial excitement could not last long . He wandered aimlessly . The sun wa setting . A special form of misery had begun to oppress him of late . There wa nothing poignant , nothing acute about it ; but there wa a feeling of permanence , of eternity about it ; it brought a foretaste of hopeless year of this cold leaden misery , a foretaste of an eternity “ on a square yard of space. ” Towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily . “ With this idiotic , purely physical weakness , depending on the sunset or something , one can ’ t help doing something stupid ! You ’ ll go to Dounia , a well a to Sonia , ” he muttered bitterly . He heard his name called . He looked round . Lebeziatnikov rushed up to him . “ Only fancy , I ’ ve been to your room looking for you . Only fancy , she ’ s carried out her plan , and taken away the child . Sofya Semyonovna and I have had a job to find them . She is rapping on a frying-pan and making the child dance . The child are cry . They keep stopping at the cross-roads and in front of shop ; there ’ s a crowd of fool running after them . Come along ! ” “ And Sonia ? ” Raskolnikov asked anxiously , hurrying after Lebeziatnikov . “ Simply frantic . That is , it ’ s not Sofya Semyonovna ’ s frantic , but Katerina Ivanovna , though Sofya Semyonova ’ s frantic too . But Katerina Ivanovna is absolutely frantic . I tell you she is quite mad . They ’ ll be taken to the police . You can fancy what an effect that will have .... They are on the canal bank , near the bridge now , not far from Sofya Semyonovna ’ s , quite close. ” On the canal bank near the bridge and not two house away from the one where Sonia lodged , there wa a crowd of people , consisting principally of gutter child . The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from the bridge , and it certainly wa a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd . Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl , wearing a torn straw hat , crushed in a hideous way on one side , wa really frantic . She wa exhausted and breathless . Her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever , and indeed out of door in the sunshine a consumptive always look worse than at home . But her excitement did not flag , and every moment her irritation grew more intense . She rushed at the child , shouted at them , coaxed them , told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing , began explaining to them why it wa necessary , and driven to desperation by their not understanding , beat them .... Then she would make a rush at the crowd ; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look , she immediately appealed to him to see what these child “ from a genteel , one may say aristocratic , house ” had been brought to . If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd , she would rush at once at the scoffer and begin squabbling with them . Some people laughed , others shook their head , but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened child . The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken wa not there , at least Raskolnikov did not see it . But instead of rapping on the pan , Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hand , when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing . She too joined in the singing , but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough , which made her curse in despair and even shed tear . What made her most furious wa the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida . Some effort had been made to dress the child up a street singer are dressed . The boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk . There had been no costume for Lida ; she simply had a red knitted cap , or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov , decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather , which had been Katerina Ivanovna ’ s grandmother ’ s and had been preserved a a family possession . Polenka wa in her everyday dress ; she looked in timid perplexity at her mother , and kept at her side , hiding her tear . She dimly realised her mother ’ s condition , and looked uneasily about her . She wa terribly frightened of the street and the crowd . Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna , weeping and beseeching her to return home , but Katerina Ivanovna wa not to be persuaded . “ Leave off , Sonia , leave off , ” she shouted , speaking fast , panting and coughing . “ You don ’ t know what you ask ; you are like a child ! I ’ ve told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German . Let everyone , let all Petersburg see the child begging in the street , though their father wa an honourable man who served all his life in truth and fidelity , and one may say died in the service. ” ( Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it . ) “ Let that wretch of a general see it ! And you are silly , Sonia : what have we to eat ? Tell me that . We have worried you enough , I won ’ t go on so ! Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , is that you ? ” she cried , seeing Raskolnikov and rushing up to him . “ Explain to this silly girl , please , that nothing better could be done ! Even organ-grinder earn their living , and everyone will see at once that we are different , that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary . And that general will lose his post , you ’ ll see ! We shall perform under his window every day , and if the Tsar drive by , I ’ ll fall on my knee , put the child before me , show them to him , and say ‘ Defend u father. ’ He is the father of the fatherless , he is merciful , he ’ ll protect u , you ’ ll see , and that wretch of a general .... Lida , _tenez vous droite_ ! Kolya , you ’ ll dance again . Why are you whimpering ? Whimpering again ! What are you afraid of , stupid ? Goodness , what am I to do with them , Rodion Romanovitch ? If you only knew how stupid they are ! What ’ s one to do with such child ? ” And she , almost cry herself -- which did not stop her uninterrupted , rapid flow of talk -- pointed to the cry child . Raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home , and even said , hoping to work on her vanity , that it wa unseemly for her to be wandering about the street like an organ-grinder , a she wa intending to become the principal of a boarding-school . “ A boarding-school , ha-ha-ha ! A castle in the air , ” cried Katerina Ivanovna , her laugh ending in a cough . “ No , Rodion Romanovitch , that dream is over ! All have forsaken u ! ... And that general .... You know , Rodion Romanovitch , I threw an inkpot at him -- it happened to be standing in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name . I wrote my name , threw it at him and ran away . Oh , the scoundrel , the scoundrel ! But enough of them , now I ’ ll provide for the child myself , I won ’ t bow down to anybody ! She ha had to bear enough for u ! ” she pointed to Sonia . “ Polenka , how much have you got ? Show me ! What , only two farthing ! Oh , the mean wretch ! They give u nothing , only run after u , putting their tongue out . There , what is that blockhead laughing at ? ” ( She pointed to a man in the crowd . ) “ It ’ s all because Kolya here is so stupid ; I have such a bother with him . What do you want , Polenka ? Tell me in French , _parlez-moi français_ . Why , I ’ ve taught you , you know some phrase . Else how are you to show that you are of good family , well brought-up child , and not at all like other organ-grinder ? We aren ’ t going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street , but to sing a genteel song .... Ah , yes , ... What are we to sing ? You keep putting me out , but we ... you see , we are standing here , Rodion Romanovitch , to find something to sing and get money , something Kolya can dance to .... For , a you can fancy , our performance is all impromptu .... We must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly , and then we shall go to Nevsky , where there are far more people of good society , and we shall be noticed at once . Lida know ‘ My Village ’ only , nothing but ‘ My Village , ’ and everyone sings that . We must sing something far more genteel .... Well , have you thought of anything , Polenka ? If only you ’ d help your mother ! My memory ’ s quite gone , or I should have thought of something . We really can ’ t sing ‘ An Hussar. ’ Ah , let u sing in French , ‘ Cinq sou , ’ I have taught it you , I have taught it you . And a it is in French , people will see at once that you are child of good family , and that will be much more touching .... You might sing ‘ Marlborough s ’ en va-t-en guerre , ’ for that ’ s quite a child ’ s song and is sung a a lullaby in all the aristocratic house . “ _Marlborough s ’ en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_ ... ” she began singing . “ But no , better sing ‘ Cinq sous. ’ Now , Kolya , your hand on your hip , make haste , and you , Lida , keep turning the other way , and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hand ! “ _Cinq sou , cinq sou Pour monter notre menage_. ” ( Cough-cough-cough ! ) “ Set your dress straight , Polenka , it ’ s slipped down on your shoulder , ” she observed , panting from coughing . “ Now it ’ s particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly , that all may see that you are well-born child . I said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer , and made of two width . It wa your fault , Sonia , with your advice to make it shorter , and now you see the child is quite deformed by it .... Why , you ’ re all cry again ! What ’ s the matter , stupid ? Come , Kolya , begin . Make haste , make haste ! Oh , what an unbearable child ! “ Cinq sou , cinq sou . “ A policeman again ! What do you want ? ” A policeman wa indeed forcing his way through the crowd . But at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat -- a solid-looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck ( which delighted Katerina Ivanovna and had it effect on the policeman ) -- approached and without a word handed her a green three-rouble note . His face wore a look of genuine sympathy . Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a polite , even ceremonious , bow . “ I thank you , honoured sir , ” she began loftily . “ The cause that have induced u ( take the money , Polenka : you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress ) . You see , honoured sir , these orphan of good family -- I might even say of aristocratic connection -- and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse ... and stamped at my disturbing him . ‘ Your excellency , ’ I said , ‘ protect the orphan , for you knew my late husband , Semyon Zaharovitch , and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrel slandered his only daughter. ’ ... That policeman again ! Protect me , ” she cried to the official . “ Why is that policeman edging up to me ? We have only just run away from one of them . What do you want , fool ? ” “ It ’ s forbidden in the street . You mustn ’ t make a disturbance. ” “ It ’ s you ’ re making a disturbance . It ’ s just the same a if I were grinding an organ . What business is it of yours ? ” “ You have to get a licence for an organ , and you haven ’ t got one , and in that way you collect a crowd . Where do you lodge ? ” “ What , a license ? ” wailed Katerina Ivanovna . “ I buried my husband to-day . What need of a license ? ” “ Calm yourself , madam , calm yourself , ” began the official . “ Come along ; I will escort you .... This is no place for you in the crowd . You are ill. ” “ Honoured sir , honoured sir , you don ’ t know , ” screamed Katerina Ivanovna . “ We are going to the Nevsky .... Sonia , Sonia ! Where is she ? She is cry too ! What ’ s the matter with you all ? Kolya , Lida , where are you going ? ” she cried suddenly in alarm . “ Oh , silly child ! Kolya , Lida , where are they off to ? ... ” Kolya and Lida , scared out of their wit by the crowd , and their mother ’ s mad prank , suddenly seized each other by the hand , and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere . Weeping and wailing , poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them . She wa a piteous and unseemly spectacle , a she ran , weeping and panting for breath . Sonia and Polenka rushed after them . “ Bring them back , bring them back , Sonia ! Oh stupid , ungrateful child ! ... Polenka ! catch them .... It ’ s for your sake I ... ” She stumbled a she ran and fell down . “ She ’ s cut herself , she ’ s bleeding ! Oh , dear ! ” cried Sonia , bending over her . All ran up and crowded around . Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the first at her side , the official too hastened up , and behind him the policeman who muttered , “ Bother ! ” with a gesture of impatience , feeling that the job wa going to be a troublesome one . “ Pass on ! Pass on ! ” he said to the crowd that pressed forward . “ She ’ s dying , ” someone shouted . “ She ’ s gone out of her mind , ” said another . “ Lord have mercy upon u , ” said a woman , crossing herself . “ Have they caught the little girl and the boy ? They ’ re being brought back , the elder one ’ s got them .... Ah , the naughty imp ! ” When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully , they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone , a Sonia thought , but that the blood that stained the pavement red wa from her chest . “ I ’ ve seen that before , ” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov ; “ that ’ s consumption ; the blood flow and choke the patient . I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago ... nearly a pint of blood , all in a minute .... What ’ s to be done though ? She is dying. ” “ This way , this way , to my room ! ” Sonia implored . “ I live here ! ... See , that house , the second from here .... Come to me , make haste , ” she turned from one to the other . “ Send for the doctor ! Oh , dear ! ” Thanks to the official ’ s effort , this plan wa adopted , the policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna . She wa carried to Sonia ’ s room , almost unconscious , and laid on the bed . The blood wa still flowing , but she seemed to be coming to herself . Raskolnikov , Lebeziatnikov , and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman , who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door . Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida , who were trembling and weeping . Several person came in too from the Kapernaumovs ’ room ; the landlord , a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whisker and hair that stood up like a brush , his wife , a woman with an everlastingly scared expression , and several open-mouthed child with wonder-struck face . Among these , Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance . Raskolnikov looked at him with surprise , not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd . A doctor and priest wore spoken of . The official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it wa too late now for the doctor , but he ordered him to be sent for . Kapernaumov ran himself . Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath . The bleeding ceased for a time . She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eye at Sonia , who stood pale and trembling , wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief . At last she asked to be raised . They sat her up on the bed , supporting her on both side . “ Where are the child ? ” she said in a faint voice . “ You ’ ve brought them , Polenka ? Oh the silly ! Why did you run away .... Och ! ” Once more her parched lip were covered with blood . She moved her eye , looking about her . “ So that ’ s how you live , Sonia ! Never once have I been in your room. ” She looked at her with a face of suffering . “ We have been your ruin , Sonia . Polenka , Lida , Kolya , come here ! Well , here they are , Sonia , take them all ! I hand them over to you , I ’ ve had enough ! The ball is over. ” ( Cough ! ) “ Lay me down , let me die in peace. ” They laid her back on the pillow . “ What , the priest ? I don ’ t want him . You haven ’ t got a rouble to spare . I have no sin . God must forgive me without that . He know how I have suffered .... And if He won ’ t forgive me , I don ’ t care ! ” She sank more and more into uneasy delirium . At time she shuddered , turned her eye from side to side , recognised everyone for a minute , but at once sank into delirium again . Her breathing wa hoarse and difficult , there wa a sort of rattle in her throat . “ I said to him , your excellency , ” she ejaculated , gasping after each word . “ That Amalia Ludwigovna , ah ! Lida , Kolya , hand on your hip , make haste ! _Glissez , glissez ! pa de basque ! _ Tap with your heel , be a graceful child ! “ _Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_ “ What next ? That ’ s the thing to sing . “ _Du hast die schönsten Augen Mädchen , wa willst du mehr ? _ “ What an idea ! _Was willst du mehr ? _ What thing the fool invents ! Ah , yes ! “ In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan . “ Ah , how I loved it ! I loved that song to distraction , Polenka ! Your father , you know , used to sing it when we were engaged .... Oh those day ! Oh that ’ s the thing for u to sing ! How doe it go ? I ’ ve forgotten . Remind me ! How wa it ? ” She wa violently excited and tried to sit up . At last , in a horribly hoarse , broken voice , she began , shrieking and gasping at every word , with a look of growing terror . “ In the heat of midday ! ... in the vale ! ... of Dagestan ! ... With lead in my breast ! ... ” “ Your excellency ! ” she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and a flood of tear , “ protect the orphan ! You have been their father ’ s guest ... one may say aristocratic .... ” She started , regaining consciousness , and gazed at all with a sort of terror , but at once recognised Sonia . “ Sonia , Sonia ! ” she articulated softly and caressingly , a though surprised to find her there . “ Sonia darling , are you here , too ? ” They lifted her up again . “ Enough ! It ’ s over ! Farewell , poor thing ! I am done for ! I am broken ! ” she cried with vindictive despair , and her head fell heavily back on the pillow . She sank into unconsciousness again , but this time it did not last long . Her pale , yellow , wasted face dropped back , her mouth fell open , her leg moved convulsively , she gave a deep , deep sigh and died . Sonia fell upon her , flung her arm about her , and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead woman ’ s wasted bosom . Polenka threw herself at her mother ’ s foot , kissing them and weeping violently . Though Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened , they had a feeling that it wa something terrible ; they put their hand on each other ’ s little shoulder , stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouth and began screaming . They were both still in their fancy dress ; one in a turban , the other in the cap with the ostrich feather . And how did “ the certificate of merit ” come to be on the bed beside Katerina Ivanovna ? It lay there by the pillow ; Raskolnikov saw it . He walked away to the window . Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him . “ She is dead , ” he said . “ Rodion Romanovitch , I must have two word with you , ” said Svidrigaïlov , coming up to them . Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew . Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away . “ I will undertake all the arrangement , the funeral and that . You know it ’ s a question of money and , a I told you , I have plenty to spare . I will put those two little one and Polenka into some good orphan asylum , and I will settle fifteen hundred rouble to be paid to each on coming of age , so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them . And I will pull her out of the mud too , for she is a good girl , isn ’ t she ? So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand. ” “ What is your motive for such benevolence ? ” asked Raskolnikov . “ Ah ! you sceptical person ! ” laughed Svidrigaïlov . “ I told you I had no need of that money . Won ’ t you admit that it ’ s simply done from humanity ? She wasn ’ t ‘ a louse , ’ you know ” ( he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay ) , “ wa she , like some old pawnbroker woman ? Come , you ’ ll agree , is Luzhin to go on living , and doing wicked thing or is she to die ? And if I didn ’ t help them , Polenka would go the same way. ” He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness , keeping his eye fixed on Raskolnikov , who turned white and cold , hearing his own phrase , spoken to Sonia . He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov . “ How do you know ? ” he whispered , hardly able to breathe . “ Why , I lodge here at Madame Resslich ’ s , the other side of the wall . Here is Kapernaumov , and there life Madame Resslich , an old and devoted friend of mine . I am a neighbour. ” “ You ? ” “ Yes , ” continued Svidrigaïlov , shaking with laughter . “ I assure you on my honour , dear Rodion Romanovitch , that you have interested me enormously . I told you we should become friend , I foretold it . Well , here we have . And you will see what an accommodating person I am . You ’ ll see that you can get on with me ! ” PART VI CHAPTER I A strange period began for Raskolnikov : it wa a though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there wa no escape . Recalling that period long after , he believed that his mind had been clouded at time , and that it had continued so , with interval , till the final catastrophe . He wa convinced that he had been mistaken about many thing at that time , for instance a to the date of certain event . Anyway , when he tried later on to piece his recollection together , he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him . He had mixed up incident and had explained event a due to circumstance which existed only in his imagination . At time he wa a prey to agony of morbid uneasiness , amounting sometimes to panic . But he remembered , too , moment , hour , perhaps whole day , of complete apathy , which came upon him a a reaction from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility , sometimes seen in the dying . He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position . Certain essential fact which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him . How glad he would have been to be free from some care , the neglect of which would have threatened him with complete , inevitable ruin . He wa particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov , he might be said to be permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov . From the time of Svidrigaïlov ’ s too menacing and unmistakable word in Sonia ’ s room at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna ’ s death , the normal working of his mind seemed to break down . But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness , Raskolnikov wa in no hurry for an explanation of it . At time , finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town , in some wretched eating-house , sitting alone lost in thought , hardly knowing how he had come there , he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov . He recognised suddenly , clearly , and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what term he could . Walking outside the city gate one day , he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there , that he wa waiting for Svidrigaïlov . Another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bush and could not at first understand how he had come there . But during the two or three day after Katerina Ivanovna ’ s death , he had two or three time met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia ’ s lodging , where he had gone aimlessly for a moment . They exchanged a few word and made no reference to the vital subject , a though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time . Katerina Ivanovna ’ s body wa still lying in the coffin , Svidrigaïlov wa busy making arrangement for the funeral . Sonia too wa very busy . At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement , and a very satisfactory one , for Katerina Ivanovna ’ s child ; that he had , through certain connection , succeeded in getting hold of certain personage by whose help the three orphan could be at once placed in very suitable institution ; that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance , a it is much easier to place orphan with some property than destitute one . He said something too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see Raskolnikov , mentioning that “ he would like to consult with him , that there were thing they must talk over .... ” This conversation took place in the passage on the stair . Svidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly , after a brief pause , dropping his voice , asked : “ But how is it , Rodion Romanovitch ; you don ’ t seem yourself ? You look and you listen , but you don ’ t seem to understand . Cheer up ! We ’ ll talk thing over ; I am only sorry , I ’ ve so much to do of my own business and other people ’ s . Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , ” he added suddenly , “ what all men need is fresh air , fresh air ... more than anything ! ” He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server , who were coming up the stair . They had come for the requiem service . By Svidrigaïlov ’ s order it wa sung twice a day punctually . Svidrigaïlov went his way . Raskolnikov stood still a moment , thought , and followed the priest into Sonia ’ s room . He stood at the door . They began quietly , slowly and mournfully singing the service . From his childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and mysteriously awful ; and it wa long since he had heard the requiem service . And there wa something else here a well , too awful and disturbing . He looked at the child : they were all kneeling by the coffin ; Polenka wa weeping . Behind them Sonia prayed , softly and , a it were , timidly weeping . “ These last two day she hasn ’ t said a word to me , she hasn ’ t glanced at me , ” Raskolnikov thought suddenly . The sunlight wa bright in the room ; the incense rose in cloud ; the priest read , “ Give rest , oh Lord .... ” Raskolnikov stayed all through the service . As he blessed them and took his leave , the priest looked round strangely . After the service , Raskolnikov went up to Sonia . She took both his hand and let her head sink on his shoulder . This slight friendly gesture bewildered Raskolnikov . It seemed strange to him that there wa no trace of repugnance , no trace of disgust , no tremor in her hand . It wa the furthest limit of self-abnegation , at least so he interpreted it . Sonia said nothing . Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out . He felt very miserable . If it had been possible to escape to some solitude , he would have thought himself lucky , even if he had to spend his whole life there . But although he had almost always been by himself of late , he had never been able to feel alone . Sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road , once he had even reached a little wood , but the lonelier the place wa , the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him . It did not frighten him , but greatly annoyed him , so that he made haste to return to the town , to mingle with the crowd , to enter restaurant and tavern , to walk in busy thoroughfare . There he felt easier and even more solitary . One day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to song in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it . But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again , a though his conscience smote him . “ Here I sit listening to singing , is that what I ought to be doing ? ” he thought . Yet he felt at once that that wa not the only cause of his uneasiness ; there wa something requiring immediate decision , but it wa something he could not clearly understand or put into word . It wa a hopeless tangle . “ No , better the struggle again ! Better Porfiry again ... or Svidrigaïlov .... Better some challenge again ... some attack . Yes , yes ! ” he thought . He went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run . The thought of Dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic . That night he woke up before morning among some bush in Krestovsky Island , trembling all over with fever ; he walked home , and it wa early morning when he arrived . After some hour ’ sleep the fever left him , but he woke up late , two o ’ clock in the afternoon . He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna ’ s funeral had been fixed for that day , and wa glad that he wa not present at it . Nastasya brought him some food ; he ate and drank with appetite , almost with greediness . His head wa fresher and he wa calmer than he had been for the last three day . He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attack of panic . The door opened and Razumihin came in . “ Ah , he ’ s eating , then he ’ s not ill , ” said Razumihin . He took a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov . He wa troubled and did not attempt to conceal it . He spoke with evident annoyance , but without hurry or raising his voice . He looked a though he had some special fixed determination . “ Listen , ” he began resolutely . “ As far a I am concerned , you may all go to hell , but from what I see , it ’ s clear to me that I can ’ t make head or tail of it ; please don ’ t think I ’ ve come to ask you question . I don ’ t want to know , hang it ! If you begin telling me your secret , I dare say I shouldn ’ t stay to listen , I should go away cursing . I have only come to find out once for all whether it ’ s a fact that you are mad ? There is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so . I admit I ’ ve been disposed to that opinion myself , judging from your stupid , repulsive and quite inexplicable action , and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister . Only a monster or a madman could treat them a you have ; so you must be mad. ” “ When did you see them last ? ” “ Just now . Haven ’ t you seen them since then ? What have you been doing with yourself ? Tell me , please . I ’ ve been to you three time already . Your mother ha been seriously ill since yesterday . She had made up her mind to come to you ; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her ; she wouldn ’ t hear a word . ‘ If he is ill , if his mind is giving way , who can look after him like his mother ? ’ she said . We all came here together , we couldn ’ t let her come alone all the way . We kept begging her to be calm . We came in , you weren ’ t here ; she sat down , and stayed ten minute , while we stood waiting in silence . She got up and said : ‘ If he ’ s gone out , that is , if he is well , and ha forgotten his mother , it ’ s humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness. ’ She returned home and took to her bed ; now she is in a fever . ‘ I see , ’ she said , ‘ that he ha time for _his girl_. ’ She mean by _your girl_ Sofya Semyonovna , your betrothed or your mistress , I don ’ t know . I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna ’ s , for I wanted to know what wa going on . I looked round , I saw the coffin , the child cry , and Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dress . No sign of you . I apologised , came away , and reported to Avdotya Romanovna . So that ’ s all nonsense and you haven ’ t got a girl ; the most likely thing is that you are mad . But here you sit , guzzling boiled beef a though you ’ d not had a bite for three day . Though a far a that go , madman eat too , but though you have not said a word to me yet ... you are not mad ! That I ’ d swear ! Above all , you are not mad ! So you may go to hell , all of you , for there ’ s some mystery , some secret about it , and I don ’ t intend to worry my brain over your secret . So I ’ ve simply come to swear at you , ” he finished , getting up , “ to relieve my mind . And I know what to do now. ” “ What do you mean to do now ? ” “ What business is it of yours what I mean to do ? ” “ You are going in for a drinking bout. ” “ How ... how did you know ? ” “ Why , it ’ s pretty plain. ” Razumihin paused for a minute . “ You always have been a very rational person and you ’ ve never been mad , never , ” he observed suddenly with warmth . “ You ’ re right : I shall drink . Good-bye ! ” And he moved to go out . “ I wa talking with my sister -- the day before yesterday , I think it wa -- about you , Razumihin. ” “ About me ! But ... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday ? ” Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale . One could see that his heart wa throbbing slowly and violently . “ She came here by herself , sat there and talked to me. ” “ She did ! ” “ Yes. ” “ What did you say to her ... I mean , about me ? ” “ I told her you were a very good , honest , and industrious man . I didn ’ t tell her you love her , because she know that herself. ” “ She know that herself ? ” “ Well , it ’ s pretty plain . Wherever I might go , whatever happened to me , you would remain to look after them . I , so to speak , give them into your keeping , Razumihin . I say this because I know quite well how you love her , and am convinced of the purity of your heart . I know that she too may love you and perhaps doe love you already . Now decide for yourself , a you know best , whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not. ” “ Rodya ! You see ... well .... Ach , damn it ! But where do you mean to go ? Of course , if it ’ s all a secret , never mind .... But I ... I shall find out the secret ... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you ’ ve made it all up . Anyway you are a capital fellow , a capital fellow ! ... ” “ That wa just what I wanted to add , only you interrupted , that that wa a very good decision of yours not to find out these secret . Leave it to time , don ’ t worry about it . You ’ ll know it all in time when it must be . Yesterday a man said to me that what a man need is fresh air , fresh air , fresh air . I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that. ” Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement , making a silent conclusion . “ He ’ s a political conspirator ! He must be . And he ’ s on the eve of some desperate step , that ’ s certain . It can only be that ! And ... and Dounia know , ” he thought suddenly . “ So Avdotya Romanovna come to see you , ” he said , weighing each syllable , “ and you ’ re going to see a man who say we need more air , and so of course that letter ... that too must have something to do with it , ” he concluded to himself . “ What letter ? ” “ She got a letter to-day . It upset her very much -- very much indeed . Too much so . I began speaking of you , she begged me not to . Then ... then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part ... then she began warmly thanking me for something ; then she went to her room and locked herself in. ” “ She got a letter ? ” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully . “ Yes , and you didn ’ t know ? hm ... ” They were both silent . “ Good-bye , Rodion . There wa a time , brother , when I .... Never mind , good-bye . You see , there wa a time .... Well , good-bye ! I must be off too . I am not going to drink . There ’ s no need now .... That ’ s all stuff ! ” He hurried out ; but when he had almost closed the door behind him , he suddenly opened it again , and said , looking away : “ Oh , by the way , do you remember that murder , you know Porfiry ’ s , that old woman ? Do you know the murderer ha been found , he ha confessed and given the proof . It ’ s one of those very workman , the painter , only fancy ! Do you remember I defended them here ? Would you believe it , all that scene of fighting and laughing with his companion on the stair while the porter and the two witness were going up , he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion . The cunning , the presence of mind of the young dog ! One can hardly credit it ; but it ’ s his own explanation , he ha confessed it all . And what a fool I wa about it ! Well , he ’ s simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicion of the lawyer -- so there ’ s nothing much to wonder at , I suppose ! Of course people like that are always possible . And the fact that he couldn ’ t keep up the character , but confessed , make him easier to believe in . But what a fool I wa ! I wa frantic on their side ! ” “ Tell me , please , from whom did you hear that , and why doe it interest you so ? ” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation . “ What next ? You ask me why it interest me ! ... Well , I heard it from Porfiry , among others ... It wa from him I heard almost all about it. ” “ From Porfiry ? ” “ From Porfiry. ” “ What ... what did he say ? ” Raskolnikov asked in dismay . “ He gave me a capital explanation of it . Psychologically , after his fashion. ” “ He explained it ? Explained it himself ? ” “ Yes , yes ; good-bye . I ’ ll tell you all about it another time , but now I ’ m busy . There wa a time when I fancied ... But no matter , another time ! ... What need is there for me to drink now ? You have made me drunk without wine . I am drunk , Rodya ! Good-bye , I ’ m going . I ’ ll come again very soon. ” He went out . “ He ’ s a political conspirator , there ’ s not a doubt about it , ” Razumihin decided , a he slowly descended the stair . “ And he ’ s drawn his sister in ; that ’ s quite , quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna ’ s character . There are interview between them ! ... She hinted at it too ... So many of her word .... and hint ... bear that meaning ! And how else can all this tangle be explained ? Hm ! And I wa almost thinking ... Good heaven , what I thought ! Yes , I took leave of my sens and I wronged him ! It wa his doing , under the lamp in the corridor that day . Pfoo ! What a crude , nasty , vile idea on my part ! Nikolay is a brick , for confessing .... And how clear it all is now ! His illness then , all his strange action ... before this , in the university , how morose he used to be , how gloomy .... But what ’ s the meaning now of that letter ? There ’ s something in that , too , perhaps . Whom wa it from ? I suspect ... ! No , I must find out ! ” He thought of Dounia , realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed , and he suddenly broke into a run . As soon a Razumihin went out , Raskolnikov got up , turned to the window , walked into one corner and then into another , a though forgetting the smallness of his room , and sat down again on the sofa . He felt , so to speak , renewed ; again the struggle , so a mean of escape had come . “ Yes , a mean of escape had come ! It had been too stifling , too cramping , the burden had been too agonising . A lethargy had come upon him at time . From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry ’ s he had been suffocating , penned in without hope of escape . After Nikolay ’ s confession , on that very day had come the scene with Sonia ; his behaviour and his last word had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand ; he had grown feebler , instantly and fundamentally ! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia , he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind ! “ And Svidrigaïlov wa a riddle ... He worried him , that wa true , but somehow not on the same point . He might still have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov . Svidrigaïlov , too , might be a mean of escape ; but Porfiry wa a different matter . “ And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin , had explained it _psychologically_ . He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again ! Porfiry ? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay wa guilty , after what had passed between them before Nikolay ’ s appearance , after that tête-à-tête interview , which could have only _one_ explanation ? ( During those day Raskolnikov had often recalled passage in that scene with Porfiry ; he could not bear to let his mind rest on it . ) Such word , such gesture had passed between them , they had exchanged such glance , thing had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pas , that Nikolay , whom Porfiry had seen through at the first word , at the first gesture , could not have shaken his conviction . “ And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect ! The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced it effect then . He had rushed to Porfiry .... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that ? What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay ? He must have some plan ; there wa some design , but what wa it ? It wa true that a long time had passed since that morning -- too long a time -- and no sight nor sound of Porfiry . Well , that wa a bad sign .... ” Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room , still pondering . It wa the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind , at least . “ I must settle Svidrigaïlov , ” he thought , “ and a soon a possible ; he , too , seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord. ” And at that moment there wa such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two -- Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov . At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later , if not now . “ We shall see , we shall see , ” he repeated to himself . But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry himself in the passage . He wa coming in to see him . Raskolnikov wa dumbfounded for a minute , but only for one minute . Strange to say , he wa not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him . He wa simply startled , but wa quickly , instantly , on his guard . “ Perhaps this will mean the end ? But how could Porfiry have approached so quietly , like a cat , so that he had heard nothing ? Could he have been listening at the door ? ” “ You didn ’ t expect a visitor , Rodion Romanovitch , ” Porfiry explained , laughing . “ I ’ ve been meaning to look in a long time ; I wa passing by and thought why not go in for five minute . Are you going out ? I won ’ t keep you long . Just let me have one cigarette. ” “ Sit down , Porfiry Petrovitch , sit down. ” Raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself , if he could have seen it . The last moment had come , the last drop had to be drained ! So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand , yet when the knife is at his throat at last , he feel no fear . Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry , and looked at him without flinching . Porfiry screwed up his eye and began lighting a cigarette . “ Speak , speak , ” seemed a though it would burst from Raskolnikov ’ s heart . “ Come , why don ’ t you speak ? ” CHAPTER II “ Ah these cigarette ! ” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last , having lighted one . “ They are pernicious , positively pernicious , and yet I can ’ t give them up ! I cough , I begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing . You know I am a coward , I went lately to Dr. B -- -- n ; he always give at least half an hour to each patient . He positively laughed looking at me ; he sounded me : ‘ Tobacco ’ s bad for you , ’ he said , ‘ your lung are affected. ’ But how am I to give it up ? What is there to take it place ? I don ’ t drink , that ’ s the mischief , he-he-he , that I don ’ t . Everything is relative , Rodion Romanovitch , everything is relative ! ” “ Why , he ’ s playing his professional trick again , ” Raskolnikov thought with disgust . All the circumstance of their last interview suddenly came back to him , and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then . “ I came to see you the day before yesterday , in the evening ; you didn ’ t know ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch went on , looking round the room . “ I came into this very room . I wa passing by , just a I did to-day , and I thought I ’ d return your call . I walked in a your door wa wide open , I looked round , waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant . Don ’ t you lock your door ? ” Raskolnikov ’ s face grew more and more gloomy . Porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind . “ I ’ ve come to have it out with you , Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow ! I owe you an explanation and must give it to you , ” he continued with a slight smile , just patting Raskolnikov ’ s knee . But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face ; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it . He had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face . “ A strange scene passed between u last time we met , Rodion Romanovitch . Our first interview , too , wa a strange one ; but then ... and one thing after another ! This is the point : I have perhaps acted unfairly to you ; I feel it . Do you remember how we parted ? Your nerve were unhinged and your knee were shaking and so were mine . And , you know , our behaviour wa unseemly , even ungentlemanly . And yet we are gentleman , above all , in any case , gentleman ; that must be understood . Do you remember what we came to ? ... and it wa quite indecorous. ” “ What is he up to , what doe he take me for ? ” Raskolnikov asked himself in amazement , raising his head and looking with open eye on Porfiry . “ I ’ ve decided openness is better between u , ” Porfiry Petrovitch went on , turning his head away and dropping his eye , a though unwilling to disconcert his former victim and a though disdaining his former wile . “ Yes , such suspicion and such scene can not continue for long . Nikolay put a stop to it , or I don ’ t know what we might not have come to . That damned workman wa sitting at the time in the next room -- can you realise that ? You know that , of course ; and I am aware that he came to you afterwards . But what you supposed then wa not true : I had not sent for anyone , I had made no kind of arrangement . You ask why I hadn ’ t ? What shall I say to you ? it had all come upon me so suddenly . I had scarcely sent for the porter ( you noticed them a you went out , I dare say ) . An idea flashed upon me ; I wa firmly convinced at the time , you see , Rodion Romanovitch . Come , I thought -- even if I let one thing slip for a time , I shall get hold of something else -- I shan ’ t lose what I want , anyway . You are nervously irritable , Rodion Romanovitch , by temperament ; it ’ s out of proportion with other quality of your heart and character , which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined . Of course I did reflect even then that it doe not always happen that a man get up and blurts out his whole story . It doe happen sometimes , if you make a man lose all patience , though even then it ’ s rare . I wa capable of realising that . If I only had a fact , I thought , the least little fact to go upon , something I could lay hold of , something tangible , not merely psychological . For if a man is guilty , you must be able to get something substantial out of him ; one may reckon upon most surprising result indeed . I wa reckoning on your temperament , Rodion Romanovitch , on your temperament above all thing ! I had great hope of you at that time. ” “ But what are you driving at now ? ” Raskolnikov muttered at last , asking the question without thinking . “ What is he talking about ? ” he wondered distractedly , “ doe he really take me to be innocent ? ” “ What am I driving at ? I ’ ve come to explain myself , I consider it my duty , so to speak . I want to make clear to you how the whole business , the whole misunderstanding arose . I ’ ve caused you a great deal of suffering , Rodion Romanovitch . I am not a monster . I understand what it must mean for a man who ha been unfortunate , but who is proud , imperious and above all , impatient , to have to bear such treatment ! I regard you in any case a a man of noble character and not without element of magnanimity , though I don ’ t agree with all your conviction . I wanted to tell you this first , frankly and quite sincerely , for above all I don ’ t want to deceive you . When I made your acquaintance , I felt attracted by you . Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so . You have a right to . I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you ’ ve no reason to like me . You may think what you like , but I desire now to do all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart and conscience . I speak sincerely. ” Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause . Raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm . The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy . “ It ’ s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail , ” Porfiry Petrovitch went on . “ Indeed , I could scarcely attempt it . To begin with there were rumour . Through whom , how , and when those rumour came to me ... and how they affected you , I need not go into . My suspicion were aroused by a complete accident , which might just a easily not have happened . What wa it ? Hm ! I believe there is no need to go into that either . Those rumour and that accident led to one idea in my mind . I admit it openly -- for one may a well make a clean breast of it -- I wa the first to pitch on you . The old woman ’ s note on the pledge and the rest of it -- that all came to nothing . Yours wa one of a hundred . I happened , too , to hear of the scene at the office , from a man who described it capitally , unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness . It wa just one thing after another , Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow ! How could I avoid being brought to certain idea ? From a hundred rabbit you can ’ t make a horse , a hundred suspicion don ’ t make a proof , a the English proverb say , but that ’ s only from the rational point of view -- you can ’ t help being partial , for after all a lawyer is only human . I thought , too , of your article in that journal , do you remember , on your first visit we talked of it ? I jeered at you at the time , but that wa only to lead you on . I repeat , Rodion Romanovitch , you are ill and impatient . That you were bold , headstrong , in earnest and ... had felt a great deal I recognised long before . I , too , have felt the same , so that your article seemed familiar to me . It wa conceived on sleepless night , with a throbbing heart , in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm . And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous ! I jeered at you then , but let me tell you that , a a literary amateur , I am awfully fond of such first essay , full of the heat of youth . There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist . Your article is absurd and fantastic , but there ’ s a transparent sincerity , a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it . It ’ s a gloomy article , but that ’ s what ’ s fine in it . I read your article and put it aside , thinking a I did so ‘ that man won ’ t go the common way. ’ Well , I ask you , after that a a preliminary , how could I help being carried away by what followed ? Oh , dear , I am not saying anything , I am not making any statement now . I simply noted it at the time . What is there in it ? I reflected . There ’ s nothing in it , that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing . And it ’ s not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notion : here I have Nikolay on my hand with actual evidence against him -- you may think what you like of it , but it ’ s evidence . He brings in his psychology , too ; one ha to consider him , too , for it ’ s a matter of life and death . Why am I explaining this to you ? That you may understand , and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion . It wa not malicious , I assure you , he-he ! Do you suppose I didn ’ t come to search your room at the time ? I did , I did , he-he ! I wa here when you were lying ill in bed , not officially , not in my own person , but I wa here . Your room wa searched to the last thread at the first suspicion ; but _umsonst_ ! I thought to myself , now that man will come , will come of himself and quickly , too ; if he ’ s guilty , he ’ s sure to come . Another man wouldn ’ t , but he will . And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the subject with you ? We arranged that to excite you , so we purposely spread rumour , that he might discus the case with you , and Razumihin is not a man to restrain his indignation . Mr. Zametov wa tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring . Think of blurting out in a restaurant ‘ I killed her. ’ It wa too daring , too reckless . I thought so myself , if he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent . That wa what I thought at the time . I wa expecting you . But you simply bowled Zametov over and ... well , you see , it all lie in this -- that this damnable psychology can be taken two way ! Well , I kept expecting you , and so it wa , you came ! My heart wa fairly throbbing . Ach ! “ Now , why need you have come ? Your laughter , too , a you came in , do you remember ? I saw it all plain a daylight , but if I hadn ’ t expected you so specially , I should not have noticed anything in your laughter . You see what influence a mood ha ! Mr. Razumihin then -- ah , that stone , that stone under which the thing were hidden ! I seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden . It wa in a kitchen garden , you told Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office ? And when we began picking your article to piece , how you explained it ! One could take every word of yours in two sens , a though there were another meaning hidden . “ So in this way , Rodion Romanovitch , I reached the furthest limit , and knocking my head against a post , I pulled myself up , asking myself what I wa about . After all , I said , you can take it all in another sense if you like , and it ’ s more natural so , indeed . I couldn ’ t help admitting it wa more natural . I wa bothered ! ‘ No , I ’ d better get hold of some little fact ’ I said . So when I heard of the bell-ringing , I held my breath and wa all in a tremor . ‘ Here is my little fact , ’ thought I , and I didn ’ t think it over , I simply wouldn ’ t . I would have given a thousand rouble at that minute to have seen you with my own eye , when you walked a hundred pace beside that workman , after he had called you murderer to your face , and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way . And then what about your trembling , what about your bell-ringing in your illness , in semi-delirium ? “ And so , Rodion Romanovitch , can you wonder that I played such prank on you ? And what made you come at that very minute ? Someone seemed to have sent you , by Jove ! And if Nikolay had not parted u ... and do you remember Nikolay at the time ? Do you remember him clearly ? It wa a thunderbolt , a regular thunderbolt ! And how I met him ! I didn ’ t believe in the thunderbolt , not for a minute . You could see it for yourself ; and how could I ? Even afterwards , when you had gone and he began making very , very plausible answer on certain point , so that I wa surprised at him myself , even then I didn ’ t believe his story ! You see what it is to be a firm a a rock ! No , thought I , _Morgenfrüh_ . What ha Nikolay got to do with it ! ” “ Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him of it .... ” His voice failed him , and he broke off . He had been listening in indescribable agitation , a this man who had seen through and through him , went back upon himself . He wa afraid of believing it and did not believe it . In those still ambiguous word he kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive . “ Mr . Razumihin ! ” cried Porfiry Petrovitch , seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov , who had till then been silent . “ He-he-he ! But I had to put Mr. Razumihin off ; two is company , three is none . Mr. Razumihin is not the right man , besides he is an outsider . He came running to me with a pale face .... But never mind him , why bring him in ? To return to Nikolay , would you like to know what sort of a type he is , how I understand him , that is ? To begin with , he is still a child and not exactly a coward , but something by way of an artist . Really , don ’ t laugh at my describing him so . He is innocent and responsive to influence . He ha a heart , and is a fantastic fellow . He sings and dance , he tell story , they say , so that people come from other village to hear him . He attends school too , and laugh till he cry if you hold up a finger to him ; he will drink himself senseless -- not a a regular vice , but at time , when people treat him , like a child . And he stole , too , then , without knowing it himself , for ‘ How can it be stealing , if one pick it up ? ’ And do you know he is an Old Believer , or rather a dissenter ? There have been Wanderers [ * ] in his family , and he wa for two year in his village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder . I learnt all this from Nikolay and from his fellow villager . And what ’ s more , he wanted to run into the wilderness ! He wa full of fervour , prayed at night , read the old book , ‘ the true ’ one , and read himself crazy . [ * ] A religious sect. -- TRANSLATOR ’ S NOTE . “ Petersburg had a great effect upon him , especially the woman and the wine . He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that . I learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him , and used to go and see him , and now this business came upon him . “ Well , he wa frightened , he tried to hang himself ! He ran away ! How can one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceeding ? The very word ‘ trial ’ frightens some of them . Whose fault is it ? We shall see what the new jury will do . God grant they do good ! Well , in prison , it seems , he remembered the venerable elder ; the Bible , too , made it appearance again . Do you know , Rodion Romanovitch , the force of the word ‘ suffering ’ among some of these people ! It ’ s not a question of suffering for someone ’ s benefit , but simply , ‘ one must suffer. ’ If they suffer at the hand of the authority , so much the better . In my time there wa a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy , and so crazy , do you know , that one day , apropos of nothing , he seized a brick and flung it at the governor ; though he had done him no harm . And the way he threw it too : aimed it a yard on one side on purpose , for fear of hurting him . Well , we know what happens to a prisoner who assault an officer with a weapon . So ‘ he took his suffering. ’ “ So I suspect now that Nikolay want to take his suffering or something of the sort . I know it for certain from fact , indeed . Only he doesn ’ t know that I know . What , you don ’ t admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasant ? Lots of them . The elder now ha begun influencing him , especially since he tried to hang himself . But he ’ ll come and tell me all himself . You think he ’ ll hold out ? Wait a bit , he ’ ll take his word back . I am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence . I have come to like that Nikolay and am studying him in detail . And what do you think ? He-he ! He answered me very plausibly on some point , he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly . But on other point he is simply at sea , know nothing and doesn ’ t even suspect that he doesn ’ t know ! “ No , Rodion Romanovitch , Nikolay doesn ’ t come in ! This is a fantastic , gloomy business , a modern case , an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled , when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘ renews , ’ when comfort is preached a the aim of life . Here we have bookish dream , a heart unhinged by theory . Here we see resolution in the first stage , but resolution of a special kind : he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his leg shook a he went to the crime . He forgot to shut the door after him , and murdered two people for a theory . He committed the murder and couldn ’ t take the money , and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone . It wasn ’ t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell , no , he had to go to the empty lodging , half delirious , to recall the bell-ringing , he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again .... Well , that we grant , wa through illness , but consider this : he is a murderer , but look upon himself a an honest man , despises others , pose a injured innocence . No , that ’ s not the work of a Nikolay , my dear Rodion Romanovitch ! ” All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these word were too great a shock . Raskolnikov shuddered a though he had been stabbed . “ Then ... who then ... is the murderer ? ” he asked in a breathless voice , unable to restrain himself . Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair , a though he were amazed at the question . “ Who is the murderer ? ” he repeated , a though unable to believe his ear . “ Why , _you_ , Rodion Romanovitch ! You are the murderer , ” he added , almost in a whisper , in a voice of genuine conviction . Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa , stood up for a few second and sat down again without uttering a word . His face twitched convulsively . “ Your lip is twitching just a it did before , ” Porfiry Petrovitch observed almost sympathetically . “ You ’ ve been misunderstanding me , I think , Rodion Romanovitch , ” he added after a brief pause , “ that ’ s why you are so surprised . I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you. ” “ It wa not I murdered her , ” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act . “ No , it wa you , you Rodion Romanovitch , and no one else , ” Porfiry whispered sternly , with conviction . They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long , about ten minute . Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his finger through his hair . Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting . Suddenly Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry . “ You are at your old trick again , Porfiry Petrovitch ! Your old method again . I wonder you don ’ t get sick of it ! ” “ Oh , stop that , what doe that matter now ? It would be a different matter if there were witness present , but we are whispering alone . You see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare . Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now ; for myself , I am convinced without it. ” “ If so , what did you come for ? ” Raskolnikov asked irritably . “ I ask you the same question again : if you consider me guilty , why don ’ t you take me to prison ? ” “ Oh , that ’ s your question ! I will answer you , point for point . In the first place , to arrest you so directly is not to my interest. ” “ How so ? If you are convinced you ought .... ” “ Ach , what if I am convinced ? That ’ s only my dream for the time . Why should I put you in safety ? You know that ’ s it , since you ask me to do it . If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him ‘ were you drunk or not ? Who saw me with you ? I simply took you to be drunk , and you were drunk , too. ’ Well , what could I answer , especially a your story is a more likely one than his ? for there ’ s nothing but psychology to support his evidence -- that ’ s almost unseemly with his ugly mug , while you hit the mark exactly , for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and notoriously so . And I have myself admitted candidly several time already that that psychology can be taken in two way and that the second way is stronger and look far more probable , and that apart from that I have a yet nothing against you . And though I shall put you in prison and indeed have come -- quite contrary to etiquette -- to inform you of it beforehand , yet I tell you frankly , also contrary to etiquette , that it won ’ t be to my advantage . Well , secondly , I ’ ve come to you because ... ” “ Yes , yes , secondly ? ” Raskolnikov wa listening breathless . “ Because , a I told you just now , I consider I owe you an explanation . I don ’ t want you to look upon me a a monster , a I have a genuine liking for you , you may believe me or not . And in the third place I ’ ve come to you with a direct and open proposition -- that you should surrender and confess . It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too , for my task will be done . Well , is this open on my part or not ? ” Raskolnikov thought a minute . “ Listen , Porfiry Petrovitch . You said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on , yet now you ’ ve gone on mathematics . Well , what if you are mistaken yourself , now ? ” “ No , Rodion Romanovitch , I am not mistaken . I have a little fact even then , Providence sent it me. ” “ What little fact ? ” “ I won ’ t tell you what , Rodion Romanovitch . And in any case , I haven ’ t the right to put it off any longer , I must arrest you . So think it over : it make no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake . Believe me , it will be better , Rodion Romanovitch. ” Raskolnikov smiled malignantly . “ That ’ s not simply ridiculous , it ’ s positively shameless . Why , even if I were guilty , which I don ’ t admit , what reason should I have to confess , when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison ? ” “ Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , don ’ t put too much faith in word , perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place . That ’ s only theory and my theory , and what authority am I for you ? Perhaps , too , even now I am hiding something from you ? I can ’ t lay bare everything , he-he ! And how can you ask what advantage ? Don ’ t you know how it would lessen your sentence ? You would be confessing at a moment when another man ha taken the crime on himself and so ha muddled the whole case . Consider that ! I swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall come a a complete surprise . We will make a clean sweep of all these psychological point , of a suspicion against you , so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration , for in truth it wa an aberration . I am an honest man , Rodion Romanovitch , and will keep my word. ” Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly . He pondered a long while and at last smiled again , but his smile wa sad and gentle . “ No ! ” he said , apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearance with Porfiry , “ it ’ s not worth it , I don ’ t care about lessening the sentence ! ” “ That ’ s just what I wa afraid of ! ” Porfiry cried warmly and , a it seemed , involuntarily . “ That ’ s just what I feared , that you wouldn ’ t care about the mitigation of sentence. ” Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him . “ Ah , don ’ t disdain life ! ” Porfiry went on . “ You have a great deal of it still before you . How can you say you don ’ t want a mitigation of sentence ? You are an impatient fellow ! ” “ A great deal of what lie before me ? ” “ Of life . What sort of prophet are you , do you know much about it ? Seek and ye shall find . This may be God ’ s mean for bringing you to Him . And it ’ s not for ever , the bondage .... ” “ The time will be shortened , ” laughed Raskolnikov . “ Why , is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of ? It may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it , because you are young ! But anyway _you_ shouldn ’ t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing. ” “ Ach , hang it ! ” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt , a though he did not want to speak aloud . He got up again a though he meant to go away , but sat down again in evident despair . “ Hang it , if you like ! You ’ ve lost faith and you think that I am grossly flattering you ; but how long ha your life been ? How much do you understand ? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original ! It turned out something base , that ’ s true , but you are not hopelessly base . By no mean so base ! At least you didn ’ t deceive yourself for long , you went straight to the furthest point at one bound . How do I regard you ? I regard you a one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cut their entrails out , if only they have found faith or God . Find it and you will live . You have long needed a change of air . Suffering , too , is a good thing . Suffer ! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer . I know you don ’ t believe in it -- but don ’ t be over-wise ; fling yourself straight into life , without deliberation ; don ’ t be afraid -- the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your foot again . What bank ? How can I tell ? I only believe that you have long life before you . I know that you take all my word now for a set speech prepared beforehand , but maybe you will remember them after . They may be of use some time . That ’ s why I speak . It ’ s a well that you only killed the old woman . If you ’ d invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand time more hideous . You ought to thank God , perhaps . How do you know ? Perhaps God is saving you for something . But keep a good heart and have le fear ! Are you afraid of the great expiation before you ? No , it would be shameful to be afraid of it . Since you have taken such a step , you must harden your heart . There is justice in it . You must fulfil the demand of justice . I know that you don ’ t believe it , but indeed , life will bring you through . You will live it down in time . What you need now is fresh air , fresh air , fresh air ! ” Raskolnikov positively started . “ But who are you ? what prophet are you ? From the height of what majestic calm do you proclaim these word of wisdom ? ” “ Who am I ? I am a man with nothing to hope for , that ’ s all . A man perhaps of feeling and sympathy , maybe of some knowledge too , but my day is over . But you are a different matter , there is life waiting for you . Though , who know ? maybe your life , too , will pas off in smoke and come to nothing . Come , what doe it matter , that you will pas into another class of men ? It ’ s not comfort you regret , with your heart ! What of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long ? It ’ s not time , but yourself that will decide that . Be the sun and all will see you . The sun ha before all to be the sun . Why are you smiling again ? At my being such a Schiller ? I bet you ’ re imagining that I am trying to get round you by flattery . Well , perhaps I am , he-he-he ! Perhaps you ’ d better not believe my word , perhaps you ’ d better never believe it altogether -- I ’ m made that way , I confess it . But let me add , you can judge for yourself , I think , how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest. ” “ When do you mean to arrest me ? ” “ Well , I can let you walk about another day or two . Think it over , my dear fellow , and pray to God . It ’ s more in your interest , believe me. ” “ And what if I run away ? ” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile . “ No , you won ’ t run away . A peasant would run away , a fashionable dissenter would run away , the flunkey of another man ’ s thought , for you ’ ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he ’ ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life . But you ’ ve ceased to believe in your theory already , what will you run away with ? And what would you do in hiding ? It would be hateful and difficult for you , and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position , an atmosphere to suit you . And what sort of atmosphere would you have ? If you ran away , you ’ d come back to yourself . _You can ’ t get on without us._ And if I put you in prison -- say you ’ ve been there a month , or two , or three -- remember my word , you ’ ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise . You won ’ t know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession . I am convinced that you will decide , ‘ to take your suffering. ’ You don ’ t believe my word now , but you ’ ll come to it of yourself . For suffering , Rodion Romanovitch , is a great thing . Never mind my having grown fat , I know all the same . Don ’ t laugh at it , there ’ s an idea in suffering , Nikolay is right . No , you won ’ t run away , Rodion Romanovitch. ” Raskolnikov got up and took his cap . Porfiry Petrovitch also rose . “ Are you going for a walk ? The evening will be fine , if only we don ’ t have a storm . Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air. ” He , too , took his cap . “ Porfiry Petrovitch , please don ’ t take up the notion that I have confessed to you to-day , ” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence . “ You ’ re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity . But I have admitted nothing , remember that ! ” “ Oh , I know that , I ’ ll remember . Look at him , he ’ s trembling ! Don ’ t be uneasy , my dear fellow , have it your own way . Walk about a bit , you won ’ t be able to walk too far . If anything happens , I have one request to make of you , ” he added , dropping his voice . “ It ’ s an awkward one , but important . If anything were to happen ( though indeed I don ’ t believe in it and think you quite incapable of it ) , yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hour with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way , in some fantastic fashion -- laying hand on yourself -- ( it ’ s an absurd proposition , but you must forgive me for it ) do leave a brief but precise note , only two line , and mention the stone . It will be more generous . Come , till we meet ! Good thought and sound decision to you ! ” Porfiry went out , stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov . The latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away . Then he too went hurriedly out of the room . CHAPTER III He hurried to Svidrigaïlov ’ s . What he had to hope from that man he did not know . But that man had some hidden power over him . Having once recognised this , he could not rest , and now the time had come . On the way , one question particularly worried him : had Svidrigaïlov been to Porfiry ’ s ? As far a he could judge , he would swear to it , that he had not . He pondered again and again , went over Porfiry ’ s visit ; no , he hadn ’ t been , of course he hadn ’ t . But if he had not been yet , would he go ? Meanwhile , for the present he fancied he couldn ’ t . Why ? He could not have explained , but if he could , he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment . It all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it . Strange to say , none would have believed it perhaps , but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future . Another , much more important anxiety tormented him -- it concerned himself , but in a different , more vital way . Moreover , he wa conscious of immense moral fatigue , though his mind wa working better that morning than it had done of late . And wa it worth while , after all that had happened , to contend with these new trivial difficulty ? Was it worth while , for instance , to manoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry ’ s ? Was it worth while to investigate , to ascertain the fact , to waste time over anyone like Svidrigaïlov ? Oh , how sick he wa of it all ! And yet he wa hastening to Svidrigaïlov ; could he be expecting something _new_ from him , information , or mean of escape ? Men will catch at straw ! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together ? Perhaps it wa only fatigue , despair ; perhaps it wa not Svidrigaïlov but some other whom he needed , and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented himself by chance . Sonia ? But what should he go to Sonia for now ? To beg her tear again ? He wa afraid of Sonia , too . Sonia stood before him a an irrevocable sentence . He must go his own way or hers . At that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her . No , would it not be better to try Svidrigaïlov ? And he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason . But what could they have in common ? Their very evil-doing could not be of the same kind . The man , moreover , wa very unpleasant , evidently depraved , undoubtedly cunning and deceitful , possibly malignant . Such story were told about him . It is true he wa befriending Katerina Ivanovna ’ s child , but who could tell with what motive and what it meant ? The man always had some design , some project . There wa another thought which had been continually hovering of late about Raskolnikov ’ s mind , and causing him great uneasiness . It wa so painful that he made distinct effort to get rid of it . He sometimes thought that Svidrigaïlov wa dogging his footstep . Svidrigaïlov had found out his secret and had had design on Dounia . What if he had them still ? Wasn ’ t it practically certain that he had ? And what if , having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him , he were to use it a a weapon against Dounia ? This idea sometimes even tormented his dream , but it had never presented itself so vividly to him a on his way to Svidrigaïlov . The very thought moved him to gloomy rage . To begin with , this would transform everything , even his own position ; he would have at once to confess his secret to Dounia . Would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step ? The letter ? This morning Dounia had received a letter . From whom could she get letter in Petersburg ? Luzhin , perhaps ? It ’ s true Razumihin wa there to protect her , but Razumihin knew nothing of the position . Perhaps it wa his duty to tell Razumihin ? He thought of it with repugnance . In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov a soon a possible , he decided finally . Thank God , the detail of the interview were of little consequence , if only he could get at the root of the matter ; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable ... if he were intriguing against Dounia -- then ... Raskolnikov wa so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such question in one way ; “ then I shall kill him , ” he thought in cold despair . A sudden anguish oppressed his heart , he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he wa and which way he wa going . He found himself in X . Prospect , thirty or forty pace from the Hay Market , through which he had come . The whole second storey of the house on the left wa used a a tavern . All the window were wide open ; judging from the figure moving at the window , the room were full to overflowing . There were sound of singing , of clarionet and violin , and the boom of a Turkish drum . He could hear woman shrieking . He wa about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X . Prospect , when suddenly at one of the end window he saw Svidrigaïlov , sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth . Raskolnikov wa dreadfully taken aback , almost terrified . Svidrigaïlov wa silently watching and scrutinising him and , what struck Raskolnikov at once , seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved . Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him , but to be looking absent-mindedly away , while he watched him out of the corner of his eye . His heart wa beating violently . Yet , it wa evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen . He took the pipe out of his mouth and wa on the point of concealing himself , but a he got up and moved back his chair , he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen him , and wa watching him . What had passed between them wa much the same a what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov ’ s room . A sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov ’ s face and grew broader and broader . Each knew that he wa seen and watched by the other . At last Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh . “ Well , well , come in if you want me ; I am here ! ” he shouted from the window . Raskolnikov went up into the tavern . He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny back room , adjoining the saloon in which merchant , clerk and number of people of all sort were drinking tea at twenty little table to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singer . The click of billiard ball could be heard in the distance . On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne . In the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ , a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl of eighteen , wearing a tucked-up striped skirt , and a Tyrolese hat with ribbon . In spite of the chorus in the other room , she wa singing some servant ’ hall song in a rather husky contralto , to the accompaniment of the organ . “ Come , that ’ s enough , ” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov ’ s entrance . The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully . She had sung her guttural rhyme , too , with a serious and respectful expression in her face . “ Hey , Philip , a glass ! ” shouted Svidrigaïlov . “ I won ’ t drink anything , ” said Raskolnikov . “ As you like , I didn ’ t mean it for you . Drink , Katia ! I don ’ t want anything more to-day , you can go. ” He poured her out a full glass , and laid down a yellow note . Katia drank off her glass of wine , a woman do , without putting it down , in twenty gulp , took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov ’ s hand , which he allowed quite seriously . She went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ . Both had been brought in from the street . Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg , but everything about him wa already , so to speak , on a patriarchal footing ; the waiter , Philip , wa by now an old friend and very obsequious . The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it . Svidrigaïlov wa at home in this room and perhaps spent whole day in it . The tavern wa dirty and wretched , not even second-rate . “ I wa going to see you and looking for you , ” Raskolnikov began , “ but I don ’ t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X . Prospect just now . I never take this turning . I turn to the right from the Hay Market . And this isn ’ t the way to you . I simply turned and here you are . It is strange ! ” “ Why don ’ t you say at once ‘ it ’ s a miracle ’ ? ” “ Because it may be only chance. ” “ Oh , that ’ s the way with all you folk , ” laughed Svidrigaïlov . “ You won ’ t admit it , even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle ! Here you say that it may be only chance . And what coward they all are here , about having an opinion of their own , you can ’ t fancy , Rodion Romanovitch . I don ’ t mean you , you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it . That ’ s how it wa you attracted my curiosity. ” “ Nothing else ? ” “ Well , that ’ s enough , you know , ” Svidrigaïlov wa obviously exhilarated , but only slightly so , he had not had more than half a glass of wine . “ I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I wa capable of having what you call an opinion of my own , ” observed Raskolnikov . “ Oh , well , it wa a different matter . Everyone ha his own plan . And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep for the last two or three day . I told you of this tavern myself , there is no miracle in your coming straight here . I explained the way myself , told you where it wa , and the hour you could find me here . Do you remember ? ” “ I don ’ t remember , ” answered Raskolnikov with surprise . “ I believe you . I told you twice . The address ha been stamped mechanically on your memory . You turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction , though you are not aware of it . When I told you then , I hardly hoped you understood me . You give yourself away too much , Rodion Romanovitch . And another thing , I ’ m convinced there are lot of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves a they walk . This is a town of crazy people . If only we had scientific men , doctor , lawyer and philosopher might make most valuable investigation in Petersburg each in his own line . There are few place where there are so many gloomy , strong and queer influence on the soul of man a in Petersburg . The mere influence of climate mean so much . And it ’ s the administrative centre of all Russia and it character must be reflected on the whole country . But that is neither here nor there now . The point is that I have several time watched you . You walk out of your house -- holding your head high -- twenty pace from home you let it sink , and fold your hand behind your back . You look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you . At last you begin moving your lip and talking to yourself , and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim , and at last stand still in the middle of the road . That ’ s not at all the thing . Someone may be watching you besides me , and it won ’ t do you any good . It ’ s nothing really to do with me and I can ’ t cure you , but , of course , you understand me. ” “ Do you know that I am being followed ? ” asked Raskolnikov , looking inquisitively at him . “ No , I know nothing about it , ” said Svidrigaïlov , seeming surprised . “ Well , then , let u leave me alone , ” Raskolnikov muttered , frowning . “ Very good , let u leave you alone. ” “ You had better tell me , if you come here to drink , and directed me twice to come here to you , why did you hide , and try to get away just now when I looked at the window from the street ? I saw it. ” “ He-he ! And why wa it you lay on your sofa with closed eye and pretended to be asleep , though you were wide awake while I stood in your doorway ? I saw it. ” “ I may have had ... reason . You know that yourself. ” “ And I may have had my reason , though you don ’ t know them. ” Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table , leaned his chin in the finger of his right hand , and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov . For a full minute he scrutinised his face , which had impressed him before . It wa a strange face , like a mask ; white and red , with bright red lip , with a flaxen beard , and still thick flaxen hair . His eye were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed . There wa something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face , which looked so wonderfully young for his age . Svidrigaïlov wa smartly dressed in light summer clothes and wa particularly dainty in his linen . He wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it . “ Have I got to bother myself about you , too , now ? ” said Raskolnikov suddenly , coming with nervous impatience straight to the point . “ Even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me , I don ’ t want to put myself out any more . I will show you at once that I don ’ t prize myself a you probably think I do . I ’ ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intention with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what ha been discovered of late , I will kill you before you get me locked up . You can reckon on my word . You know that I can keep it . And in the second place if you want to tell me anything -- for I keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me -- make haste and tell it , for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late. ” “ Why in such haste ? ” asked Svidrigaïlov , looking at him curiously . “ Everyone ha his plan , ” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently . “ You urged me yourself to frankness just now , and at the first question you refuse to answer , ” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile . “ You keep fancying that I have aim of my own and so you look at me with suspicion . Of course it ’ s perfectly natural in your position . But though I should like to be friend with you , I shan ’ t trouble myself to convince you of the contrary . The game isn ’ t worth the candle and I wasn ’ t intending to talk to you about anything special. ” “ What did you want me , for , then ? It wa you who came hanging about me. ” “ Why , simply a an interesting subject for observation . I liked the fantastic nature of your position -- that ’ s what it wa ! Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me , and from that person I had in the past heard a very great deal about you , from which I gathered that you had a great influence over her ; isn ’ t that enough ? Ha-ha-ha ! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex , and is difficult for me to answer . Here , you , for instance , have come to me not only for a definite object , but for the sake of hearing something new . Isn ’ t that so ? Isn ’ t that so ? ” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile . “ Well , can ’ t you fancy then that I , too , on my way here in the train wa reckoning on you , on your telling me something new , and on my making some profit out of you ! You see what rich men we are ! ” “ What profit could you make ? ” “ How can I tell you ? How do I know ? You see in what a tavern I spend all my time and it ’ s my enjoyment , that ’ s to say it ’ s no great enjoyment , but one must sit somewhere ; that poor Katia now -- you saw her ? ... If only I had been a glutton now , a club gourmand , but you see I can eat this. ” He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnant of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potato lay on a tin dish . “ Have you dined , by the way ? I ’ ve had something and want nothing more . I don ’ t drink , for instance , at all . Except for champagne I never touch anything , and not more than a glass of that all the evening , and even that is enough to make my head ache . I ordered it just now to wind myself up , for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind . That wa why I hid myself just now like a schoolboy , for I wa afraid you would hinder me . But I believe , ” he pulled out his watch , “ I can spend an hour with you . It ’ s half-past four now . If only I ’ d been something , a landowner , a father , a cavalry officer , a photographer , a journalist ... I am nothing , no specialty , and sometimes I am positively bored . I really thought you would tell me something new. ” “ But what are you , and why have you come here ? ” “ What am I ? You know , a gentleman , I served for two year in the cavalry , then I knocked about here in Petersburg , then I married Marfa Petrovna and lived in the country . There you have my biography ! ” “ You are a gambler , I believe ? ” “ No , a poor sort of gambler . A card-sharper -- not a gambler. ” “ You have been a card-sharper then ? ” “ Yes , I ’ ve been a card-sharper too. ” “ Didn ’ t you get thrashed sometimes ? ” “ It did happen . Why ? ” “ Why , you might have challenged them ... altogether it must have been lively. ” “ I won ’ t contradict you , and besides I am no hand at philosophy . I confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women. ” “ As soon a you buried Marfa Petrovna ? ” “ Quite so , ” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour . “ What of it ? You seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about woman ? ” “ You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice ? ” “ Vice ! Oh , that ’ s what you are after ! But I ’ ll answer you in order , first about woman in general ; you know I am fond of talking . Tell me , what should I restrain myself for ? Why should I give up woman , since I have a passion for them ? It ’ s an occupation , anyway. ” “ So you hope for nothing here but vice ? ” “ Oh , very well , for vice then . You insist on it being vice . But anyway I like a direct question . In this vice at least there is something permanent , founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy , something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember , for ever setting one on fire and , maybe , not to be quickly extinguished , even with year . You ’ ll agree it ’ s an occupation of a sort. ” “ That ’ s nothing to rejoice at , it ’ s a disease and a dangerous one. ” “ Oh , that ’ s what you think , is it ! I agree , that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation . And , of course , in this one must exceed moderation . But in the first place , everybody doe so in one way or another , and in the second place , of course , one ought to be moderate and prudent , however mean it may be , but what am I to do ? If I hadn ’ t this , I might have to shoot myself . I am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored , but yet ... ” “ And could you shoot yourself ? ” “ Oh , come ! ” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust . “ Please don ’ t speak of it , ” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation . His face quite changed . “ I admit it ’ s an unpardonable weakness , but I can ’ t help it . I am afraid of death and I dislike it being talked of . Do you know that I am to a certain extent a mystic ? ” “ Ah , the apparition of Marfa Petrovna ! Do they still go on visiting you ? ” “ Oh , don ’ t talk of them ; there have been no more in Petersburg , confound them ! ” he cried with an air of irritation . “ Let ’ s rather talk of that ... though ... H ’ m ! I have not much time , and can ’ t stay long with you , it ’ s a pity ! I should have found plenty to tell you. ” “ What ’ s your engagement , a woman ? ” “ Yes , a woman , a casual incident .... No , that ’ s not what I want to talk of. ” “ And the hideousness , the filthiness of all your surroundings , doesn ’ t that affect you ? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself ? ” “ And do you pretend to strength , too ? He-he-he ! You surprised me just now , Rodion Romanovitch , though I knew beforehand it would be so . You preach to me about vice and æsthetics ! You -- a Schiller , you -- an idealist ! Of course that ’ s all a it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so , yet it is strange in reality .... Ah , what a pity I have no time , for you ’ re a most interesting type ! And , by-the-way , are you fond of Schiller ? I am awfully fond of him. ” “ But what a braggart you are , ” Raskolnikov said with some disgust . “ Upon my word , I am not , ” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing . “ However , I won ’ t dispute it , let me be a braggart , why not brag , if it hurt no one ? I spent seven year in the country with Marfa Petrovna , so now when I come across an intelligent person like you -- intelligent and highly interesting -- I am simply glad to talk and , besides , I ’ ve drunk that half-glass of champagne and it ’ s gone to my head a little . And besides , there ’ s a certain fact that ha wound me up tremendously , but about that I ... will keep quiet . Where are you off to ? ” he asked in alarm . Raskolnikov had begun getting up . He felt oppressed and stifled and , a it were , ill at ease at having come here . He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov wa the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth . “ A-ach ! Sit down , stay a little ! ” Svidrigaïlov begged . “ Let them bring you some tea , anyway . Stay a little , I won ’ t talk nonsense , about myself , I mean . I ’ ll tell you something . If you like I ’ ll tell you how a woman tried ‘ to save ’ me , a you would call it ? It will be an answer to your first question indeed , for the woman wa your sister . May I tell you ? It will help to spend the time. ” “ Tell me , but I trust that you ... ” “ Oh , don ’ t be uneasy . Besides , even in a worthless low fellow like me , Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect. ” CHAPTER IV “ You know perhaps -- yes , I told you myself , ” began Svidrigaïlov , “ that I wa in the debtor ’ prison here , for an immense sum , and had not any expectation of being able to pay it . There ’ s no need to go into particular how Marfa Petrovna bought me out ; do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love ? She wa an honest woman , and very sensible , although completely uneducated . Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman , after many scene of hysteric and reproach , condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept throughout our married life ? She wa considerably older than I , and besides , she always kept a clove or something in her mouth . There wa so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too , of a sort , a to tell her straight out that I couldn ’ t be absolutely faithful to her . This confession drove her to frenzy , but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness . She thought it showed I wa unwilling to deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman , you know , that ’ s the first consideration . After many tear an unwritten contract wa drawn up between u : first , that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband ; secondly , that I would never absent myself without her permission ; thirdly , that I would never set up a permanent mistress ; fourthly , in return for this , Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservant , but only with her secret knowledge ; fifthly , God forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class ; sixthly , in case I -- which God forbid -- should be visited by a great serious passion I wa bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna . On this last score , however , Marfa Petrovna wa fairly at ease . She wa a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me a a dissolute profligate incapable of real love . But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different thing , and that ’ s where the trouble came in . But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinion and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about u . I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone ’ s . Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that wa ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna . She certainly had some very ridiculous way , but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the innumerable woe of which I wa the cause . Well , and that ’ s enough , I think , by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife of a most tender husband . When we quarrelled , I usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain it object , it influenced her , it pleased her , indeed . These were time when she wa positively proud of me . But your sister she couldn ’ t put up with , anyway . And however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house a a governess . My explanation is that Marfa Petrovna wa an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself -- literally fell in love -- with your sister . Well , little wonder -- look at Avdotya Romanovna ! I saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think , I resolved not to look at her even . But Avdotya Romanovna herself made the first step , would you believe it ? Would you believe it too that Marfa Petrovna wa positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister , for my careless reception of her continual adoring praise of Avdotya Romanovna . I don ’ t know what it wa she wanted ! Well , of course , Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna every detail about me . She had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secret and continually complaining of me ; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new friend ? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumour that were current about me .... I don ’ t mind betting that you too have heard something of the sort already ? ” “ I have . Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child . Is that true ? ” “ Don ’ t refer to those vulgar tale , I beg , ” said Svidrigaïlov with disgust and annoyance . “ If you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy , I will tell you one day , but now ... ” “ I wa told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly. ” “ I beg you to drop the subject , ” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with obvious impatience . “ Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe ? ... you told me about it yourself. ” Raskolnikov felt more and more irritated . Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look . But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civilly : “ Yes , it wa . I see that you , too , are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity . Upon my soul ! I see that I really might pas for a romantic figure with some people . Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me . I dare not guess what impression it made on her , but in any case it worked in my interest . With all Avdotya Romanovna ’ s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect -- she did at least feel pity for me , pity for a lost soul . And if once a girl ’ s heart is moved to _pity_ , it ’ s more dangerous than anything . She is bound to want to ‘ save him , ’ to bring him to his sens , and lift him up and draw him to nobler aim , and restore him to new life and usefulness -- well , we all know how far such dream can go . I saw at once that the bird wa flying into the cage of herself . And I too made ready . I think you are frowning , Rodion Romanovitch ? There ’ s no need . As you know , it all ended in smoke . ( Hang it all , what a lot I am drinking ! ) Do you know , I always , from the very beginning , regretted that it wasn ’ t your sister ’ s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D. , a the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia Minor . She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincer . And she would have gone to it of herself . And in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty year living on root and ecstasy and vision . She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone , and if she can ’ t get her torture , she ’ ll throw herself out of a window . I ’ ve heard something of a Mr. Razumihin -- he ’ s said to be a sensible fellow ; his surname suggests it , indeed . He ’ s probably a divinity student . Well , he ’ d better look after your sister ! I believe I understand her , and I am proud of it . But at the beginning of an acquaintance , a you know , one is apt to be more heedless and stupid . One doesn ’ t see clearly . Hang it all , why is she so handsome ? It ’ s not my fault . In fact , it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire . Avdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste , incredibly and phenomenally so . Take note , I tell you this about your sister a a fact . She is almost morbidly chaste , in spite of her broad intelligence , and it will stand in her way . There happened to be a girl in the house then , Parasha , a black-eyed wench , whom I had never seen before -- she had just come from another village -- very pretty , but incredibly stupid : she burst into tear , wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal . One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eye _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha alone . It wa almost our first conversation by ourselves . I , of course , wa only too pleased to obey her wish , tried to appear disconcerted , embarrassed , in fact played my part not badly . Then came interview , mysterious conversation , exhortation , entreaty , supplication , even tear -- would you believe it , even tear ? Think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girl to ! I , of course , threw it all on my destiny , posed a hungering and thirsting for light , and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart , a weapon which never fails one . It ’ s the well-known resource -- flattery . Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery . If there ’ s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth , it lead to a discord , and that lead to trouble . But if all , to the last note , is false in flattery , it is just a agreeable , and is heard not without satisfaction . It may be a coarse satisfaction , but still a satisfaction . And however coarse the flattery , at least half will be sure to seem true . That ’ s so for all stage of development and class of society . A vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery . I can never remember without laughter how I once seduced a lady who wa devoted to her husband , her child , and her principle . What fun it wa and how little trouble ! And the lady really had principle -- of her own , anyway . All my tactic lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity . I flattered her shamelessly , and a soon a I succeeded in getting a pressure of the hand , even a glance from her , I would reproach myself for having snatched it by force , and would declare that she had resisted , so that I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled . I maintained that she wa so innocent that she could not foresee my treachery , and yielded to me unconsciously , unawares , and so on . In fact , I triumphed , while my lady remained firmly convinced that she wa innocent , chaste , and faithful to all her duty and obligation and had succumbed quite by accident . And how angry she wa with me when I explained to her at last that it wa my sincere conviction that she wa just a eager a I . Poor Marfa Petrovna wa awfully weak on the side of flattery , and if I had only cared to , I might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime . ( I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much . ) I hope you won ’ t be angry if I mention now that I wa beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna . But I wa stupid and impatient and spoiled it all . Avdotya Romanovna had several time -- and one time in particular -- been greatly displeased by the expression of my eye , would you believe it ? There wa sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it wa hateful to her . No need to go into detail , but we parted . There I acted stupidly again . I fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and effort to convert me ; Parasha came on to the scene again , and not she alone ; in fact there wa a tremendous to-do . Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , if you could only see how your sister ’ s eye can flash sometimes ! Never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine . I am speaking the truth . I assure you that this glance ha haunted my dream ; the very rustle of her dress wa more than I could stand at last . I really began to think that I might become epileptic . I could never have believed that I could be moved to such a frenzy . It wa essential , indeed , to be reconciled , but by then it wa impossible . And imagine what I did then ! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy ! Never undertake anything in a frenzy , Rodion Romanovitch . I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna wa after all a beggar ( ach , excuse me , that ’ s not the word ... but doe it matter if it express the meaning ? ) , that she lived by her work , that she had her mother and you to keep ( ach , hang it , you are frowning again ) , and I resolved to offer her all my money -- thirty thousand rouble I could have realised then -- if she would run away with me here , to Petersburg . Of course I should have vowed eternal love , rapture , and so on . Do you know , I wa so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat and to marry herself , it would have been done at once ! But it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already . You can fancy how frantic I wa when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney , Luzhin , and had almost made a match between them -- which would really have been just the same thing a I wa proposing . Wouldn ’ t it ? Wouldn ’ t it ? I notice that you ’ ve begun to be very attentive ... you interesting young man .... ” Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently . He wa flushed . Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost unconsciously wa affecting him -- and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity . He felt very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov . “ Well , after what you have said , I am fully convinced that you have come to Petersburg with design on my sister , ” he said directly to Svidrigaïlov , in order to irritate him further . “ Oh , nonsense , ” said Svidrigaïlov , seeming to rouse himself . “ Why , I told you ... besides your sister can ’ t endure me. ” “ Yes , I am certain that she can ’ t , but that ’ s not the point. ” “ Are you so sure that she can ’ t ? ” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eye and smiled mockingly . “ You are right , she doesn ’ t love me , but you can never be sure of what ha passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress . There ’ s always a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two . Will you answer for it that Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion ? ” “ From some word you ’ ve dropped , I notice that you still have design -- and of course evil one -- on Dounia and mean to carry them out promptly. ” “ What , have I dropped word like that ? ” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve dismay , taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his design . “ Why , you are dropping them even now . Why are you so frightened ? What are you so afraid of now ? ” “ Me -- afraid ? Afraid of you ? You have rather to be afraid of me , _cher ami_ . But what nonsense .... I ’ ve drunk too much though , I see that . I wa almost saying too much again . Damn the wine ! Hi ! there , water ! ” He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window . Philip brought the water . “ That ’ s all nonsense ! ” said Svidrigaïlov , wetting a towel and putting it to his head . “ But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicion . Do you know that I am going to get married ? ” “ You told me so before. ” “ Did I ? I ’ ve forgotten . But I couldn ’ t have told you so for certain for I had not even seen my betrothed ; I only meant to . But now I really have a betrothed and it ’ s a settled thing , and if it weren ’ t that I have business that can ’ t be put off , I would have taken you to see them at once , for I should like to ask your advice . Ach , hang it , only ten minute left ! See , look at the watch . But I must tell you , for it ’ s an interesting story , my marriage , in it own way . Where are you off to ? Going again ? ” “ No , I ’ m not going away now. ” “ Not at all ? We shall see . I ’ ll take you there , I ’ ll show you my betrothed , only not now . For you ’ ll soon have to be off . You have to go to the right and I to the left . Do you know that Madame Resslich , the woman I am lodging with now , eh ? I know what you ’ re thinking , that she ’ s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter . Come , are you listening ? She arranged it all for me . You ’ re bored , she said , you want something to fill up your time . For , you know , I am a gloomy , depressed person . Do you think I ’ m light-hearted ? No , I ’ m gloomy . I do no harm , but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three day at a time . And that Resslich is a sly hussy , I tell you . I know what she ha got in her mind ; she think I shall get sick of it , abandon my wife and depart , and she ’ ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her -- in our class , of course , or higher . She told me the father wa a broken-down retired official , who ha been sitting in a chair for the last three year with his leg paralysed . The mamma , she said , wa a sensible woman . There is a son serving in the province , but he doesn ’ t help ; there is a daughter , who is married , but she doesn ’ t visit them . And they ’ ve two little nephew on their hand , a though their own child were not enough , and they ’ ve taken from school their youngest daughter , a girl who ’ ll be sixteen in another month , so that then she can be married . She wa for me . We went there . How funny it wa ! I present myself -- a landowner , a widower , of a well-known name , with connection , with a fortune . What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen ? Who think of that ? But it ’ s fascinating , isn ’ t it ? It is fascinating , ha-ha ! You should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma . It wa worth paying to have seen me at that moment . She come in , curtsey , you can fancy , still in a short frock -- an unopened bud ! Flushing like a sunset -- she had been told , no doubt . I don ’ t know how you feel about female face , but to my mind these sixteen year , these childish eye , shyness and tear of bashfulness are better than beauty ; and she is a perfect little picture , too . Fair hair in little curl , like a lamb ’ s , full little rosy lip , tiny foot , a charmer ! ... Well , we made friend . I told them I wa in a hurry owing to domestic circumstance , and the next day , that is the day before yesterday , we were betrothed . When I go now I take her on my knee at once and keep her there .... Well , she flush like a sunset and I kiss her every minute . Her mamma of course impress on her that this is her husband and that this must be so . It ’ s simply delicious ! The present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage . Here you have what is called _la nature et la vérité_ , ha-ha ! I ’ ve talked to her twice , she is far from a fool . Sometimes she steal a look at me that positively scorch me . Her face is like Raphael ’ s Madonna . You know , the Sistine Madonna ’ s face ha something fantastic in it , the face of mournful religious ecstasy . Haven ’ t you noticed it ? Well , she ’ s something in that line . The day after we ’ d been betrothed , I bought her present to the value of fifteen hundred rouble -- a set of diamond and another of pearl and a silver dressing-case a large a this , with all sort of thing in it , so that even my Madonna ’ s face glowed . I sat her on my knee , yesterday , and I suppose rather too unceremoniously -- she flushed crimson and the tear started , but she didn ’ t want to show it . We were left alone , she suddenly flung herself on my neck ( for the first time of her own accord ) , put her little arm round me , kissed me , and vowed that she would be an obedient , faithful , and good wife , would make me happy , would devote all her life , every minute of her life , would sacrifice everything , everything , and that all she asks in return is my _respect_ , and that she want ‘ nothing , nothing more from me , no presents. ’ You ’ ll admit that to hear such a confession , alone , from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock , with little curl , with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheek and tear of enthusiasm in her eye is rather fascinating ! Isn ’ t it fascinating ? It ’ s worth paying for , isn ’ t it ? Well ... listen , we ’ ll go to see my betrothed , only not just now ! ” “ The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality ! Will you really make such a marriage ? ” “ Why , of course . Everyone think of himself , and he life most gaily who know best how to deceive himself . Ha-ha ! But why are you so keen about virtue ? Have mercy on me , my good friend . I am a sinful man . Ha-ha-ha ! ” “ But you have provided for the child of Katerina Ivanovna . Though ... though you had your own reason .... I understand it all now. ” “ I am always fond of child , very fond of them , ” laughed Svidrigaïlov . “ I can tell you one curious instance of it . The first day I came here I visited various haunt , after seven year I simply rushed at them . You probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friend . I shall do without them a long a I can . Do you know , when I wa with Marfa Petrovna in the country , I wa haunted by the thought of these place where anyone who know his way about can find a great deal . Yes , upon my soul ! The peasant have vodka , the educated young people , shut out from activity , waste themselves in impossible dream and vision and are crippled by theory ; Jews have sprung up and are amassing money , and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery . From the first hour the town reeked of it familiar odour . I chanced to be in a frightful den -- I like my den dirty -- it wa a dance , so called , and there wa a _cancan_ such a I never saw in my day . Yes , there you have progress . All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen , nicely dressed , dancing with a specialist in that line , with another one _vis-à-vis_ . Her mother wa sitting on a chair by the wall . You can ’ t fancy what a _cancan_ that wa ! The girl wa ashamed , blushed , at last felt insulted , and began to cry . Her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her ; everyone laughed and -- I like your public , even the _cancan_ public -- they laughed and shouted , ‘ Serves her right -- serf her right ! Shouldn ’ t bring child ! ’ Well , it ’ s not my business whether that consoling reflection wa logical or not . I at once fixed on my plan , sat down by the mother , and began by saying that I too wa a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and that they couldn ’ t distinguish decent folk and treat them with respect , gave her to understand that I had plenty of money , offered to take them home in my carriage . I took them home and got to know them . They were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country . She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance a an honour . I found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business . I proffered my service and money . I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake , believing that it wa a genuine dancing class . I offered to assist in the young girl ’ s education in French and dancing . My offer wa accepted with enthusiasm a an honour -- and we are still friendly .... If you like , we ’ ll go and see them , only not just now. ” “ Stop ! Enough of your vile , nasty anecdote , depraved vile , sensual man ! ” “ Schiller , you are a regular Schiller ! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher ? _ But you know I shall tell you these thing on purpose , for the pleasure of hearing your outcry ! ” “ I dare say . I can see I am ridiculous myself , ” muttered Raskolnikov angrily . Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily ; finally he called Philip , paid his bill , and began getting up . “ I say , but I am drunk , _assez causé_ , ” he said . “ It ’ s been a pleasure. ” “ I should rather think it must be a pleasure ! ” cried Raskolnikov , getting up . “ No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to describe such adventure with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind -- especially under such circumstance and to such a man a me .... It ’ s stimulating ! ” “ Well , if you come to that , ” Svidrigaïlov answered , scrutinising Raskolnikov with some surprise , “ if you come to that , you are a thorough cynic yourself . You ’ ve plenty to make you so , anyway . You can understand a great deal ... and you can do a great deal too . But enough . I sincerely regret not having had more talk with you , but I shan ’ t lose sight of you .... Only wait a bit. ” Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant . Raskolnikov walked out after him . Svidrigaïlov wa not however very drunk , the wine had affected him for a moment , but it wa passing off every minute . He wa preoccupied with something of importance and wa frowning . He wa apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something . His manner to Raskolnikov had changed during the last few minute , and he wa ruder and more sneering every moment . Raskolnikov noticed all this , and he too wa uneasy . He became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him . They came out on to the pavement . “ You go to the right , and I to the left , or if you like , the other way . Only _adieu , mon plaisir_ , may we meet again. ” And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market . CHAPTER V Raskolnikov walked after him . “ What ’ s this ? ” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round , “ I thought I said ... ” “ It mean that I am not going to lose sight of you now. ” “ What ? ” Both stood still and gazed at one another , a though measuring their strength . “ From all your half tipsy story , ” Raskolnikov observed harshly , “ I am _positive_ that you have not given up your design on my sister , but are pursuing them more actively than ever . I have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning . You have hardly been able to sit still all this time .... You may have unearthed a wife on the way , but that mean nothing . I should like to make certain myself. ” Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain . “ Upon my word ! I ’ ll call the police ! ” “ Call away ! ” Again they stood for a minute facing each other . At last Svidrigaïlov ’ s face changed . Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov wa not frightened at his threat , he assumed a mirthful and friendly air . “ What a fellow ! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair , though I am devoured by curiosity . It ’ s a fantastic affair . I ’ ve put it off till another time , but you ’ re enough to rouse the dead .... Well , let u go , only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment , to get some money ; then I shall lock up the flat , take a cab and go to spend the evening at the Islands . Now , now are you going to follow me ? ” “ I ’ m coming to your lodging , not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna , to say I ’ m sorry not to have been at the funeral. ” “ That ’ s a you like , but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home . She ha taken the three child to an old lady of high rank , the patroness of some orphan asylum , whom I used to know year ago . I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three child of Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution a well . I told her too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail , suppressing nothing . It produced an indescribable effect on her . That ’ s why Sofya Semyonovna ha been invited to call to-day at the X . Hotel where the lady is staying for the time. ” “ No matter , I ’ ll come all the same. ” “ As you like , it ’ s nothing to me , but I won ’ t come with you ; here we are at home . By the way , I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with question ... you understand ? It struck you a extraordinary ; I don ’ t mind betting it ’ s that . Well , it teach one to show delicacy ! ” “ And to listen at door ! ” “ Ah , that ’ s it , is it ? ” laughed Svidrigaïlov . “ Yes , I should have been surprised if you had let that pas after all that ha happened . Ha-ha ! Though I did understand something of the prank you had been up to and were telling Sofya Semyonovna about , what wa the meaning of it ? Perhaps I am quite behind the time and can ’ t understand . For goodness ’ sake , explain it , my dear boy . Expound the latest theory ! ” “ You couldn ’ t have heard anything . You ’ re making it all up ! ” “ But I ’ m not talking about that ( though I did hear something ) . No , I ’ m talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now . The Schiller in you is in revolt every moment , and now you tell me not to listen at door . If that ’ s how you feel , go and inform the police that you had this mischance : you made a little mistake in your theory . But if you are convinced that one mustn ’ t listen at door , but one may murder old woman at one ’ s pleasure , you ’ d better be off to America and make haste . Run , young man ! There may still be time . I ’ m speaking sincerely . Haven ’ t you the money ? I ’ ll give you the fare. ” “ I ’ m not thinking of that at all , ” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust . “ I understand ( but don ’ t put yourself out , don ’ t discus it if you don ’ t want to ) . I understand the question you are worrying over -- moral one , aren ’ t they ? Duties of citizen and man ? Lay them all aside . They are nothing to you now , ha-ha ! You ’ ll say you are still a man and a citizen . If so you ought not to have got into this coil . It ’ s no use taking up a job you are not fit for . Well , you ’ d better shoot yourself , or don ’ t you want to ? ” “ You seem trying to enrage me , to make me leave you. ” “ What a queer fellow ! But here we are . Welcome to the staircase . You see , that ’ s the way to Sofya Semyonovna . Look , there is no one at home . Don ’ t you believe me ? Ask Kapernaumov . She leaf the key with him . Here is Madame de Kapernaumov herself . Hey , what ? She is rather deaf . Has she gone out ? Where ? Did you hear ? She is not in and won ’ t be till late in the evening probably . Well , come to my room ; you wanted to come and see me , didn ’ t you ? Here we are . Madame Resslich ’ s not at home . She is a woman who is always busy , an excellent woman I assure you .... She might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible . Now , see ! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau -- see what a lot I ’ ve got of them still -- this one will be turned into cash to-day . I mustn ’ t waste any more time . The bureau is locked , the flat is locked , and here we are again on the stair . Shall we take a cab ? I ’ m going to the Islands . Would you like a lift ? I ’ ll take this carriage . Ah , you refuse ? You are tired of it ! Come for a drive ! I believe it will come on to rain . Never mind , we ’ ll put down the hood .... ” Svidrigaïlov wa already in the carriage . Raskolnikov decided that his suspicion were at least for that moment unjust . Without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market . If he had only turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a hundred pace off , dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement . But he had turned the corner and could see nothing . Intense disgust drew him away from Svidrigaïlov . “ To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute , that depraved sensualist and blackguard ! ” he cried . Raskolnikov ’ s judgment wa uttered too lightly and hastily : there wa something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original , even a mysterious character . As concerned his sister , Raskolnikov wa convinced that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace . But it wa too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this . When he wa alone , he had not gone twenty pace before he sank , a usual , into deep thought . On the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water . And his sister wa standing close by him . He met her at the entrance to the bridge , but passed by without seeing her . Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and wa struck with dismay . She stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not . Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the Hay Market . He seemed to be approaching cautiously . He did not go on to the bridge , but stood aside on the pavement , doing all he could to avoid Raskolnikov ’ s seeing him . He had observed Dounia for some time and had been making sign to her . She fancied he wa signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother , but to come to him . That wa what Dounia did . She stole by her brother and went up to Svidrigaïlov . “ Let u make haste away , ” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her , “ I don ’ t want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting . I must tell you I ’ ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by , where he looked me up and I had great difficulty in getting rid of him . He ha somehow heard of my letter to you and suspect something . It wasn ’ t you who told him , of course , but if not you , who then ? ” “ Well , we ’ ve turned the corner now , ” Dounia interrupted , “ and my brother won ’ t see u . I have to tell you that I am going no further with you . Speak to me here . You can tell it all in the street. ” “ In the first place , I can ’ t say it in the street ; secondly , you must hear Sofya Semyonovna too ; and , thirdly , I will show you some paper .... Oh well , if you won ’ t agree to come with me , I shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once . But I beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother ’ s is entirely in my keeping. ” Dounia stood still , hesitating , and looked at Svidrigaïlov with searching eye . “ What are you afraid of ? ” he observed quietly . “ The town is not the country . And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you. ” “ Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna ? ” “ No , I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now . But most likely she is . She ha buried her stepmother to-day : she is not likely to go visiting on such a day . For the time I don ’ t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you . The slightest indiscretion is a bad a betrayal in a thing like this . I live there in that house , we are coming to it . That ’ s the porter of our house -- he know me very well ; you see , he ’ s bowing ; he see I ’ m coming with a lady and no doubt he ha noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious . Excuse my putting thing so coarsely . I haven ’ t a flat to myself ; Sofya Semyonovna ’ s room is next to mine -- she lodge in the next flat . The whole floor is let out in lodging . Why are you frightened like a child ? Am I really so terrible ? ” Svidrigaïlov ’ s lip were twisted in a condescending smile ; but he wa in no smiling mood . His heart wa throbbing and he could scarcely breathe . He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement . But Dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement , she wa so irritated by his remark that she wa frightened of him like a child and that he wa so terrible to her . “ Though I know that you are not a man ... of honour , I am not in the least afraid of you . Lead the way , ” she said with apparent composure , but her face wa very pale . Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia ’ s room . “ Allow me to inquire whether she is at home .... She is not . How unfortunate ! But I know she may come quite soon . If she ’ s gone out , it can only be to see a lady about the orphan . Their mother is dead .... I ’ ve been meddling and making arrangement for them . If Sofya Semyonovna doe not come back in ten minute , I will send her to you , to-day if you like . This is my flat . These are my two room . Madame Resslich , my landlady , ha the next room . Now , look this way . I will show you my chief piece of evidence : this door from my bedroom lead into two perfectly empty room , which are to let . Here they are ... You must look into them with some attention. ” Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished room . Dounia wa looking about her mistrustfully , but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the room . Yet there wa something to observe , for instance , that Svidrigaïlov ’ s flat wa exactly between two set of almost uninhabited apartment . His room were not entered directly from the passage , but through the landlady ’ s two almost empty room . Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom , Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty room that were to let . Dounia stopped in the doorway , not knowing what she wa called to look upon , but Svidrigaïlov hastened to explain . “ Look here , at this second large room . Notice that door , it ’ s locked . By the door stand a chair , the only one in the two room . I brought it from my room so a to listen more conveniently . Just the other side of the door is Sofya Semyonovna ’ s table ; she sat there talking to Rodion Romanovitch . And I sat here listening on two successive evening , for two hour each time -- and of course I wa able to learn something , what do you think ? ” “ You listened ? ” “ Yes , I did . Now come back to my room ; we can ’ t sit down here. ” He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her a chair . He sat down at the opposite side of the table , at least seven foot from her , but probably there wa the same glow in his eye which had once frightened Dounia so much . She shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully . It wa an involuntary gesture ; she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness . But the secluded position of Svidrigaïlov ’ s lodging had suddenly struck her . She wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home , but pride kept her from asking . Moreover , she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself . She wa in great distress . “ Here is your letter , ” she said , laying it on the table . “ Can it be true what you write ? You hint at a crime committed , you say , by my brother . You hint at it too clearly ; you daren ’ t deny it now . I must tell you that I ’ d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don ’ t believe a word of it . It ’ s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion . I know the story and why and how it wa invented . You can have no proof . You promised to prove it . Speak ! But let me warn you that I don ’ t believe you ! I don ’ t believe you ! ” Dounia said this , speaking hurriedly , and for an instant the colour rushed to her face . “ If you didn ’ t believe it , how could you risk coming alone to my room ? Why have you come ? Simply from curiosity ? ” “ Don ’ t torment me . Speak , speak ! ” “ There ’ s no denying that you are a brave girl . Upon my word , I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here . But he wa not with you nor anywhere near . I wa on the look-out . It ’ s spirited of you , it prof you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch . But everything is divine in you .... About your brother , what am I to say to you ? You ’ ve just seen him yourself . What did you think of him ? ” “ Surely that ’ s not the only thing you are building on ? ” “ No , not on that , but on his own word . He came here on two successive evening to see Sofya Semyonovna . I ’ ve shown you where they sat . He made a full confession to her . He is a murderer . He killed an old woman , a pawnbroker , with whom he had pawned thing himself . He killed her sister too , a pedlar woman called Lizaveta , who happened to come in while he wa murdering her sister . He killed them with an axe he brought with him . He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them . He took money and various thing .... He told all this , word for word , to Sofya Semyonovna , the only person who know his secret . But she ha had no share by word or deed in the murder ; she wa a horrified at it a you are now . Don ’ t be anxious , she won ’ t betray him. ” “ It can not be , ” muttered Dounia , with white lip . She gasped for breath . “ It can not be . There wa not the slightest cause , no sort of ground .... It ’ s a lie , a lie ! ” “ He robbed her , that wa the cause , he took money and thing . It ’ s true that by his own admission he made no use of the money or thing , but hid them under a stone , where they are now . But that wa because he dared not make use of them. ” “ But how could he steal , rob ? How could he dream of it ? ” cried Dounia , and she jumped up from the chair . “ Why , you know him , and you ’ ve seen him , can he be a thief ? ” She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov ; she had entirely forgotten her fear . “ There are thousand and million of combination and possibility , Avdotya Romanovna . A thief steal and know he is a scoundrel , but I ’ ve heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail . Who know , very likely he thought he wa doing a gentlemanly thing ! Of course I should not have believed it myself if I ’ d been told of it a you have , but I believe my own ear . He explained all the cause of it to Sofya Semyonovna too , but she did not believe her ear at first , yet she believed her own eye at last. ” “ What ... were the cause ? ” “ It ’ s a long story , Avdotya Romanovna . Here ’ s ... how shall I tell you ? -- A theory of a sort , the same one by which I for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right , a solitary wrongdoing and hundred of good deed ! It ’ s galling too , of course , for a young man of gift and overweening pride to know that if he had , for instance , a paltry three thousand , his whole career , his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand . Add to that , nervous irritability from hunger , from lodging in a hole , from rag , from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister ’ s and mother ’ s position too . Above all , vanity , pride and vanity , though goodness know he may have good quality too .... I am not blaming him , please don ’ t think it ; besides , it ’ s not my business . A special little theory came in too -- a theory of a sort -- dividing mankind , you see , into material and superior person , that is person to whom the law doe not apply owing to their superiority , who make law for the rest of mankind , the material , that is . It ’ s all right a a theory , _une théorie comme une autre_ . Napoleon attracted him tremendously , that is , what affected him wa that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing , but have overstepped the law without thinking about it . He seems to have fancied that he wa a genius too -- that is , he wa convinced of it for a time . He ha suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory , but wa incapable of boldly overstepping the law , and so he is not a man of genius . And that ’ s humiliating for a young man of any pride , in our day especially .... ” “ But remorse ? You deny him any moral feeling then ? Is he like that ? ” “ Ah , Avdotya Romanovna , everything is in a muddle now ; not that it wa ever in very good order . Russians in general are broad in their idea , Avdotya Romanovna , broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic , the chaotic . But it ’ s a misfortune to be broad without a special genius . Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject , sitting in the evening on the terrace after supper ? Why , you used to reproach me with breadth ! Who know , perhaps we were talking at the very time when he wa lying here thinking over his plan . There are no sacred tradition amongst u , especially in the educated class , Avdotya Romanovna . At the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of book or from some old chronicle . But those are for the most part the learned and all old fogey , so that it would be almost ill-bred in a man of society . You know my opinion in general , though . I never blame anyone . I do nothing at all , I persevere in that . But we ’ ve talked of this more than once before . I wa so happy indeed a to interest you in my opinion .... You are very pale , Avdotya Romanovna. ” “ I know his theory . I read that article of his about men to whom all is permitted . Razumihin brought it to me. ” “ Mr . Razumihin ? Your brother ’ s article ? In a magazine ? Is there such an article ? I didn ’ t know . It must be interesting . But where are you going , Avdotya Romanovna ? ” “ I want to see Sofya Semyonovna , ” Dounia articulated faintly . “ How do I go to her ? She ha come in , perhaps . I must see her at once . Perhaps she ... ” Avdotya Romanovna could not finish . Her breath literally failed her . “ Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night , at least I believe not . She wa to have been back at once , but if not , then she will not be in till quite late. ” “ Ah , then you are lying ! I see ... you were lying ... lying all the time .... I don ’ t believe you ! I don ’ t believe you ! ” cried Dounia , completely losing her head . Almost fainting , she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to give her . “ Avdotya Romanovna , what is it ? Control yourself ! Here is some water . Drink a little .... ” He sprinkled some water over her . Dounia shuddered and came to herself . “ It ha acted violently , ” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself , frowning . “ Avdotya Romanovna , calm yourself ! Believe me , he ha friend . We will save him . Would you like me to take him abroad ? I have money , I can get a ticket in three day . And a for the murder , he will do all sort of good deed yet , to atone for it . Calm yourself . He may become a great man yet . Well , how are you ? How do you feel ? ” “ Cruel man ! To be able to jeer at it ! Let me go ... ” “ Where are you going ? ” “ To him . Where is he ? Do you know ? Why is this door locked ? We came in at that door and now it is locked . When did you manage to lock it ? ” “ We couldn ’ t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject . I am far from jeering ; it ’ s simply that I ’ m sick of talking like this . But how can you go in such a state ? Do you want to betray him ? You will drive him to fury , and he will give himself up . Let me tell you , he is already being watched ; they are already on his track . You will simply be giving him away . Wait a little : I saw him and wa talking to him just now . He can still be saved . Wait a bit , sit down ; let u think it over together . I asked you to come in order to discus it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly . But do sit down ! ” “ How can you save him ? Can he really be saved ? ” Dounia sat down . Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her . “ It all depends on you , on you , on you alone , ” he began with glowing eye , almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the word for emotion . Dounia drew back from him in alarm . He too wa trembling all over . “ You ... one word from you , and he is saved . I ... I ’ ll save him . I have money and friend . I ’ ll send him away at once . I ’ ll get a passport , two passport , one for him and one for me . I have friend ... capable people .... If you like , I ’ ll take a passport for you ... for your mother .... What do you want with Razumihin ? I love you too .... I love you beyond everything .... Let me kiss the hem of your dress , let me , let me .... The very rustle of it is too much for me . Tell me , ‘ do that , ’ and I ’ ll do it . I ’ ll do everything . I will do the impossible . What you believe , I will believe . I ’ ll do anything -- anything ! Don ’ t , don ’ t look at me like that . Do you know that you are killing me ? ... ” He wa almost beginning to rave .... Something seemed suddenly to go to his head . Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door . “ Open it ! Open it ! ” she called , shaking the door . “ Open it ! Is there no one there ? ” Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself . His still trembling lip slowly broke into an angry mocking smile . “ There is no one at home , ” he said quietly and emphatically . “ The landlady ha gone out , and it ’ s waste of time to shout like that . You are only exciting yourself uselessly. ” “ Where is the key ? Open the door at once , at once , base man ! ” “ I have lost the key and can not find it. ” “ This is an outrage , ” cried Dounia , turning pale a death . She rushed to the furthest corner , where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table . She did not scream , but she fixed her eye on her tormentor and watched every movement he made . Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her . He wa positively composed , at least in appearance , but his face wa pale a before . The mocking smile did not leave his face . “ You spoke of outrage just now , Avdotya Romanovna . In that case you may be sure I ’ ve taken measure . Sofya Semyonovna is not at home . The Kapernaumovs are far away -- there are five locked room between . I am at least twice a strong a you are and I have nothing to fear , besides . For you could not complain afterwards . You surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother ? Besides , no one would believe you . How should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodging ? So that even if you do sacrifice your brother , you could prove nothing . It is very difficult to prove an assault , Avdotya Romanovna. ” “ Scoundrel ! ” whispered Dounia indignantly . “ As you like , but observe I wa only speaking by way of a general proposition . It ’ s my personal conviction that you are perfectly right -- violence is hateful . I only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if ... you were willing to save your brother of your own accord , a I suggest to you . You would be simply submitting to circumstance , to violence , in fact , if we must use that word . Think about it . Your brother ’ s and your mother ’ s fate are in your hand . I will be your slave ... all my life ... I will wait here. ” Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight step from Dounia . She had not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination . Besides , she knew him . Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver , cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table . Svidrigaïlov jumped up . “ Aha ! So that ’ s it , is it ? ” he cried , surprised but smiling maliciously . “ Well , that completely alters the aspect of affair . You ’ ve made thing wonderfully easier for me , Avdotya Romanovna . But where did you get the revolver ? Was it Mr. Razumihin ? Why , it ’ s my revolver , an old friend ! And how I ’ ve hunted for it ! The shooting lesson I ’ ve given you in the country have not been thrown away. ” “ It ’ s not your revolver , it belonged to Marfa Petrovna , whom you killed , wretch ! There wa nothing of yours in her house . I took it when I began to suspect what you were capable of . If you dare to advance one step , I swear I ’ ll kill you. ” She wa frantic . “ But your brother ? I ask from curiosity , ” said Svidrigaïlov , still standing where he wa . “ Inform , if you want to ! Don ’ t stir ! Don ’ t come nearer ! I ’ ll shoot ! You poisoned your wife , I know ; you are a murderer yourself ! ” She held the revolver ready . “ Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna ? ” “ You did ! You hinted it yourself ; you talked to me of poison .... I know you went to get it ... you had it in readiness .... It wa your doing .... It must have been your doing .... Scoundrel ! ” “ Even if that were true , it would have been for your sake ... you would have been the cause. ” “ You are lying ! I hated you always , always .... ” “ Oho , Avdotya Romanovna ! You seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda . I saw it in your eye . Do you remember that moonlight night , when the nightingale wa singing ? ” “ That ’ s a lie , ” there wa a flash of fury in Dounia ’ s eye , “ that ’ s a lie and a libel ! ” “ A lie ? Well , if you like , it ’ s a lie . I made it up . Women ought not to be reminded of such thing , ” he smiled . “ I know you will shoot , you pretty wild creature . Well , shoot away ! ” Dounia raised the revolver , and deadly pale , gazed at him , measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part . Her lower lip wa white and quivering and her big black eye flashed like fire . He had never seen her so handsome . The fire glowing in her eye at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there wa a pang of anguish in his heart . He took a step forward and a shot rang out . The bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind . He stood still and laughed softly . “ The wasp ha stung me . She aimed straight at my head . What ’ s this ? Blood ? ” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood , which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple . The bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin . Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in terror a in a sort of wild amazement . She seemed not to understand what she wa doing and what wa going on . “ Well , you missed ! Fire again , I ’ ll wait , ” said Svidrigaïlov softly , still smiling , but gloomily . “ If you go on like that , I shall have time to seize you before you cock again. ” Dounia started , quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it . “ Let me be , ” she cried in despair . “ I swear I ’ ll shoot again . I ... I ’ ll kill you. ” “ Well ... at three pace you can hardly help it . But if you don ’ t ... then. ” His eye flashed and he took two step forward . Dounia shot again : it missed fire . “ You haven ’ t loaded it properly . Never mind , you have another charge there . Get it ready , I ’ ll wait. ” He stood facing her , two pace away , waiting and gazing at her with wild determination , with feverishly passionate , stubborn , set eye . Dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go . “ And ... now , of course she would kill him , at two pace ! ” Suddenly she flung away the revolver . “ She ’ s dropped it ! ” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise , and he drew a deep breath . A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart -- perhaps not only the fear of death ; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment . It wa the deliverance from another feeling , darker and more bitter , which he could not himself have defined . He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist . She did not resist , but , trembling like a leaf , looked at him with suppliant eye . He tried to say something , but his lip moved without being able to utter a sound . “ Let me go , ” Dounia implored . Svidrigaïlov shuddered . Her voice now wa quite different . “ Then you don ’ t love me ? ” he asked softly . Dounia shook her head . “ And ... and you can ’ t ? Never ? ” he whispered in despair . “ Never ! ” There followed a moment of terrible , dumb struggle in the heart of Svidrigaïlov . He looked at her with an indescribable gaze . Suddenly he withdrew his arm , turned quickly to the window and stood facing it . Another moment passed . “ Here ’ s the key. ” He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him , without turning or looking at Dounia . “ Take it ! Make haste ! ” He looked stubbornly out of the window . Dounia went up to the table to take the key . “ Make haste ! Make haste ! ” repeated Svidrigaïlov , still without turning or moving . But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that “ make haste. ” Dounia understood it , snatched up the key , flew to the door , unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room . A minute later , beside herself , she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge . Svidrigaïlov remained three minute standing at the window . At last he slowly turned , looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead . A strange smile contorted his face , a pitiful , sad , weak smile , a smile of despair . The blood , which wa already getting dry , smeared his hand . He looked angrily at it , then wetted a towel and washed his temple . The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye . He picked it up and examined it . It wa a little pocket three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction . There were still two charge and one capsule left in it . It could be fired again . He thought a little , put the revolver in his pocket , took his hat and went out . CHAPTER VI He spent that evening till ten o ’ clock going from one low haunt to another . Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song , how a certain “ villain and tyrant , ” “ began kissing Katia. ” Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singer and the waiter and two little clerk . He wa particularly drawn to these clerk by the fact that they both had crooked nose , one bent to the left and the other to the right . They took him finally to a pleasure garden , where he paid for their entrance . There wa one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bush in the garden , besides a “ Vauxhall , ” which wa in reality a drinking-bar where tea too wa served , and there were a few green table and chair standing round it . A chorus of wretched singer and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public . The clerk quarrelled with some other clerk and a fight seemed imminent . Svidrigaïlov wa chosen to decide the dispute . He listened to them for a quarter of an hour , but they shouted so loud that there wa no possibility of understanding them . The only fact that seemed certain wa that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew , but would not share the spoil with his companion . Finally it appeared that the stolen object wa a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall . It wa missed and the affair began to seem troublesome . Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon , got up , and walked out of the garden . It wa about six o ’ clock . He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearance than anything . It wa a dark and stifling evening . Threatening storm-clouds came over the sky about ten o ’ clock . There wa a clap of thunder , and the rain came down like a waterfall . The water fell not in drop , but beat on the earth in stream . There were flash of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five . Drenched to the skin , he went home , locked himself in , opened the bureau , took out all his money and tore up two or three paper . Then , putting the money in his pocket , he wa about to change his clothes , but , looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain , he gave up the idea , took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door . He went straight to Sonia . She wa at home . She wa not alone : the four Kapernaumov child were with her . She wa giving them tea . She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence , looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes . The child all ran away at once in indescribable terror . Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him . She timidly prepared to listen . “ I may be going to America , Sofya Semyonovna , ” said Svidrigaïlov , “ and a I am probably seeing you for the last time , I have come to make some arrangement . Well , did you see the lady to-day ? I know what she said to you , you need not tell me. ” ( Sonia made a movement and blushed . ) “ Those people have their own way of doing thing . As to your sister and your brother , they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I ’ ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgment . You had better take charge of the receipt , in case anything happens . Here , take them ! Well now , that ’ s settled . Here are three 5-per-cent bond to the value of three thousand rouble . Take those for yourself , entirely for yourself , and let that be strictly between ourselves , so that no one know of it , whatever you hear . You will need the money , for to go on living in the old way , Sofya Semyonovna , is bad , and besides there is no need for it now. ” “ I am so much indebted to you , and so are the child and my stepmother , ” said Sonia hurriedly , “ and if I ’ ve said so little ... please don ’ t consider ... ” “ That ’ s enough ! that ’ s enough ! ” “ But a for the money , Arkady Ivanovitch , I am very grateful to you , but I don ’ t need it now . I can always earn my own living . Don ’ t think me ungrateful . If you are so charitable , that money .... ” “ It ’ s for you , for you , Sofya Semyonovna , and please don ’ t waste word over it . I haven ’ t time for it . You will want it . Rodion Romanovitch ha two alternative : a bullet in the brain or Siberia. ” ( Sonia looked wildly at him , and started . ) “ Don ’ t be uneasy , I know all about it from himself and I am not a gossip ; I won ’ t tell anyone . It wa good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess . It would be much better for him . Well , if it turn out to be Siberia , he will go and you will follow him . That ’ s so , isn ’ t it ? And if so , you ’ ll need money . You ’ ll need it for him , do you understand ? Giving it to you is the same a my giving it to him . Besides , you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what ’ s owing . I heard you . How can you undertake such obligation so heedlessly , Sofya Semyonovna ? It wa Katerina Ivanovna ’ s debt and not yours , so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman . You can ’ t get through the world like that . If you are ever questioned about me -- to-morrow or the day after you will be asked -- don ’ t say anything about my coming to see you now and don ’ t show the money to anyone or say a word about it . Well , now good-bye. ” ( He got up . ) “ My greeting to Rodion Romanovitch . By the way , you ’ d better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin ’ s keeping . You know Mr. Razumihin ? Of course you do . He ’ s not a bad fellow . Take it to him to-morrow or ... when the time come . And till then , hide it carefully. ” Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov . She longed to speak , to ask a question , but for the first moment she did not dare and did not know how to begin . “ How can you ... how can you be going now , in such rain ? ” “ Why , be starting for America , and be stopped by rain ! Ha , ha ! Good-bye , Sofya Semyonovna , my dear ! Live and live long , you will be of use to others . By the way ... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greeting to him . Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greeting . Be sure to. ” He went out , leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension . It appeared afterwards that on the same evening , at twenty past eleven , he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit . The rain still persisted . Drenched to the skin , he walked into the little flat where the parent of his betrothed lived , in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Island . He knocked some time before he wa admitted , and his visit at first caused great perturbation ; but Svidrigaïlov could be very fascinating when he liked , so that the first , and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parent that Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he wa doing vanished immediately . The decrepit father wa wheeled in to see Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother , who a usual began the conversation with various irrelevant question . She never asked a direct question , but began by smiling and rubbing her hand and then , if she were obliged to ascertain something -- for instance , when Svidrigaïlov would like to have the wedding -- she would begin by interested and almost eager question about Paris and the court life there , and only by degree brought the conversation round to Third Street . On other occasion this had of course been very impressive , but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient , and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once , though he had been informed , to begin with , that she had already gone to bed . The girl of course appeared . Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he wa obliged by very important affair to leave Petersburg for a time , and therefore brought her fifteen thousand rouble and begged her accept them a a present from him , a he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding . The logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight wa not made clear . But it all went off very well ; even the inevitable ejaculation of wonder and regret , the inevitable question were extraordinarily few and restrained . On the other hand , the gratitude expressed wa most glowing and wa reinforced by tear from the most sensible of mother . Svidrigaïlov got up , laughed , kissed his betrothed , patted her cheek , declared he would soon come back , and noticing in her eye , together with childish curiosity , a sort of earnest dumb inquiry , reflected and kissed her again , though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mother . He went away , leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement , but the tender mamma , speaking quietly in a half whisper , settled some of the most important of their doubt , concluding that Svidrigaïlov wa a great man , a man of great affair and connection and of great wealth -- there wa no knowing what he had in his mind . He would start off on a journey and give away money just a the fancy took him , so that there wa nothing surprising about it . Of course it wa strange that he wa wet through , but Englishmen , for instance , are even more eccentric , and all these people of high society didn ’ t think of what wa said of them and didn ’ t stand on ceremony . Possibly , indeed , he came like that on purpose to show that he wa not afraid of anyone . Above all , not a word should be said about it , for God know what might come of it , and the money must be locked up , and it wa most fortunate that Fedosya , the cook , had not left the kitchen . And above all not a word must be said to that old cat , Madame Resslich , and so on and so on . They sat up whispering till two o ’ clock , but the girl went to bed much earlier , amazed and rather sorrowful . Svidrigaïlov meanwhile , exactly at midnight , crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland . The rain had ceased and there wa a roaring wind . He began shivering , and for one moment he gazed at the black water of the Little Neva with a look of special interest , even inquiry . But he soon felt it very cold , standing by the water ; he turned and went towards Y . Prospect . He walked along that endless street for a long time , almost half an hour , more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement , but continually looking for something on the right side of the street . He had noticed passing through this street lately that there wa a hotel somewhere towards the end , built of wood , but fairly large , and it name he remembered wa something like Adrianople . He wa not mistaken : the hotel wa so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark . It wa a long , blackened wooden building , and in spite of the late hour there were light in the window and sign of life within . He went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room . The latter , scanning Svidrigaïlov , pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance , at the end of the corridor , under the stair . There wa no other , all were occupied . The ragged fellow looked inquiringly . “ Is there tea ? ” asked Svidrigaïlov . “ Yes , sir. ” “ What else is there ? ” “ Veal , vodka , savouries. ” “ Bring me tea and veal. ” “ And you want nothing else ? ” he asked with apparent surprise . “ Nothing , nothing. ” The ragged man went away , completely disillusioned . “ It must be a nice place , ” thought Svidrigaïlov . “ How wa it I didn ’ t know it ? I expect I look a if I came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way . It would be interesting to know who stayed here ? ” He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully . It wa a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it ; it had one window ; the bed , which wa very dirty , and the plain-stained chair and table almost filled it up . The wall looked a though they were made of plank , covered with shabby paper , so torn and dusty that the pattern wa indistinguishable , though the general colour -- yellow -- could still be made out . One of the wall wa cut short by the sloping ceiling , though the room wa not an attic but just under the stair . Svidrigaïlov set down the candle , sat down on the bed and sank into thought . But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention . The murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room . He listened : someone wa upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding , but he heard only one voice . Svidrigaïlov got up , shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall ; he went up and peeped through . The room , which wa somewhat larger than his , had two occupant . One of them , a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face , wa standing in the pose of an orator , without his coat , with his leg wide apart to preserve his balance , and smiting himself on the breast . He reproached the other with being a beggar , with having no standing whatever . He declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked , and that only the finger of Providence see it all . The object of his reproach wa sitting in a chair , and had the air of a man who want dreadfully to sneeze , but can ’ t . He sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eye on the speaker , but obviously had not the slightest idea what he wa talking about and scarcely heard it . A candle wa burning down on the table ; there were wine-glasses , a nearly empty bottle of vodka , bread and cucumber , and glass with the dreg of stale tea . After gazing attentively at this , Svidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed . The ragged attendant , returning with the tea , could not resist asking him again whether he didn ’ t want anything more , and again receiving a negative reply , finally withdrew . Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself , but could not eat anything . He began to feel feverish . He took off his coat and , wrapping himself in the blanket , lay down on the bed . He wa annoyed . “ It would have been better to be well for the occasion , ” he thought with a smile . The room wa close , the candle burnt dimly , the wind wa roaring outside , he heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mouse and of leather . He lay in a sort of reverie : one thought followed another . He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something . “ It must be a garden under the window , ” he thought . “ There ’ s a sound of tree . How I dislike the sound of tree on a stormy night , in the dark ! They give one a horrid feeling. ” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now . This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he felt cold again a he had when standing there . “ I never have liked water , ” he thought , “ even in a landscape , ” and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea : “ Surely now all these question of taste and comfort ought not to matter , but I ’ ve become more particular , like an animal that pick out a special place ... for such an occasion . I ought to have gone into the Petrovsky Park ! I suppose it seemed dark , cold , ha-ha ! As though I were seeking pleasant sensation ! ... By the way , why haven ’ t I put out the candle ? ” he blew it out . “ They ’ ve gone to bed next door , ” he thought , not seeing the light at the crack . “ Well , now , Marfa Petrovna , now is the time for you to turn up ; it ’ s dark , and the very time and place for you . But now you won ’ t come ! ” He suddenly recalled how , an hour before carrying out his design on Dounia , he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin ’ s keeping . “ I suppose I really did say it , a Raskolnikov guessed , to tease myself . But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is ! He ’ s gone through a good deal . He may be a successful rogue in time when he ’ s got over his nonsense . But now he ’ s _too_ eager for life . These young men are contemptible on that point . But , hang the fellow ! Let him please himself , it ’ s nothing to do with me. ” He could not get to sleep . By degree Dounia ’ s image rose before him , and a shudder ran over him . “ No , I must give up all that now , ” he thought , rousing himself . “ I must think of something else . It ’ s queer and funny . I never had a great hatred for anyone , I never particularly desired to avenge myself even , and that ’ s a bad sign , a bad sign , a bad sign . I never liked quarrelling either , and never lost my temper -- that ’ s a bad sign too . And the promise I made her just now , too -- Damnation ! But -- who know ? -- perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow .... ” He ground his teeth and sank into silence again . Again Dounia ’ s image rose before him , just a she wa when , after shooting the first time , she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him , so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her . He recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her , how he had felt a pang at his heart ... “ Aïe ! Damnation , these thought again ! I must put it away ! ” He wa dozing off ; the feverish shiver had ceased , when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes . He started . “ Ugh ! hang it ! I believe it ’ s a mouse , ” he thought , “ that ’ s the veal I left on the table. ” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket , get up , get cold , but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again . He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle . Shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed : there wa nothing . He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet . He tried to catch it , but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzag without leaving the bed , slipped between his finger , ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow . He threw down the pillow , but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt . He trembled nervously and woke up . The room wa dark . He wa lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket a before . The wind wa howling under the window . “ How disgusting , ” he thought with annoyance . He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window . “ It ’ s better not to sleep at all , ” he decided . There wa a cold damp draught from the window , however ; without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it . He wa not thinking of anything and did not want to think . But one image rose after another , incoherent scrap of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind . He sank into drowsiness . Perhaps the cold , or the dampness , or the dark , or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the tree roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic . He kept dwelling on image of flower , he fancied a charming flower garden , a bright , warm , almost hot day , a holiday -- Trinity day . A fine , sumptuous country cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flower , with flower bed going round the house ; the porch , wreathed in climber , wa surrounded with bed of rose . A light , cool staircase , carpeted with rich rug , wa decorated with rare plant in china pot . He noticed particularly in the window nosegay of tender , white , heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright , green , thick long stalk . He wa reluctant to move away from them , but he went up the stair and came into a large , high drawing-room and again everywhere -- at the window , the door on to the balcony , and on the balcony itself -- were flower . The floor were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay , the window were open , a fresh , cool , light air came into the room . The bird were chirruping under the window , and in the middle of the room , on a table covered with a white satin shroud , stood a coffin . The coffin wa covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill ; wreath of flower surrounded it on all side . Among the flower lay a girl in a white muslin dress , with her arm crossed and pressed on her bosom , a though carved out of marble . But her loose fair hair wa wet ; there wa a wreath of rose on her head . The stern and already rigid profile of her face looked a though chiselled of marble too , and the smile on her pale lip wa full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal . Svidrigaïlov knew that girl ; there wa no holy image , no burning candle beside the coffin ; no sound of prayer : the girl had drowned herself . She wa only fourteen , but her heart wa broken . And she had destroyed herself , crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul , had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair , unheeded and brutally disregarded , on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled .... Svidrigaïlov came to himself , got up from the bed and went to the window . He felt for the latch and opened it . The wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest , only covered with his shirt , a though with frost . Under the window there must have been something like a garden , and apparently a pleasure garden . There , too , probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime . Now drop of rain flew in at the window from the tree and bush ; it wa dark a in a cellar , so that he could only just make out some dark blur of object . Svidrigaïlov , bending down with elbow on the window-sill , gazed for five minute into the darkness ; the boom of a cannon , followed by a second one , resounded in the darkness of the night . “ Ah , the signal ! The river is overflowing , ” he thought . “ By morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower part , flooding the basement and cellar . The cellar rat will swim out , and men will curse in the rain and wind a they drag their rubbish to their upper storey . What time is it now ? ” And he had hardly thought it when , somewhere near , a clock on the wall , ticking away hurriedly , struck three . “ Aha ! It will be light in an hour ! Why wait ? I ’ ll go out at once straight to the park . I ’ ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain , so that a soon a one ’ s shoulder touch it , million of drop drip on one ’ s head. ” He moved away from the window , shut it , lighted the candle , put on his waistcoat , his overcoat and his hat and went out , carrying the candle , into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sort of rubbish , to pay him for the room and leave the hotel . “ It ’ s the best minute ; I couldn ’ t choose a better. ” He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and wa just going to call out , when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive . He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl , not more than five year old , shivering and cry , with her clothes a wet a a soaking house-flannel . She did not seem afraid of Svidrigaïlov , but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eye . Now and then she sobbed a child do when they have been cry a long time , but are beginning to be comforted . The child ’ s face wa pale and tired , she wa numb with cold . “ How can she have come here ? She must have hidden here and not slept all night. ” He began questioning her . The child suddenly becoming animated , chattered away in her baby language , something about “ mammy ” and that “ mammy would beat her , ” and about some cup that she had “ bwoken. ” The child chattered on without stopping . He could only guess from what she said that she wa a neglected child , whose mother , probably a drunken cook , in the service of the hotel , whipped and frightened her ; that the child had broken a cup of her mother ’ s and wa so frightened that she had run away the evening before , had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain , at last had made her way in here , hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there , cry and trembling from the damp , the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it . He took her in his arm , went back to his room , sat her on the bed , and began undressing her . The torn shoe which she had on her stockingless foot were a wet a if they had been standing in a puddle all night . When he had undressed her , he put her on the bed , covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards . She fell asleep at once . Then he sank into dreary musing again . “ What folly to trouble myself , ” he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance . “ What idiocy ! ” In vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away . “ Damn the child ! ” he thought a he opened the door , but he turned again to see whether the child wa asleep . He raised the blanket carefully . The child wa sleeping soundly , she had got warm under the blanket , and her pale cheek were flushed . But strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheek of childhood . “ It ’ s a flush of fever , ” thought Svidrigaïlov . It wa like the flush from drinking , a though she had been given a full glass to drink . Her crimson lip were hot and glowing ; but what wa this ? He suddenly fancied that her long black eyelash were quivering , a though the lid were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink , a though the little girl were not asleep , but pretending . Yes , it wa so . Her lip parted in a smile . The corner of her mouth quivered , a though she were trying to control them . But now she quite gave up all effort , now it wa a grin , a broad grin ; there wa something shameless , provocative in that quite unchildish face ; it wa depravity , it wa the face of a harlot , the shameless face of a French harlot . Now both eye opened wide ; they turned a glowing , shameless glance upon him ; they laughed , invited him .... There wa something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh , in those eye , in such nastiness in the face of a child . “ What , at five year old ? ” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror . “ What doe it mean ? ” And now she turned to him , her little face all aglow , holding out her arm .... “ Accursed child ! ” Svidrigaïlov cried , raising his hand to strike her , but at that moment he woke up . He wa in the same bed , still wrapped in the blanket . The candle had not been lighted , and daylight wa streaming in at the window . “ I ’ ve had nightmare all night ! ” He got up angrily , feeling utterly shattered ; his bone ached . There wa a thick mist outside and he could see nothing . It wa nearly five . He had overslept himself ! He got up , put on his still damp jacket and overcoat . Feeling the revolver in his pocket , he took it out and then he sat down , took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few line in large letter . Reading them over , he sank into thought with his elbow on the table . The revolver and the notebook lay beside him . Some fly woke up and settled on the untouched veal , which wa still on the table . He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one . He tried till he wa tired , but could not catch it . At last , realising that he wa engaged in this interesting pursuit , he started , got up and walked resolutely out of the room . A minute later he wa in the street . A thick milky mist hung over the town . Svidrigaïlov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva . He wa picturing the water of the Little Neva swollen in the night , Petrovsky Island , the wet path , the wet grass , the wet tree and bush and at last the bush .... He began ill-humouredly staring at the house , trying to think of something else . There wa not a cabman or a passer-by in the street . The bright yellow , wooden , little house looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutter . The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver . From time to time he came across shop sign and read each carefully . At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house . A dirty , shivering dog crossed his path with it tail between it leg . A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards ; dead drunk , across the pavement . He looked at him and went on . A high tower stood up on the left . “ Bah ! ” he shouted , “ here is a place . Why should it be Petrovsky ? It will be in the presence of an official witness anyway .... ” He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there wa the big house with the tower . At the great closed gate of the house , a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them , wrapped in a grey soldier ’ s coat , with a copper Achilles helmet on his head . He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov . His face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection , which is so sourly printed on all face of Jewish race without exception . They both , Svidrigaïlov and Achilles , stared at each other for a few minute without speaking . At last it struck Achilles a irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three step from him , staring and not saying a word . “ What do you want here ? ” he said , without moving or changing his position . “ Nothing , brother , good morning , ” answered Svidrigaïlov . “ This isn ’ t the place. ” “ I am going to foreign part , brother. ” “ To foreign part ? ” “ To America. ” “ America. ” Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it . Achilles raised his eyebrow . “ I say , this is not the place for such joke ! ” “ Why shouldn ’ t it be the place ? ” “ Because it isn ’ t. ” “ Well , brother , I don ’ t mind that . It ’ s a good place . When you are asked , you just say he wa going , he said , to America. ” He put the revolver to his right temple . “ You can ’ t do it here , it ’ s not the place , ” cried Achilles , rousing himself , his eye growing bigger and bigger . Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger . CHAPTER VII The same day , about seven o ’ clock in the evening , Raskolnikov wa on his way to his mother ’ s and sister ’ s lodging -- the lodging in Bakaleyev ’ s house which Razumihin had found for them . The stair went up from the street . Raskolnikov walked with lagging step , a though still hesitating whether to go or not . But nothing would have turned him back : his decision wa taken . “ Besides , it doesn ’ t matter , they still know nothing , ” he thought , “ and they are used to thinking of me a eccentric. ” He wa appallingly dressed : his clothes torn and dirty , soaked with a night ’ s rain . His face wa almost distorted from fatigue , exposure , the inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hour . He had spent all the previous night alone , God know where . But anyway he had reached a decision . He knocked at the door which wa opened by his mother . Dounia wa not at home . Even the servant happened to be out . At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa speechless with joy and surprise ; then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room . “ Here you are ! ” she began , faltering with joy . “ Don ’ t be angry with me , Rodya , for welcoming you so foolishly with tear : I am laughing not cry . Did you think I wa cry ? No , I am delighted , but I ’ ve got into such a stupid habit of shedding tear . I ’ ve been like that ever since your father ’ s death . I cry for anything . Sit down , dear boy , you must be tired ; I see you are . Ah , how muddy you are. ” “ I wa in the rain yesterday , mother .... ” Raskolnikov began . “ No , no , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted , “ you thought I wa going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to ; don ’ t be anxious , I understand , I understand it all : now I ’ ve learned the way here and truly I see for myself that they are better . I ’ ve made up my mind once for all : how could I understand your plan and expect you to give an account of them ? God know what concern and plan you may have , or what idea you are hatching ; so it ’ s not for me to keep nudging your elbow , asking you what you are thinking about ? But , my goodness ! why am I running to and fro a though I were crazy ... ? I am reading your article in the magazine for the third time , Rodya . Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me . Directly I saw it I cried out to myself : ‘ There , foolish one , ’ I thought , ‘ that ’ s what he is busy about ; that ’ s the solution of the mystery ! Learned people are always like that . He may have some new idea in his head just now ; he is thinking them over and I worry him and upset him. ’ I read it , my dear , and of course there wa a great deal I did not understand ; but that ’ s only natural -- how should I ? ” “ Show me , mother. ” Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article . Incongruous a it wa with his mood and his circumstance , he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experience the first time he see himself in print ; besides , he wa only twenty-three . It lasted only a moment . After reading a few line he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish . He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding month . He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger . “ But , however foolish I may be , Rodya , I can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the leading -- if not the leading man -- in the world of Russian thought . And they dared to think you were mad ! You don ’ t know , but they really thought that . Ah , the despicable creature , how could they understand genius ! And Dounia , Dounia wa all but believing it -- what do you say to that ? Your father sent twice to magazine -- the first time poem ( I ’ ve got the manuscript and will show you ) and the second time a whole novel ( I begged him to let me copy it out ) and how we prayed that they should be taken -- they weren ’ t ! I wa breaking my heart , Rodya , six or seven day ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living . But now I see again how foolish I wa , for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent . No doubt you don ’ t care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matter .... ” “ Dounia ’ s not at home , mother ? ” “ No , Rodya . I often don ’ t see her ; she leaf me alone . Dmitri Prokofitch come to see me , it ’ s so good of him , and he always talk about you . He love you and respect you , my dear . I don ’ t say that Dounia is very wanting in consideration . I am not complaining . She ha her way and I have mine ; she seems to have got some secret of late and I never have any secret from you two . Of course , I am sure that Dounia ha far too much sense , and besides she love you and me ... but I don ’ t know what it will all lead to . You ’ ve made me so happy by coming now , Rodya , but she ha missed you by going out ; when she come in I ’ ll tell her : ‘ Your brother came in while you were out . Where have you been all this time ? ’ You mustn ’ t spoil me , Rodya , you know ; come when you can , but if you can ’ t , it doesn ’ t matter , I can wait . I shall know , anyway , that you are fond of me , that will be enough for me . I shall read what you write , I shall hear about you from everyone , and sometimes you ’ ll come yourself to see me . What could be better ? Here you ’ ve come now to comfort your mother , I see that. ” Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry . “ Here I am again ! Don ’ t mind my foolishness . My goodness , why am I sitting here ? ” she cried , jumping up . “ There is coffee and I don ’ t offer you any . Ah , that ’ s the selfishness of old age . I ’ ll get it at once ! ” “ Mother , don ’ t trouble , I am going at once . I haven ’ t come for that . Please listen to me. ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly . “ Mother , whatever happens , whatever you hear about me , whatever you are told about me , will you always love me a you do now ? ” he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart , a though not thinking of his word and not weighing them . “ Rodya , Rodya , what is the matter ? How can you ask me such a question ? Why , who will tell me anything about you ? Besides , I shouldn ’ t believe anyone , I should refuse to listen. ” “ I ’ ve come to assure you that I ’ ve always loved you and I am glad that we are alone , even glad Dounia is out , ” he went on with the same impulse . “ I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy , you must believe that your son love you now more than himself , and that all you thought about me , that I wa cruel and didn ’ t care about you , wa all a mistake . I shall never cease to love you .... Well , that ’ s enough : I thought I must do this and begin with this .... ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence , pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently . “ I don ’ t know what is wrong with you , Rodya , ” she said at last . “ I ’ ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see that there is a great sorrow in store for you , and that ’ s why you are miserable . I ’ ve foreseen it a long time , Rodya . Forgive me for speaking about it . I keep thinking about it and lie awake at night . Your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night , talking of nothing but you . I caught something , but I couldn ’ t make it out . I felt all the morning a though I were going to be hanged , waiting for something , expecting something , and now it ha come ! Rodya , Rodya , where are you going ? You are going away somewhere ? ” “ Yes. ” “ That ’ s what I thought ! I can come with you , you know , if you need me . And Dounia , too ; she love you , she love you dearly -- and Sofya Semyonovna may come with u if you like . You see , I am glad to look upon her a a daughter even ... Dmitri Prokofitch will help u to go together . But ... where ... are you going ? ” “ Good-bye , mother. ” “ What , to-day ? ” she cried , a though losing him for ever . “ I can ’ t stay , I must go now .... ” “ And can ’ t I come with you ? ” “ No , but kneel down and pray to God for me . Your prayer perhaps will reach Him. ” “ Let me bless you and sign you with the cross . That ’ s right , that ’ s right . Oh , God , what are we doing ? ” Yes , he wa glad , he wa very glad that there wa no one there , that he wa alone with his mother . For the first time after all those awful month his heart wa softened . He fell down before her , he kissed her foot and both wept , embracing . And she wa not surprised and did not question him this time . For some day she had realised that something awful wa happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him . “ Rodya , my darling , my first born , ” she said sobbing , “ now you are just a when you were little . You would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me . When your father wa living and we were poor , you comforted u simply by being with u and when I buried your father , how often we wept together at his grave and embraced , a now . And if I ’ ve been cry lately , it ’ s that my mother ’ s heart had a foreboding of trouble . The first time I saw you , that evening , you remember , a soon a we arrived here , I guessed simply from your eye . My heart sank at once , and to-day when I opened the door and looked at you , I thought the fatal hour had come . Rodya , Rodya , you are not going away to-day ? ” “ No ! ” “ You ’ ll come again ? ” “ Yes ... I ’ ll come. ” “ Rodya , don ’ t be angry , I don ’ t dare to question you . I know I mustn ’ t . Only say two word to me -- is it far where you are going ? ” “ Very far. ” “ What is awaiting you there ? Some post or career for you ? ” “ What God sends ... only pray for me. ” Raskolnikov went to the door , but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eye . Her face worked with terror . “ Enough , mother , ” said Raskolnikov , deeply regretting that he had come . “ Not for ever , it ’ s not yet for ever ? You ’ ll come , you ’ ll come to-morrow ? ” “ I will , I will , good-bye. ” He tore himself away at last . It wa a warm , fresh , bright evening ; it had cleared up in the morning . Raskolnikov went to his lodging ; he made haste . He wanted to finish all before sunset . He did not want to meet anyone till then . Going up the stair he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently . “ Can anyone have come to see me ? ” he wondered . He had a disgusted vision of Porfiry . But opening his door he saw Dounia . She wa sitting alone , plunged in deep thought , and looked a though she had been waiting a long time . He stopped short in the doorway . She rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him . Her eye , fixed upon him , betrayed horror and infinite grief . And from those eye alone he saw at once that she knew . “ Am I to come in or go away ? ” he asked uncertainly . “ I ’ ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna . We were both waiting for you . We thought that you would be sure to come there. ” Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair . “ I feel weak , Dounia , I am very tired ; and I should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself. ” He glanced at her mistrustfully . “ Where were you all night ? ” “ I don ’ t remember clearly . You see , sister , I wanted to make up my mind once for all , and several time I walked by the Neva , I remember that I wanted to end it all there , but ... I couldn ’ t make up my mind , ” he whispered , looking at her mistrustfully again . “ Thank God ! That wa just what we were afraid of , Sofya Semyonovna and I . Then you still have faith in life ? Thank God , thank God ! ” Raskolnikov smiled bitterly . “ I haven ’ t faith , but I have just been weeping in mother ’ s arm ; I haven ’ t faith , but I have just asked her to pray for me . I don ’ t know how it is , Dounia , I don ’ t understand it. ” “ Have you been at mother ’ s ? Have you told her ? ” cried Dounia , horror-stricken . “ Surely you haven ’ t done that ? ” “ No , I didn ’ t tell her ... in word ; but she understood a great deal . She heard you talking in your sleep . I am sure she half understands it already . Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her . I don ’ t know why I did go . I am a contemptible person , Dounia. ” “ A contemptible person , but ready to face suffering ! You are , aren ’ t you ? ” “ Yes , I am going . At once . Yes , to escape the disgrace I thought of drowning myself , Dounia , but a I looked into the water , I thought that if I had considered myself strong till now I ’ d better not be afraid of disgrace , ” he said , hurrying on . “ It ’ s pride , Dounia. ” “ Pride , Rodya. ” There wa a gleam of fire in his lustreless eye ; he seemed to be glad to think that he wa still proud . “ You don ’ t think , sister , that I wa simply afraid of the water ? ” he asked , looking into her face with a sinister smile . “ Oh , Rodya , hush ! ” cried Dounia bitterly . Silence lasted for two minute . He sat with his eye fixed on the floor ; Dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish . Suddenly he got up . “ It ’ s late , it ’ s time to go ! I am going at once to give myself up . But I don ’ t know why I am going to give myself up. ” Big tear fell down her cheek . “ You are cry , sister , but can you hold out your hand to me ? ” “ You doubted it ? ” She threw her arm round him . “ Aren ’ t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering ? ” she cried , holding him close and kissing him . “ Crime ? What crime ? ” he cried in sudden fury . “ That I killed a vile noxious insect , an old pawnbroker woman , of use to no one ! ... Killing her wa atonement for forty sin . She wa sucking the life out of poor people . Was that a crime ? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking of expiating it , and why are you all rubbing it in on all side ? ‘ A crime ! a crime ! ’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice , now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace . It ’ s simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to , perhaps too for my advantage , a that ... Porfiry ... suggested ! ” “ Brother , brother , what are you saying ? Why , you have shed blood ? ” cried Dounia in despair . “ Which all men shed , ” he put in almost frantically , “ which flow and ha always flowed in stream , which is spilt like champagne , and for which men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactor of mankind . Look into it more carefully and understand it ! I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundred , thousand of good deed to make up for that one piece of stupidity , not stupidity even , simply clumsiness , for the idea wa by no mean so stupid a it seems now that it ha failed .... ( Everything seems stupid when it fails . ) By that stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position , to take the first step , to obtain mean , and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefit immeasurable in comparison .... But I ... I couldn ’ t carry out even the first step , because I am contemptible , that ’ s what ’ s the matter ! And yet I won ’ t look at it a you do . If I had succeeded I should have been crowned with glory , but now I ’ m trapped. ” “ But that ’ s not so , not so ! Brother , what are you saying ? ” “ Ah , it ’ s not picturesque , not æsthetically attractive ! I fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable . The fear of appearance is the first symptom of impotence . I ’ ve never , never recognised this more clearly than now , and I am further than ever from seeing that what I did wa a crime . I ’ ve never , never been stronger and more convinced than now. ” The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face , but a he uttered his last explanation , he happened to meet Dounia ’ s eye and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked . He felt that he had , anyway , made these two poor woman miserable , that he wa , anyway , the cause ... “ Dounia darling , if I am guilty forgive me ( though I can not be forgiven if I am guilty ) . Good-bye ! We won ’ t dispute . It ’ s time , high time to go . Don ’ t follow me , I beseech you , I have somewhere else to go .... But you go at once and sit with mother . I entreat you to ! It ’ s my last request of you . Don ’ t leave her at all ; I left her in a state of anxiety , that she is not fit to bear ; she will die or go out of her mind . Be with her ! Razumihin will be with you . I ’ ve been talking to him .... Don ’ t cry about me : I ’ ll try to be honest and manly all my life , even if I am a murderer . Perhaps I shall some day make a name . I won ’ t disgrace you , you will see ; I ’ ll still show .... Now good-bye for the present , ” he concluded hurriedly , noticing again a strange expression in Dounia ’ s eye at his last word and promise . “ Why are you cry ? Don ’ t cry , don ’ t cry : we are not parting for ever ! Ah , yes ! Wait a minute , I ’ d forgotten ! ” He went to the table , took up a thick dusty book , opened it and took from between the page a little water-colour portrait on ivory . It wa the portrait of his landlady ’ s daughter , who had died of fever , that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun . For a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed , kissed the portrait and gave it to Dounia . “ I used to talk a great deal about it to her , only to her , ” he said thoughtfully . “ To her heart I confided much of what ha since been so hideously realised . Don ’ t be uneasy , ” he returned to Dounia , “ she wa a much opposed to it a you , and I am glad that she is gone . The great point is that everything now is going to be different , is going to be broken in two , ” he cried , suddenly returning to his dejection . “ Everything , everything , and am I prepared for it ? Do I want it myself ? They say it is necessary for me to suffer ! What ’ s the object of these senseless suffering ? shall I know any better what they are for , when I am crushed by hardship and idiocy , and weak a an old man after twenty year ’ penal servitude ? And what shall I have to live for then ? Why am I consenting to that life now ? Oh , I knew I wa contemptible when I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day ! ” At last they both went out . It wa hard for Dounia , but she loved him . She walked away , but after going fifty pace she turned round to look at him again . He wa still in sight . At the corner he too turned and for the last time their eye met ; but noticing that she wa looking at him , he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation , and turned the corner abruptly . “ I am wicked , I see that , ” he thought to himself , feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia . “ But why are they so fond of me if I don ’ t deserve it ? Oh , if only I were alone and no one loved me and I too had never loved anyone ! _Nothing of all this would have happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty year grow so meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that I am a criminal ? Yes , that ’ s it , that ’ s it , that ’ s what they are sending me there for , that ’ s what they want . Look at them running to and fro about the street , every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and , worse still , an idiot . But try to get me off and they ’ d be wild with righteous indignation . Oh , how I hate them all ! ” He fell to musing by what process it could come to pas , that he could be humbled before all of them , indiscriminately -- humbled by conviction . And yet why not ? It must be so . Would not twenty year of continual bondage crush him utterly ? Water wear out a stone . And why , why should he live after that ? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be so ? It wa the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous evening , but still he went . CHAPTER VIII When he went into Sonia ’ s room , it wa already getting dark . All day Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety . Dounia had been waiting with her . She had come to her that morning , remembering Svidrigaïlov ’ s word that Sonia knew . We will not describe the conversation and tear of the two girl , and how friendly they became . Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview , that her brother would not be alone . He had gone to her , Sonia , first with his confession ; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it ; she would go with him wherever fate might send him . Dounia did not ask , but she knew it wa so . She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it . Sonia wa almost on the point of tear . She felt herself , on the contrary , hardly worthy to look at Dounia . Dounia ’ s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov ’ s room had remained in her mind a one of the fairest vision of her life . Dounia at last became impatient and , leaving Sonia , went to her brother ’ s room to await him there ; she kept thinking that he would come there first . When she had gone , Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide , and Dounia too feared it . But they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be , and both were le anxious while they were together . As soon a they parted , each thought of nothing else . Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternative -- Siberia or ... Besides she knew his vanity , his pride and his lack of faith . “ Is it possible that he ha nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live ? ” she thought at last in despair . Meanwhile the sun wa setting . Sonia wa standing in dejection , looking intently out of the window , but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house . At last when she began to feel sure of his death -- he walked into the room . She gave a cry of joy , but looking carefully into his face she turned pale . “ Yes , ” said Raskolnikov , smiling . “ I have come for your cross , Sonia . It wa you told me to go to the cross-roads ; why is it you are frightened now it ’ s come to that ? ” Sonia gazed at him astonished . His tone seemed strange to her ; a cold shiver ran over her , but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the word were a mask . He spoke to her looking away , a though to avoid meeting her eye . “ You see , Sonia , I ’ ve decided that it will be better so . There is one fact .... But it ’ s a long story and there ’ s no need to discus it . But do you know what anger me ? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish face will be gaping at me directly , pestering me with their stupid question , which I shall have to answer -- they ’ ll point their finger at me .... Tfoo ! You know I am not going to Porfiry , I am sick of him . I ’ d rather go to my friend , the Explosive Lieutenant ; how I shall surprise him , what a sensation I shall make ! But I must be cooler ; I ’ ve become too irritable of late . You know I wa nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now , because she turned to take a last look at me . It ’ s a brutal state to be in ! Ah ! what am I coming to ! Well , where are the cross ? ” He seemed hardly to know what he wa doing . He could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything ; his idea seemed to gallop after one another , he talked incoherently , his hand trembled slightly . Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two cross , one of cypress wood and one of copper . She made the sign of the cross over herself and over him , and put the wooden cross on his neck . “ It ’ s the symbol of my taking up the cross , ” he laughed . “ As though I had not suffered much till now ! The wooden cross , that is the peasant one ; the copper one , that is Lizaveta ’ s -- you will wear yourself , show me ! So she had it on ... at that moment ? I remember two thing like these too , a silver one and a little ikon . I threw them back on the old woman ’ s neck . Those would be appropriate now , really , those are what I ought to put on now .... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what matter ; I ’ m somehow forgetful .... You see I have come to warn you , Sonia , so that you might know ... that ’ s all -- that ’ s all I came for . But I thought I had more to say . You wanted me to go yourself . Well , now I am going to prison and you ’ ll have your wish . Well , what are you cry for ? You too ? Don ’ t . Leave off ! Oh , how I hate it all ! ” But his feeling wa stirred ; his heart ached , a he looked at her . “ Why is she grieving too ? ” he thought to himself . “ What am I to her ? Why doe she weep ? Why is she looking after me , like my mother or Dounia ? She ’ ll be my nurse. ” “ Cross yourself , say at least one prayer , ” Sonia begged in a timid broken voice . “ Oh certainly , a much a you like ! And sincerely , Sonia , sincerely .... ” But he wanted to say something quite different . He crossed himself several time . Sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head . It wa the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken , “ the family shawl. ” Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it , but he did not ask . He began to feel himself that he wa certainly forgetting thing and wa disgustingly agitated . He wa frightened at this . He wa suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia meant to go with him . “ What are you doing ? Where are you going ? Stay here , stay ! I ’ ll go alone , ” he cried in cowardly vexation , and almost resentful , he moved towards the door . “ What ’ s the use of going in procession ? ” he muttered going out . Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room . He had not even said good-bye to her ; he had forgotten her . A poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart . “ Was it right , wa it right , all this ? ” he thought again a he went down the stair . “ Couldn ’ t he stop and retract it all ... and not go ? ” But still he went . He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn ’ t ask himself question . As he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia , that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl , not daring to stir after he had shouted at her , and he stopped short for a moment . At the same instant , another thought dawned upon him , a though it had been lying in wait to strike him then . “ Why , with what object did I go to her just now ? I told her -- on business ; on what business ? I had no sort of business ! To tell her I wa _going_ ; but where wa the need ? Do I love her ? No , no , I drove her away just now like a dog . Did I want her cross ? Oh , how low I ’ ve sunk ! No , I wanted her tear , I wanted to see her terror , to see how her heart ached ! I had to have something to cling to , something to delay me , some friendly face to see ! And I dared to believe in myself , to dream of what I would do ! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch , contemptible ! ” He walked along the canal bank , and he had not much further to go . But on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market . He looked eagerly to right and left , gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything ; everything slipped away . “ In another week , another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge , how shall I look at the canal then ? I should like to remember this ! ” slipped into his mind . “ Look at this sign ! How shall I read those letter then ? It ’ s written here ‘ Campany , ’ that ’ s a thing to remember , that letter _a_ , and to look at it again in a month -- how shall I look at it then ? What shall I be feeling and thinking then ? ... How trivial it all must be , what I am fretting about now ! Of course it must all be interesting ... in it way ... ( Ha-ha-ha ! What am I thinking about ? ) I am becoming a baby , I am showing off to myself ; why am I ashamed ? Foo ! how people shove ! that fat man -- a German he must be -- who pushed against me , doe he know whom he pushed ? There ’ s a peasant woman with a baby , begging . It ’ s curious that she think me happier than she is . I might give her something , for the incongruity of it . Here ’ s a five copeck piece left in my pocket , where did I get it ? Here , here ... take it , my good woman ! ” “ God bless you , ” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice . He went into the Hay Market . It wa distasteful , very distasteful to be in a crowd , but he walked just where he saw most people . He would have given anything in the world to be alone ; but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment . There wa a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd ; he kept trying to dance and falling down . There wa a ring round him . Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd , stared for some minute at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh . A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him , though he still stared . He moved away at last , not remembering where he wa ; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him , overwhelming him body and mind . He suddenly recalled Sonia ’ s word , “ Go to the cross-roads , bow down to the people , kiss the earth , for you have sinned against it too , and say aloud to the whole world , ‘ I am a murderer. ’ ” He trembled , remembering that . And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time , especially of the last hour , had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed , complete sensation . It came over him like a fit ; it wa like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him . Everything in him softened at once and the tear started into his eye . He fell to the earth on the spot .... He knelt down in the middle of the square , bowed down to the earth , and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture . He got up and bowed down a second time . “ He ’ s boozed , ” a youth near him observed . There wa a roar of laughter . “ He ’ s going to Jerusalem , brother , and saying good-bye to his child and his country . He ’ s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and it pavement , ” added a workman who wa a little drunk . “ Quite a young man , too ! ” observed a third . “ And a gentleman , ” someone observed soberly . “ There ’ s no knowing who ’ s a gentleman and who isn ’ t nowadays. ” These exclamation and remark checked Raskolnikov , and the word , “ I am a murderer , ” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lip , died away . He bore these remark quietly , however , and , without looking round , he turned down a street leading to the police office . He had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him ; he had felt that it must be so . The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he saw , standing fifty pace from him on the left , Sonia . She wa hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanty in the market-place . She had followed him then on his painful way ! Raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia wa with him for ever and would follow him to the end of the earth , wherever fate might take him . It wrung his heart ... but he wa just reaching the fatal place . He went into the yard fairly resolutely . He had to mount to the third storey . “ I shall be some time going up , ” he thought . He felt a though the fateful moment wa still far off , a though he had plenty of time left for consideration . Again the same rubbish , the same eggshell lying about on the spiral stair , again the open door of the flat , again the same kitchen and the same fume and stench coming from them . Raskolnikov had not been here since that day . His leg were numb and gave way under him , but still they moved forward . He stopped for a moment to take breath , to collect himself , so a to enter _like a man_ . “ But why ? what for ? ” he wondered , reflecting . “ If I must drink the cup what difference doe it make ? The more revolting the better. ” He imagined for an instant the figure of the “ explosive lieutenant , ” Ilya Petrovitch . Was he actually going to him ? Couldn ’ t he go to someone else ? To Nikodim Fomitch ? Couldn ’ t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch ’ s lodging ? At least then it would be done privately .... No , no ! To the “ explosive lieutenant ” ! If he must drink it , drink it off at once . Turning cold and hardly conscious , he opened the door of the office . There were very few people in it this time -- only a house porter and a peasant . The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen . Raskolnikov walked into the next room . “ Perhaps I still need not speak , ” passed through his mind . Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform wa settling himself at a bureau to write . In a corner another clerk wa seating himself . Zametov wa not there , nor , of course , Nikodim Fomitch . “ No one in ? ” Raskolnikov asked , addressing the person at the bureau . “ Whom do you want ? ” “ A-ah ! Not a sound wa heard , not a sight wa seen , but I scent the Russian ... how doe it go on in the fairy tale ... I ’ ve forgotten ! ‘ At your service ! ’ ” a familiar voice cried suddenly . Raskolnikov shuddered . The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him . He had just come in from the third room . “ It is the hand of fate , ” thought Raskolnikov . “ Why is he here ? ” “ You ’ ve come to see u ? What about ? ” cried Ilya Petrovitch . He wa obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated . “ If it ’ s on business you are rather early . [ * ] It ’ s only a chance that I am here ... however I ’ ll do what I can . I must admit , I ... what is it , what is it ? Excuse me .... ” [ * ] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he wa reproached for coming too late. -- TRANSLATOR . “ Raskolnikov. ” “ Of course , Raskolnikov . You didn ’ t imagine I ’ d forgotten ? Don ’ t think I am like that ... Rodion Ro -- Ro -- Rodionovitch , that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ? ” “ Rodion Romanovitch. ” “ Yes , yes , of course , Rodion Romanovitch ! I wa just getting at it . I made many inquiry about you . I assure you I ’ ve been genuinely grieved since that ... since I behaved like that ... it wa explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man ... and a learned one too ... and so to say the first step ... Mercy on u ! What literary or scientific man doe not begin by some originality of conduct ! My wife and I have the greatest respect for literature , in my wife it ’ s a genuine passion ! Literature and art ! If only a man is a gentleman , all the rest can be gained by talent , learning , good sense , genius . As for a hat -- well , what doe a hat matter ? I can buy a hat a easily a I can a bun ; but what ’ s under the hat , what the hat cover , I can ’ t buy that ! I wa even meaning to come and apologise to you , but thought maybe you ’ d ... But I am forgetting to ask you , is there anything you want really ? I hear your family have come ? ” “ Yes , my mother and sister. ” “ I ’ ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister -- a highly cultivated and charming person . I confess I wa sorry I got so hot with you . There it is ! But a for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit -- that affair ha been cleared up splendidly ! Bigotry and fanaticism ! I understand your indignation . Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family ’ s arriving ? ” “ No , I only looked in ... I came to ask ... I thought that I should find Zametov here. ” “ Oh , yes ! Of course , you ’ ve made friend , I heard . Well , no , Zametov is not here . Yes , we ’ ve lost Zametov . He ’ s not been here since yesterday ... he quarrelled with everyone on leaving ... in the rudest way . He is a feather-headed youngster , that ’ s all ; one might have expected something from him , but there , you know what they are , our brilliant young men . He wanted to go in for some examination , but it ’ s only to talk and boast about it , it will go no further than that . Of course it ’ s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there , your friend . Your career is an intellectual one and you won ’ t be deterred by failure . For you , one may say , all the attraction of life _nihil est_ -- you are an ascetic , a monk , a hermit ! ... A book , a pen behind your ear , a learned research -- that ’ s where your spirit soar ! I am the same way myself .... Have you read Livingstone ’ s Travels ? ” “ No. ” “ Oh , I have . There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays , you know , and indeed it is not to be wondered at . What sort of day are they ? I ask you . But we thought ... you are not a Nihilist of course ? Answer me openly , openly ! ” “ N-no ... ” “ Believe me , you can speak openly to me a you would to yourself ! Official duty is one thing but ... you are thinking I meant to say _friendship_ is quite another ? No , you ’ re wrong ! It ’ s not friendship , but the feeling of a man and a citizen , the feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty . I may be an official , but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen .... You were asking about Zametov . Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputation , over a glass of champagne ... that ’ s all your Zametov is good for ! While I ’ m perhaps , so to speak , burning with devotion and lofty feeling , and besides I have rank , consequence , a post ! I am married and have child , I fulfil the duty of a man and a citizen , but who is he , may I ask ? I appeal to you a a man ennobled by education ... Then these midwife , too , have become extraordinarily numerous. ” Raskolnikov raised his eyebrow inquiringly . The word of Ilya Petrovitch , who had obviously been dining , were for the most part a stream of empty sound for him . But some of them he understood . He looked at him inquiringly , not knowing how it would end . “ I mean those crop-headed wench , ” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch continued . “ Midwives is my name for them . I think it a very satisfactory one , ha-ha ! They go to the Academy , study anatomy . If I fall ill , am I to send for a young lady to treat me ? What do you say ? Ha-ha ! ” Ilya Petrovitch laughed , quite pleased with his own wit . “ It ’ s an immoderate zeal for education , but once you ’ re educated , that ’ s enough . Why abuse it ? Why insult honourable people , a that scoundrel Zametov doe ? Why did he insult me , I ask you ? Look at these suicide , too , how common they are , you can ’ t fancy ! People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves , boy and girl and old people . Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town . Nil Pavlitch , I say , what wa the name of that gentleman who shot himself ? ” “ Svidrigaïlov , ” someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness . Raskolnikov started . “ Svidrigaïlov ! Svidrigaïlov ha shot himself ! ” he cried . “ What , do you know Svidrigaïlov ? ” “ Yes ... I knew him .... He hadn ’ t been here long. ” “ Yes , that ’ s so . He had lost his wife , wa a man of reckless habit and all of a sudden shot himself , and in such a shocking way .... He left in his notebook a few word : that he dy in full possession of his faculty and that no one is to blame for his death . He had money , they say . How did you come to know him ? ” “ I ... wa acquainted ... my sister wa governess in his family. ” “ Bah-bah-bah ! Then no doubt you can tell u something about him . You had no suspicion ? ” “ I saw him yesterday ... he ... wa drinking wine ; I knew nothing. ” Raskolnikov felt a though something had fallen on him and wa stifling him . “ You ’ ve turned pale again . It ’ s so stuffy here ... ” “ Yes , I must go , ” muttered Raskolnikov . “ Excuse my troubling you .... ” “ Oh , not at all , a often a you like . It ’ s a pleasure to see you and I am glad to say so. ” Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand . “ I only wanted ... I came to see Zametov. ” “ I understand , I understand , and it ’ s a pleasure to see you. ” “ I ... am very glad ... good-bye , ” Raskolnikov smiled . He went out ; he reeled , he wa overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he wa doing . He began going down the stair , supporting himself with his right hand against the wall . He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office , that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shouted . He went down and out into the yard . There , not far from the entrance , stood Sonia , pale and horror-stricken . She looked wildly at him . He stood still before her . There wa a look of poignant agony , of despair , in her face . She clasped her hand . His lip worked in an ugly , meaningless smile . He stood still a minute , grinned and went back to the police office . Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and wa rummaging among some paper . Before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stair . “ Hulloa ! Back again ! have you left something behind ? What ’ s the matter ? ” Raskolnikov , with white lip and staring eye , came slowly nearer . He walked right to the table , leaned his hand on it , tried to say something , but could not ; only incoherent sound were audible . “ You are feeling ill , a chair ! Here , sit down ! Some water ! ” Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair , but he kept his eye fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch , which expressed unpleasant surprise . Both looked at one another for a minute and waited . Water wa brought . “ It wa I ... ” began Raskolnikov . “ Drink some water. ” Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand , and softly and brokenly , but distinctly said : “ _It wa I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them._ ” Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth . People ran up on all side . Raskolnikov repeated his statement . EPILOGUE I Siberia . On the bank of a broad solitary river stand a town , one of the administrative centre of Russia ; in the town there is a fortress , in the fortress there is a prison . In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov ha been confined for nine month . Almost a year and a half ha passed since his crime . There had been little difficulty about his trial . The criminal adhered exactly , firmly , and clearly to his statement . He did not confuse nor misrepresent the fact , nor soften them in his own interest , nor omit the smallest detail . He explained every incident of the murder , the secret of _the pledge_ ( the piece of wood with a strip of metal ) which wa found in the murdered woman ’ s hand . He described minutely how he had taken her key , what they were like , a well a the chest and it content ; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta ’ s murder ; described how Koch and , after him , the student knocked , and repeated all they had said to one another ; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting ; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home . He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinket were found . The whole thing , in fact , wa perfectly clear . The lawyer and the judge were very much struck , among other thing , by the fact that he had hidden the trinket and the purse under a stone , without making use of them , and that , what wa more , he did not now remember what the trinket were like , or even how many there were . The fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much wa in it seemed incredible . There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen rouble and sixty copeck . From being so long under the stone , some of the most valuable note lying uppermost had suffered from the damp . They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this , when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession . Finally some of the lawyer more versed in psychology admitted that it wa possible he had really not looked into the purse , and so didn ’ t know what wa in it when he hid it under the stone . But they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement , through homicidal mania , without object or the pursuit of gain . This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity , so often applied in our day in criminal case . Moreover Raskolnikov ’ s hypochondriacal condition wa proved by many witness , by Dr. Zossimov , his former fellow student , his landlady and her servant . All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov wa not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber , but that there wa another element in the case . To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion , the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself . To the decisive question a to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery , he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause wa his miserable position , his poverty and helplessness , and his desire to provide for his first step in life by the help of the three thousand rouble he had reckoned on finding . He had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature , exasperated moreover by privation and failure . To the question what led him to confess , he answered that it wa his heartfelt repentance . All this wa almost coarse .... The sentence however wa more merciful than could have been expected , perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself , but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt . All the strange and peculiar circumstance of the crime were taken into consideration . There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time . The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen wa put down partly to the effect of remorse , partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime . Incidentally the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis : a man commits two murder and forgets that the door is open ! Finally , the confession , at the very moment when the case wa hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism , and when , moreover , there were no proof against the real criminal , no suspicion even ( Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word ) -- all this did much to soften the sentence . Other circumstance , too , in the prisoner ’ s favour came out quite unexpectedly . Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Raskolnikov wa at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six month , and when this student died , leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year , Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died . Raskolnikov ’ s landlady bore witness , too , that when they had lived in another house at Five Corners , Raskolnikov had rescued two little child from a house on fire and wa burnt in doing so . This wa investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witness . These fact made an impression in his favour . And in the end the criminal wa , in consideration of extenuating circumstance , condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight year only . At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov ’ s mother fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial . Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg , so a to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna a often a possible . Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s illness wa a strange nervous one and wa accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect . When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother , she had found her mother already ill , in feverish delirium . That evening Razumihin and she agreed what answer they must make to her mother ’ s question about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother ’ s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia on a business commission , which would bring him in the end money and reputation . But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject , neither then nor thereafter . On the contrary , she had her own version of her son ’ s sudden departure ; she told them with tear how he had come to say good-bye to her , hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important fact , and that Rodya had many very powerful enemy , so that it wa necessary for him to be in hiding . As for his future career , she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influence could be removed . She assured Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman , that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it . This article she wa continually reading , she even read it aloud , almost took it to bed with her , but scarcely asked where Rodya wa , though the subject wa obviously avoided by the others , which might have been enough to awaken her suspicion . They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s strange silence on certain subject . She did not , for instance , complain of getting no letter from him , though in previous year she had only lived on the hope of letter from her beloved Rodya . This wa the cause of great uneasiness to Dounia ; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there wa something terrible in her son ’ s fate and wa afraid to ask , for fear of hearing something still more awful . In any case , Dounia saw clearly that her mother wa not in full possession of her faculty . It happened once or twice , however , that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it wa impossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodya wa , and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answer she became at once gloomy and silent , and this mood lasted for a long time . Dounia saw at last that it wa hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it wa better to be absolutely silent on certain point ; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible . Dounia remembered her brother ’ s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the fatal day of the confession : had not she made out something from that ? Sometimes day and even week of gloomy silence and tear would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation , and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son , of her hope of his future .... Her fancy were sometimes very strange . They humoured her , pretended to agree with her ( she saw perhaps that they were pretending ) , but she still went on talking . Five month after Raskolnikov ’ s confession , he wa sentenced . Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison a often a it wa possible . At last the moment of separation came . Dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever , Razumihin did the same . Razumihin , in his youthful ardour , had firmly resolved to lay the foundation at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four year , and saving up a certain sum , to emigrate to Siberia , a country rich in every natural resource and in need of worker , active men and capital . There they would settle in the town where Rodya wa and all together would begin a new life . They all wept at parting . Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few day before . He asked a great deal about his mother and wa constantly anxious about her . He worried so much about her that it alarmed Dounia . When he heard about his mother ’ s illness he became very gloomy . With Sonia he wa particularly reserved all the time . With the help of the money left to her by Svidrigaïlov , Sonia had long ago made her preparation to follow the party of convict in which he wa despatched to Siberia . Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject , but both knew it would be so . At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his sister ’ s and Razumihin ’ s fervent anticipation of their happy future together when he should come out of prison . He predicted that their mother ’ s illness would soon have a fatal ending . Sonia and he at last set off . Two month later Dounia wa married to Razumihin . It wa a quiet and sorrowful wedding ; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however . During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination . Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plan and indeed she could not but believe in him . He displayed a rare strength of will . Among other thing he began attending university lecture again in order to take his degree . They were continually making plan for the future ; both counted on settling in Siberia within five year at least . Till then they rested their hope on Sonia . Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa delighted to give her blessing to Dounia ’ s marriage with Razumihin ; but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious . To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little child from a fire . These two piece of news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy . She wa continually talking about them , even entering into conversation with stranger in the street , though Dounia always accompanied her . In public conveyance and shop , wherever she could capture a listener , she would begin the discourse about her son , his article , how he had helped the student , how he had been burnt at the fire , and so on ! Dounia did not know how to restrain her . Apart from the danger of her morbid excitement , there wa the risk of someone ’ s recalling Raskolnikov ’ s name and speaking of the recent trial . Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two child her son had saved and insisted on going to see her . At last her restlessness reached an extreme point . She would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and wa often ill and feverishly delirious . One morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home , that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine month . She began to prepare for his coming , began to do up her room for him , to clean the furniture , to wash and put up new hanging and so on . Dounia wa anxious , but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room . After a fatiguing day spent in continual fancy , in joyful day-dreams and tear , Pulcheria Alexandrovna wa taken ill in the night and by morning she wa feverish and delirious . It wa brain fever . She died within a fortnight . In her delirium she dropped word which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son ’ s terrible fate than they had supposed . For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother ’ s death , though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia . It wa carried on by mean of Sonia , who wrote every month to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity . At first they found Sonia ’ s letter dry and unsatisfactory , but later on they came to the conclusion that the letter could not be better , for from these letter they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother ’ s life . Sonia ’ s letter were full of the most matter-of-fact detail , the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov ’ s surroundings a a convict . There wa no word of her own hope , no conjecture a to the future , no description of her feeling . Instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life , she gave the simple fact -- that is , his own word , an exact account of his health , what he asked for at their interview , what commission he gave her and so on . All these fact she gave with extraordinary minuteness . The picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision . There could be no mistake , because nothing wa given but fact . But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news , especially at first . Sonia wrote that he wa constantly sullen and not ready to talk , that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letter , that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when , seeing that he had guessed the truth , she told him at last of her death , she wa surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it , not externally at any rate . She told them that , although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and , a it were , shut himself off from everyone -- he took a very direct and simple view of his new life ; that he understood his position , expected nothing better for the time , had no ill-founded hope ( a is so common in his position ) and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings , so unlike anything he had known before . She wrote that his health wa satisfactory ; he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more ; he wa almost indifferent about food , but except on Sundays and holiday the food wa so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her , Sonia , to have his own tea every day . He begged her not to trouble about anything else , declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him . Sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest , that she had not seen the inside of their barrack , but concluded that they were crowded , miserable and unhealthy ; that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and wa unwilling to make any other arrangement . But that he lived so poorly and roughly , not from any plan or design , but simply from inattention and indifference . Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visit , had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming , unwilling to talk and rude to her . But that in the end these visit had become a habit and almost a necessity for him , so that he wa positively distressed when she wa ill for some day and could not visit him . She used to see him on holiday at the prison gate or in the guard-room , to which he wa brought for a few minute to see her . On working day she would go to see him at work either at the workshop or at the brick kiln , or at the shed on the bank of the Irtish . About herself , Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintance in the town , that she did sewing , and , a there wa scarcely a dressmaker in the town , she wa looked upon a an indispensable person in many house . But she did not mention that the authority were , through her , interested in Raskolnikov ; that his task wa lightened and so on . At last the news came ( Dounia had indeed noticed sign of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letter ) that he held aloof from everyone , that his fellow prisoner did not like him , that he kept silent for day at a time and wa becoming very pale . In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and wa in the convict ward of the hospital . II He wa ill a long time . But it wa not the horror of prison life , not the hard labour , the bad food , the shaven head , or the patched clothes that crushed him . What did he care for all those trial and hardship ! he wa even glad of the hard work . Physically exhausted , he could at least reckon on a few hour of quiet sleep . And what wa the food to him -- the thin cabbage soup with beetle floating in it ? In the past a a student he had often not had even that . His clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life . He did not even feel the fetter . Was he ashamed of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat ? Before whom ? Before Sonia ? Sonia wa afraid of him , how could he be ashamed before her ? And yet he wa ashamed even before Sonia , whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner . But it wa not his shaven head and his fetter he wa ashamed of : his pride had been stung to the quick . It wa wounded pride that made him ill. Oh , how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself ! He could have borne anything then , even shame and disgrace . But he judged himself severely , and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past , except a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone . He wa ashamed just because he , Raskolnikov , had so hopelessly , stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate , and must humble himself and submit to “ the idiocy ” of a sentence , if he were anyhow to be at peace . Vague and objectless anxiety in the present , and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing -- that wa all that lay before him . And what comfort wa it to him that at the end of eight year he would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life ! What had he to live for ? What had he to look forward to ? Why should he strive ? To live in order to exist ? Why , he had been ready a thousand time before to give up existence for the sake of an idea , for a hope , even for a fancy . Mere existence had always been too little for him ; he had always wanted more . Perhaps it wa just because of the strength of his desire that he had thought himself a man to whom more wa permissible than to others . And if only fate would have sent him repentance -- burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep , that repentance , the awful agony of which brings vision of hanging or drowning ! Oh , he would have been glad of it ! Tears and agony would at least have been life . But he did not repent of his crime . At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity , a he had raged at the grotesque blunder that had brought him to prison . But now in prison , _in freedom_ , he thought over and criticised all his action again and by no mean found them so blundering and so grotesque a they had seemed at the fatal time . “ In what way , ” he asked himself , “ wa my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world ? One ha only to look at the thing quite independently , broadly , and uninfluenced by commonplace idea , and my idea will by no mean seem so ... strange . Oh , sceptic and halfpenny philosopher , why do you halt half-way ! “ Why doe my action strike them a so horrible ? ” he said to himself . “ Is it because it wa a crime ? What is meant by crime ? My conscience is at rest . Of course , it wa a legal crime , of course , the letter of the law wa broken and blood wa shed . Well , punish me for the letter of the law ... and that ’ s enough . Of course , in that case many of the benefactor of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first step . But those men succeeded and so _they were right_ , and I didn ’ t , and so I had no right to have taken that step. ” It wa only in that that he recognised his criminality , only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it . He suffered too from the question : why had he not killed himself ? Why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess ? Was the desire to live so strong and wa it so hard to overcome it ? Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it , although he wa afraid of death ? In misery he asked himself this question , and could not understand that , at the very time he had been standing looking into the river , he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his conviction . He didn ’ t understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis , of a new view of life and of his future resurrection . He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over , again through weakness and meanness . He looked at his fellow prisoner and wa amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it . It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom . What terrible agony and privation some of them , the tramp for instance , had endured ! Could they care so much for a ray of sunshine , for the primeval forest , the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot , which the tramp had marked three year before , and longed to see again , a he might to see his sweetheart , dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush ? As he went on he saw still more inexplicable example . In prison , of course , there wa a great deal he did not see and did not want to see ; he lived a it were with downcast eye . It wa loathsome and unbearable for him to look . But in the end there wa much that surprised him and he began , a it were involuntarily , to notice much that he had not suspected before . What surprised him most of all wa the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest . They seemed to be a different specie , and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility . He felt and knew the reason of his isolation , but he would never have admitted till then that those reason were so deep and strong . There were some Polish exile , political prisoner , among them . They simply looked down upon all the rest a ignorant churl ; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that . He saw that these ignorant men were in many respect far wiser than the Poles . There were some Russians who were just a contemptuous , a former officer and two seminarist . Raskolnikov saw their mistake a clearly . He wa disliked and avoided by everyone ; they even began to hate him at last -- why , he could not tell . Men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime . “ You ’ re a gentleman , ” they used to say . “ You shouldn ’ t hack about with an axe ; that ’ s not a gentleman ’ s work. ” The second week in Lent , his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang . He went to church and prayed with the others . A quarrel broke out one day , he did not know how . All fell on him at once in a fury . “ You ’ re an infidel ! You don ’ t believe in God , ” they shouted . “ You ought to be killed. ” He had never talked to them about God nor his belief , but they wanted to kill him a an infidel . He said nothing . One of the prisoner rushed at him in a perfect frenzy . Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently ; his eyebrow did not quiver , his face did not flinch . The guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant , or there would have been bloodshed . There wa another question he could not decide : why were they all so fond of Sonia ? She did not try to win their favour ; she rarely met them , sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment . And yet everybody knew her , they knew that she had come out to follow _him_ , knew how and where she lived . She never gave them money , did them no particular service . Only once at Christmas she sent them all present of pie and roll . But by degree closer relation sprang up between them and Sonia . She would write and post letter for them to their relation . Relations of the prisoner who visited the town , at their instruction , left with Sonia present and money for them . Their wife and sweetheart knew her and used to visit her . And when she visited Raskolnikov at work , or met a party of the prisoner on the road , they all took off their hat to her . “ Little mother Sofya Semyonovna , you are our dear , good little mother , ” coarse branded criminal said to that frail little creature . She would smile and bow to them and everyone wa delighted when she smiled . They even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for . They even came to her for help in their illness . He wa in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter . When he wa better , he remembered the dream he had had while he wa feverish and delirious . He dreamt that the whole world wa condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depth of Asia . All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen . Some new sort of microbe were attacking the body of men , but these microbe were endowed with intelligence and will . Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious . But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth a these sufferer , never had they considered their decision , their scientific conclusion , their moral conviction so infallible . Whole village , whole town and people went mad from the infection . All were excited and did not understand one another . Each thought that he alone had the truth and wa wretched looking at the others , beat himself on the breast , wept , and wrung his hand . They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good ; they did not know whom to blame , whom to justify . Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite . They gathered together in army against one another , but even on the march the army would begin attacking each other , the rank would be broken and the soldier would fall on each other , stabbing and cutting , biting and devouring each other . The alarm bell wa ringing all day long in the town ; men rushed together , but why they were summoned and who wa summoning them no one knew . The most ordinary trade were abandoned , because everyone proposed his own idea , his own improvement , and they could not agree . The land too wa abandoned . Men met in group , agreed on something , swore to keep together , but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed . They accused one another , fought and killed each other . There were conflagration and famine . All men and all thing were involved in destruction . The plague spread and moved further and further . Only a few men could be saved in the whole world . They were a pure chosen people , destined to found a new race and a new life , to renew and purify the earth , but no one had seen these men , no one had heard their word and their voice . Raskolnikov wa worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so miserably , the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long . The second week after Easter had come . There were warm bright spring day ; in the prison ward the grating window under which the sentinel paced were opened . Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness ; each time she had to obtain permission , and it wa difficult . But she often used to come to the hospital yard , especially in the evening , sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the window of the ward . One evening , when he wa almost well again , Raskolnikov fell asleep . On waking up he chanced to go to the window , and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate . She seemed to be waiting for someone . Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute . He shuddered and moved away from the window . Next day Sonia did not come , nor the day after ; he noticed that he wa expecting her uneasily . At last he wa discharged . On reaching the prison he learnt from the convict that Sofya Semyonovna wa lying ill at home and wa unable to go out . He wa very uneasy and sent to inquire after her ; he soon learnt that her illness wa not dangerous . Hearing that he wa anxious about her , Sonia sent him a pencilled note , telling him that she wa much better , that she had a slight cold and that she would soon , very soon come and see him at his work . His heart throbbed painfully a he read it . Again it wa a warm bright day . Early in the morning , at six o ’ clock , he went off to work on the river bank , where they used to pound alabaster and where there wa a kiln for baking it in a shed . There were only three of them sent . One of the convict went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool ; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln . Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank , sat down on a heap of log by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river . From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him , the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank . In the vast steppe , bathed in sunshine , he could just see , like black speck , the nomad ’ tent . There there wa freedom , there other men were living , utterly unlike those here ; there time itself seemed to stand still , a though the age of Abraham and his flock had not passed . Raskolnikov sat gazing , his thought passed into day-dreams , into contemplation ; he thought of nothing , but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him . Suddenly he found Sonia beside him ; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side . It wa still quite early ; the morning chill wa still keen . She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl ; her face still showed sign of illness , it wa thinner and paler . She gave him a joyful smile of welcome , but held out her hand with her usual timidity . She wa always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all , a though afraid he would repel it . He always took her hand a though with repugnance , always seemed vexed to meet her and wa sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit . Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved . But now their hand did not part . He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eye on the ground without speaking . They were alone , no one had seen them . The guard had turned away for the time . How it happened he did not know . But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her foot . He wept and threw his arm round her knee . For the first instant she wa terribly frightened and she turned pale . She jumped up and looked at him trembling . But at the same moment she understood , and a light of infinite happiness came into her eye . She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come .... They wanted to speak , but could not ; tear stood in their eye . They were both pale and thin ; but those sick pale face were bright with the dawn of a new future , of a full resurrection into a new life . They were renewed by love ; the heart of each held infinite source of life for the heart of the other . They resolved to wait and be patient . They had another seven year to wait , and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them ! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being , while she -- she only lived in his life . On the evening of the same day , when the barrack were locked , Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her . He had even fancied that day that all the convict who had been his enemy looked at him differently ; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way . He remembered that now , and thought it wa bound to be so . Wasn ’ t everything now bound to be changed ? He thought of her . He remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart . He remembered her pale and thin little face . But these recollection scarcely troubled him now ; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her suffering . And what were all , _all_ the agony of the past ! Everything , even his crime , his sentence and imprisonment , seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external , strange fact with which he had no concern . But he could not think for long together of anything that evening , and he could not have analysed anything consciously ; he wa simply feeling . Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind . Under his pillow lay the New Testament . He took it up mechanically . The book belonged to Sonia ; it wa the one from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him . At first he wa afraid that she would worry him about religion , would talk about the gospel and pester him with book . But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the Testament . He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word . Till now he had not opened it . He did not open it now , but one thought passed through his mind : “ Can her conviction not be mine now ? Her feeling , her aspiration at least .... ” She too had been greatly agitated that day , and at night she wa taken ill again . But she wa so happy -- and so unexpectedly happy -- that she wa almost frightened of her happiness . Seven year , _only_ seven year ! At the beginning of their happiness at some moment they were both ready to look on those seven year a though they were seven day . He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing , that he would have to pay dearly for it , that it would cost him great striving , great suffering . But that is the beginning of a new story -- the story of the gradual renewal of a man , the story of his gradual regeneration , of his passing from one world into another , of his initiation into a new unknown life . That might be the subject of a new story , but our present story is ended . * * * END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT * * * Updated edition will replace the previous one -- the old edition will be renamed .
